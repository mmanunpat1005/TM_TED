3,This is what enduring love looks like,Alec Soth and Stacey Baker,Jul 2015,"Stacey Baker has always been obsessed with how couples meet. When she asked photographer Alec Soth to help her explore this topic, they found themselves at the world's largest speed-dating event, held in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, and at the largest retirement community in Nevada — with Soth taking portraits of pairs in each locale. Between these two extremes, they unwound a beautiful through-line of how a couple goes from meeting to creating a life together.

I got a call from a woman in Texas, Stacey Baker, and she'd seen some of my photographs
in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission
me to take a portrait of her parents. Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey,
and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich, but it was only later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan
to make this happen. 00:29I took the picture of her parents, but I was actually more excited
about photographing Stacey. The picture I made that day ended up becoming
one of my best-known portraits. At the time I made this picture,
Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas. Not long after, she left her job
to study photography in Maine, and while she was there,
she ended up meeting the director of photography
at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job. Stacey Baker: In the years since,
Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together, and we've become friends. 01:07A few months ago, I started talking
to Alec about a fascination of mine. I've always been obsessed
with how couples meet. I asked Alec how he
and his wife Rachel met, and he told me the story
of a high school football game where she was 16 and he was 15, and he asked her out. He liked her purple hair. She said yes, and that was it. I then asked Alec if he'd be interested
in doing a photography project exploring this question. 01:37AS: And I was interested in the question,
but I was actually much more interested in Stacey's motivation for asking it, particularly since I'd never known
Stacey to have a boyfriend. So as part of this project,
I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone. So my idea was to have Stacey here
go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day. (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) 02:08SB: We ended up at what was advertised
as the world's largest speed dating event. I had 19 dates and each date lasted three minutes. Participants were given a list of ice-
breaker questions to get the ball rolling, things like, ""If you could be any kind
of animal, what would you be?"" That sort of thing. 02:28My first date was Colin. He's from England, and he once married a woman he met
after placing an ad for a Capricorn. Alec and I saw him
at the end of the evening, and he said he'd kissed a woman in line
at one of the concession stands. 02:45Zack and Chris came
to the date-a-thon together. 02:50This is Carl. I asked Carl, ""What's the first thing
you notice about a woman?"" He said, ""Tits."" (Laughter) 03:05Matthew is attracted to women
with muscular calves. We talked about running. He does
triathlons, I run half-marathons. Alec actually liked his eyes and asked
if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't, and I don't think he was
attracted to me either. 03:21Austin and Mike came together. Mike asked me a hypothetical question. He said, ""You're in an elevator
running late for a meeting. Someone makes a dash for the elevator. Do you hold it open for them?"" And I said I would not. (Laughter) 03:43Cliff said the first thing he notices
about a woman is her teeth, and we complimented each other's teeth. Because he's an open mouth sleeper, he says he has to floss more
to help prevent gum disease, and so I asked him how often he flosses, and he said, ""Every other day."" (Laughter) Now, as someone who flosses twice a day, I wasn't really sure that
that was flossing more but I don't think I said that out loud. 04:12Bill is an auditor, and we talked the entire three minutes
about auditing. (Laughter) 04:22The first thing Spencer notices
about a woman is her complexion. He feels a lot of women
wear too much makeup, and that they should only wear enough
to accentuate the features that they have. I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think
that that was a good thing. Craig told me he didn't think
I was willing to be vulnerable. He was also frustrated when I couldn't
remember my most embarrassing moment. He thought I was lying, but I wasn't. I didn't think he liked me at all,
but at the end of the night, he came back to me and he gave me
a box of chocolates. 04:57William was really difficult to talk to. I think he was drunk. (Laughter) 05:05Actor Chris McKenna
was the MC of the event. He used to be on
""The Young and the Restless."" I didn't actually go on a date with him. Alec said he saw several women
give their phone numbers to him. 05:18Needless to say, I didn't fall in love. I didn't feel a particular connection with
any of the men that I went on dates with, and I didn't feel like they felt
a particular connection with me either. 05:33AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me -- (Laughter) -- as a photographer
is the quality of vulnerability. The physical exterior reveals a crack
in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior. At this date-a-thon event,
I saw so many examples of that, but as I watched Stacey's dates
and talked to her about them, I realized how different
photographic love is from real love. 06:02What is real love? How does it work? In order to work on this question
and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date
to having a life together, Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin, which is the largest
retirement community in Las Vegas. Our contact there was George,
who runs the community's photography club. He arranged for us to meet other couples
in their makeshift photo studio. SB: After 45 years of marriage,
Anastasia's husband died two years ago, 06:37so we asked if she had
an old wedding picture. She met her husband
when she was a 15-year-old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan. He was 30. She'd lied about her age. He was the first person she'd dated. 06:53Dean had been named photographer of
the year in Las Vegas two years in a row, and this caught Alec's attention, as did the fact 
that he met his wife, Judy, at the same age when Alec met Rachel. Dean admitted that he likes
to look at beautiful women, but he's never questioned
his decision to marry Judy. 07:12AS: George met Josephine
at a parish dance. He was 18, she was 15. Like a lot of the couples we met,
they weren't especially philosophical about their early choices. George said something
that really stuck with me. He said, ""When you get that feeling,
you just go with it."" 07:34Bob and Trudy met on a blind date
when she was still in high school. They said they weren't particularly
attracted to each other when the first met. Nevertheless, they were
married soon after. 07:45SB: The story that stayed with me the most was that of George, the photography club
president, and his wife, Mary. This was George and Mary's
second marriage. They met at a country-western club
in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara. He was there alone drinking
and she was with friends. When they started dating,
he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes, and she offered to help him
get out of debt, so for the next year, he turned
his paychecks over to Mary, and she got him out of debt. George was actually an alcoholic
when they married, and Mary knew it. At some point in their marriage,
he says he consumed 54 beers in one day. Another time, when he was drunk,
he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids, but they escaped and a SWAT team
was called to the house. Amazingly, Mary took him back, and eventually things got better. George has been involved
in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in 36 years. 08:48(Music) 08:49At the end of the day,
after we left Sun City, I told Alec that I didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met
were all that interesting. What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together. 09:04AS: They all had this beautiful
quality of endurance, but that was true of the singles, too. The world is hard,
and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people, and the couples
were holding onto each other after all these decades. 09:23My favorite pictures on this trip
were of Joe and Roseanne. Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne, we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
if they had an old wedding photograph. In their case, they simultaneously
pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph. What's more beautiful,
I thought to myself, this image of a young couple
who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people
holding onto this image for decades? 09:58Thank you. 10:00(Applause)"
3,A queer vision of love and marriage,Tiq Milan and Kim Katrin Milan,Dec 2016,"Love is a tool for revolutionary change and a path toward inclusivity and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community. Married activists Tiq and Kim Katrin Milan have imagined their marriage -- as a transgender man and cis woman -- a model of possibility for people of every kind. With infectious joy, Tiq and Kim question our misconceptions about who they might be and offer a vision of an inclusive, challenging love that grows day by day.", (51K),"Transcript (19 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00Tiq Milan: Our first conversation
was on Facebook, and it was three days long. 00:05(Laughter) 00:07We shared over 3,000 messages between us, and it was during those 72 hours
that I knew she was going to be my wife. We didn't wait any prerequisite
amount of time for our courtship; we told each other
the vulnerable truths up front: I am a transgender man, which means the F on my birth
certificate should have stood for ""False,"" instead of ""Female."" 00:26(Laughter) 00:27Walking around as a woman in the world felt like walking with
pebbles in my shoes. It took the rhythm out of my swagger, it threw me off balance, it pained me with every step
I took forward. But today I'm a man of my own intention; a man of my own design. 00:42Kim Katrin Milan: I am
a cisgender queer woman. Cisgender means the gender
I was assigned at birth is still and has always been female. This doesn't make me natural or normal, this is just one way of describing
the many different ways that we exist in this world. And queer is a cultural term, but in this case, it refers to the way that I'm not
restricted by gender when it comes to choosing partners. I've identified in a few different ways -- as a bisexual, as a lesbian -- but for me, queerness encompasses all of the layers
of who I am and how I've loved. I'm layers, and not fractions. And for me, the fact that he was queer meant that I could trust his courtship
from the very beginning. 01:24As queer and trans people, we're so often excluded
from institutions and traditions. We create spaces outside of convention, including the conventions of time. And in those 3,000 messages between us, we collapsed time; we queered it; we laid it all on the table. 01:42(Laughter) 01:43With no pretense at all. And this meant that we were able
to commit to each other in a profoundly different way. 01:50So often what we're told is this idea
of the ""Golden Rule,"" that we should treat other people
the way we want to be treated. But the problem with that is that it assumes that we are
the standard for other people, and we're not. We need to treat other people
the way they want to be treated, which means we had to ask. I couldn't assume that the kind
of love that Tiq needed was the same kind of love that I needed. So I asked him everything --
about his fears, his insecurities -- and we started from there. 02:19TM: I didn't know what
kind of love I needed. I had just come out of a year-long fog of being rejected and utterly depleted. I had someone look me in my eyes and tell me that I was unworthy
of their love because I was trans. And there's a culture of lovelessness that we've created around
transgender people. It's reasoned, justified
and often signed into law. And I was a heartbeat away
from internalizing that message, that I wasn't worthy. But Kim said that I was her ideal -- the heartbroken mess that I was. 02:47(Laughter) 02:49KKM: He totally was my ideal. 02:51(Laughter) 02:52In more ways than one. Both poets, writers, creatives with a long history
of community work behind us, and big, huge dreams
of a family in front of us, we shared a lot of things in common, but we were also incredibly different. I've been a lifelong traveler
and a bit of an orphan, whereas he comes from a huge family, and definitely stays grounded. I often kind of sum up
the differences in our strengths by saying, ""Keep me safe, and I'll keep you wild."" 03:18(Laughter) 03:22TM: We have marginalized identities
but we don't live marginalized lives. Being queer and trans is about creating
new ways of existing. It's about loving people as they are, not as they're supposed to be. Kim is unapologetically feminine in a world that is often cruel and violent to women who are
too proud and too freeing. And I didn't enter into this union under the auspices that she
was going to be my helper or my rib, but a fully complex -- 03:48(Laughter) 03:49KKM: Right? That's not right. 03:52TM: But a fully complex human being whose femininity wasn't for me
to rein in, control or critique. It's her brilliance, the way she leads with compassion, and how she never loses
sight of her empathy. She has been my hero since day one. 04:06(Applause) 04:09KKM: Our relationship has always been
about setting each other free. One of the first questions I asked him was what dreams he had left to accomplish, and how would I help him get there. His dreams to live as a poet, to adopt and raise a family together, to live a life that he was proud of, and one that would live up to
his mother's incredible legacy. And I really appreciated that we
were able to start from that place, and not from a place
that was around figuring out how to make each other work together. And I think this really allowed us
to grow into the people that we were in a way that was incredibly different. I love him whole; pre-transition, now and in the future. And it's this love that had us
committed to each other before we'd even seen each other's faces. 04:54TM: My mother's biggest
concern when I transitioned was who was going to love me as I am. Had being transgender somehow
precluded me from love and monogamy because I was supposedly
born in the wrong body? But it's this type of structuring
that has to be reframed in order to let love in. My body never betrayed me, and my body was never wrong. It's this restrictive,
binary thinking on gender that said that I didn't exist. But when we met, she loved me for exactly how I showed up. She would trace her fingers
along the numb keloid scars left by my top surgery. Scars that run from the middle of my chest
all the way out to my outer torso. She said that these were
reminders of my strength and everything that I went through and nothing for me to be ashamed of. So sprinting towards her hand in marriage was the queerest thing that I could do. 05:45(Laughter) 05:47It flew in the face of more
conventional trajectories of love and relationships, because God was never supposed
to bless a union for folks like us, and the law was never
supposed to recognize it. 05:58KKM: So on May 5, 2014, just about three months
after meeting online, we were married on the steps
of City Hall in Manhattan, and it was beautiful
in every conceivable way. It's safe to say that we
reimagined some traditions, but we also kept some old ones
that we worked in, and we created something
that worked for us. My bouquet and corsage was actually filled
with wildflowers from Brooklyn -- also added in a little bit of lavender
and sage to keep us grounded because we were so nervous. And it was put together by a sweet
sister healer friend of ours. I never wanted a diamond ring, because conflict and convention
are not my thing, so my ring is the deepest purple, like the color of my crown chakra, and set in place with my birthstones. 06:47The gift of queerness is options. I never had to choose his last name, it was never an exception, but I did because I am
my father's bastard child, someone who has always been
an apology, a secret, an imposition. And it was incredibly freeing to choose the name of a man
who chose me first. 07:05(Applause) 07:12TM: So we told some family
and some close friends, many of whom were still in disbelief
as we took our vows. Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding
photos on Facebook, where we met -- and Instagram, of course. And we quickly realized that our coming together was more
than just a union of two people, but was a model of possibility
for the millions of LGBTQ folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony
is antithetical to who they are -- for those of us
who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness. 07:44KKM: And the thing is, absolutely we are marginalized
because of our identities, but it also emboldens us
to be the people that we are. Queerness is our major key; blackness is our magic. It's because of these things that we are able to be hopeful, open,
receptive and shape-shifting. These are the things that give us, and are such an incredible
source of, our strength. Our queerness is a source
of that strength. 08:09footnotefootnoteI think of the words of Ottawa-based
poet Brandon Wint: ""Not queer like gay;
queer like escaping definition. Queer like some sort of fluidity
and limitlessness all at once. Queer like a freedom
too strange to be conquered. Queer like the fearlessness
to imagine what love can look like, and to pursue it."" 08:30TM: We are part of a community of folks -- Yeah, that's good right? 08:33(Laughter) 08:36We are part of a community of folks
who are living their authentic selves all along the gender spectrum, despite the ubiquitous threat of violence, despite the undercurrent of anxiety
that always is present for people who live on their own terms. Globally, a transgender person
is murdered every 21 hours. And the United States has had more
trans murders on record this year than any year to date. However, our stories are much more
than this rigid dichotomy of strength and resilience. We are expanding the human
complexity on these margins, and we are creating freedom
on these margins. 09:16KKM: And we don't have any blueprints. We're creating a world
that we have literally never seen before; organizing families based
on love and not by blood, guiding by a compassion that so few of us
have been shown ourselves. 09:30So many of us have not received
love from our families -- have been betrayed by the people
that we trust most. So what we do here is we create
entirely new languages of love. Ones that are about creating the space
for us to be our authentic selves and not imposing this standard of what masculinity or femininity
is supposed to be. 09:52TM: We are interested
in love and inclusion as a tool of revolutionary change, right? And the idea is simply, if we drop all our preconceived notions about how somebody is supposed to be -- in their body, in their
gender, in their skin -- if we take the intentional steps
to unlearn these deep-seated biases and create space for people
to be self-determined, and embrace who they are, then we will definitely create a better
world than the one we were born into. 10:18(Applause) 10:25KKM: We want to mark this time in history by leaving evidence of the fact
that we were here. We open up little windows
into our relationship for our community to bear witness, and we do this because we want
to make maps to the future and not monuments to ourselves. Our experience does not invalidate
other peoples' experience, but it should and necessarily does
complicate this idea of what love and marriage
are supposed to be. 10:52TM: OK, now for all the talking, and inspiring, and possibility-modeling we've done, we've been nowhere near perfect. And we've had to hold
a mirror up to ourselves. And I saw that I wasn't
always the best listener, and that my ego got in the way
of our progress as a couple. And I've had to really assess
these deep-seated, sexist ideas that I've had about the value
of a woman's experience in the world. I've had to reevaluate what it means
to be in allyship with my wife. 11:19KKM: And I had to remind myself
of a lot of things, too. What it means to be hard on the issues, but soft on the person. While we were writing this,
we got into a massive fight. 11:30(Laughter) 11:33For so many different reasons, but based on the content about our values
and our lived experiences -- and we were really hurt, you know? Because what we do and how we love
puts ourselves entirely on the line. But even though the fight lasted
over the course of two days -- 11:50(Laughter) 11:52We were able to come back
together to each other, and recommit to ourselves,
to each other and to our marriage. And that really yielded
some of the most passionate parts of what we share with you here today. 12:04TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity, which I think doesn't happen enough. I've had to interrogate masculinity; the toxic privileges that come
with being a man don't define me, but I have to be accountable
for how it shows up in my life every day. I have allowed my wife
to do all of the emotional labor of prying open the lines of communication
when I'd rather clam up and run away. 12:26(Laughter) 12:27I've stripped away emotional support
instead of facing my own vulnerabilities, particularly around the heartbreaking
miscarriage we suffered last year, and I'm sorry for that. Sometimes as men,
we get to take the easy way out. And so my journey as a trans person
is about reimagining masculinity. About creating a manhood
that isn't measured by the power it wields,
by the entitlements afforded to it, or any simulacrum of control
that it can muster, but works in tandem with femininity, and is guided by my spirit. 12:58KKM: Y'all ... 13:00(Applause) 13:04And this has created the space
for my femininity to flourish in a way I had never experienced before. He never is threatened by my sexuality, he never polices what I wear or how I act. I cook but he does way more
of the cleaning than I do. And when we're rushing
to get out of the house and we have so much to handle, he handles everything, so I have time to do my hair and makeup. 13:30(Laughter) 13:32He understands that this is my armor, and he never treats femininity
as though it is frivolous or superficial, and this, and him -- he grows my experience
of gender every single day. 13:44TM: I love to watch her
get dressed in the morning. Watching her in the closet, looking for something comfortable
and colorful, and tight, and safe -- 13:53(Laughter) 13:55But it's challenging to watch her
negotiate her decisions looking for something that's going
to get the least amount of attention, but at the same time be an expression
of the vibrant and sexy woman she is. And all I want to do is celebrate
her for her beauty, and the things that make her
beautiful and special and free, from her long acrylic nails, to her uncompromising black feminism. 14:14(Applause) 14:19KKM: I love you. TM: I love you. 14:20(Laughter) 14:22footnotefootnoteKKM: There are so many queer
and trans people who have come before us, whose stories we will never get to hear. We constantly experience
this retelling of history where we are conspicuously left out. And it's really hard
to not see ourselves there. And so living out loud for us
is about that representation. It's about having possibility models, and having hope that love is part
of our inheritance in this world, too. 14:49TM: The possibility that we are practicing is about reinventing time,
love and institutions. We are creating a future of multiplicity. We are expanding the spectrum
of gender and sexuality, imagining ourselves into existence, imagining a world where gender
is self-determined and not imposed, and where who we are
is a kaleidoscope of possibility without the narrow-minded limitations
masquerading as science or justice. 15:15(Applause) 15:19KKM: And I can't lie: it is really, really hard. It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry with an open heart and a smile on my face. It is really hard to face the injustice
that exists in the world, while still believing in the ability
of people to really change. That takes an enormous amount
of faith and dedication. And beyond that, marriage is hard work. 15:43(Laughter) 15:44Piles of dirty socks on the floor, more boring sports shows
than I ever thought possible -- 15:51(Laughter) 15:52And fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we're not
speaking the same language. But there is not a day that goes by where I am not so grateful
to be married to this man; where I'm not so grateful for
the possibility of changing minds, and rewarding conversations, and creating a world
where love belongs to us all. 16:11footnotefootnoteI think about our acronym: LGBTQ2SIA. A seemingly endless evolution
of self and a community, but also this really deep desire
not to leave anyone behind. We've learned how to love each other, and we've committed to loving each other
throughout changes to gender and changes in spirit. And we learned this love
in our chat rooms, in our clubs, in our bars
and in our community centers. We've learned how to love
each other for the long haul. 16:44TM &amp; KKM: Thank you. 16:46(Applause)"
3,How Dolly Parton led me to an epiphany,Jad Abumrad,Jun 2020,"How do you end a story? Host of ""Radiolab"" Jad Abumrad tells how his search for an answer led him home to the mountains of Tennessee, where he met an unexpected teacher: Dolly Parton.", (83K),"Transcript (16 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаالعربية中文 (简体)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:05I want to tell you about my search
for purpose as a journalist and how Dolly Parton
helped me figure it out. 00:13So I've been telling audio stories
for about 20 years, first on the radio and then in podcasts. When I started the radio show
""Radiolab"" in 2002, here was the quintessential
story move we would do. We'd bring on somebody -- 00:26(Audio) Steven Strogatz:
It's one of the most hypnotic and spellbinding spectacles in nature, because, you have to keep in mind,
it is absolutely silent. 00:34Jad Abumrad: Like this guy,
mathematician, Steve Strogatz, and he would paint a picture. 00:38SS: Picture it.
There's a riverbank in Thailand, in the remote part of the jungle, you're in a canoe,
slipping down the river. There's no sound of anything, maybe the occasional, you know,
exotic jungle bird or something. 00:50JA: So you're in this imaginary
canoe with Steve, and in the air all around you
are millions of fireflies. And what you see is sort of
a randomized starry-night effect. Because all the fireflies
are blinking at different rates. Which is what you would expect. But according to Steve, in this one place, for reasons no scientist
can fully explain -- 01:10SS: Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. With thousands of lights on
and then off, all in sync. 01:19(Music and electric sounds) 01:26JA: Now it's around this time that I would generally bring in
the beautiful music, as I just did, and you'd start to get that warm feeling. A feeling, that we know from science, kind of localizes in your head and chest and spreads through your body. It's that feeling of wonder. 01:39From 2002 to 2010,
I did hundreds of these stories. Sciency, neurosciency,
very heady, brainy stories that would always resolve
into that feeling of wonder. And I began to see that as my job, to lead people to moments of wonder. What that sounded like was: 01:57(Various voices) ""Huh!"" ""Wow!"" ""Wow!"" ""That's amazing."" ""Whoa!"" ""Wow!"" 02:05JA: But I began to get
kind of tired of these stories. I mean, partially, it was the repetition. I remember there was a day
I was sitting at the computer, making the sound of a neuron. 02:14(Crackling sound) 02:16You know, take some white noise,
chop it up, very easy sound to make. I remember thinking,
""I have made this sound 25 times."" But it was more than that -- there was a familiar path
to these stories. You walk the path of truth,
which is made of science, and you get to wonder. 02:31Now, I love science, don't get me wrong. My parents emigrated
from a war-torn country, came to America, and science for them was, like,
more their identity than anything else, and I inherited that from them. But there was something
about that simple movement from science to wonder that just started to feel wrong to me. Like, is that the only path
a story can take? 02:52Around 2012, I ran into a bunch of different stories
that made me think, ""No."" One story in particular, where we interviewed
a guy who described chemical weapons being used against him
and his fellow villagers in the mountains of Laos. Western scientists went there, measured for chemical weapons,
didn't find any. We interviewed the man about this, he said the scientists were wrong. We said, ""But they tested."" He said, ""I don't care,
I know what happened to me."" And we went back and forth
and back and forth, and make a long story short, the interview ended in tears. I felt ... I felt horrible. Like, hammering at a scientific truth,
when someone has suffered. That wasn't going to heal anything. And maybe I was relying
too much on science to find the truth. And it really did feel, at that moment, that there were a lot
of truths in the room, and we were only looking at one of them. So I thought, ""I've got to get
better at this."" 03:50And so for the next eight years, I committed myself to doing stories
where you heard truths collide. We did stories
about the politics of consent, where you heard the perspective
of survivors and perpetrators whose narratives clashed. We did stories about race, how black men are systematically
eliminated from juries, and yet, the rules that try
and prevent that from happening only make things worse. Stories about counter terrorism,
Guantanamo detainees, stories where everything is disputed, all you can do is struggle
to try and make sense. And this struggle
kind of became the point. I began to think, ""Maybe that's my job."" To lead people to moments of struggle. Here's what that sounded like: 04:26(Various voices) ""But I see -- I, like --"" 04:28""Uh, I --"" (Sighs) 04:29""Well, so, like, huh --"" 04:31""That, I mean, I --"" 04:33""You know -- golly -- I --"" (Sighs) 04:37JA: And that sigh right there, I wanted to hear that sound
in every single story, because that sound
is kind of our current moment, right? We live in a world where truth
is no longer just a set of facts to be captured. It's become a process. It's gone from being a noun
to being a verb. But how do you end that story? Like, what literally kept happening
is we'd be, you know, telling a story, cruising along,
two viewpoints in conflict, you get to the end and it's just like -- No, let me see. What do I say at the end? Oh, my God. What do you -- how do you end that story? You can't just happily-ever-after it, because that doesn't feel real. At the same time, if you just leave people
in that stuck place, like, ""Why did I just listen to that?"" Like, it felt like there had to be
another move there. Had to be a way beyond the struggle. 05:25And this is what brings me to Dolly. Or Saint Dolly, as we like
to call her in the South. I want to tell you about one little
glimmer of an epiphany that I had, doing a nine-part series
called ""Dolly Parton's America"" last year. It was a bit of a departure for me, but I just had this intuition
that Dolly could help me figure out this ending problem. 05:46And here was the basic intuition: You go to a Dolly concert, you see men in trucker hats
standing next to men in drag, Democrats standing next to Republicans, women holding hands, every different kind of person
smashed together. All of these people that we are told
should hate each other are there singing together. She somehow carved out
this unique space in America, and I wanted to know, how did she do that? 06:08So I interviewed Dolly 12 times,
two separate continents. She started every interview this way: 06:14(Audio) Dolly Parton: Ask me
whatever you ask me, and I'm going to tell you
what I want you to hear. 06:19(Laughter) 06:20JA: She is undeniably a force of nature. But the problem that I ran into is that I had chosen
a conceit for this series that my soul had trouble with. Dolly sings a lot about the South. If you go through her discography, you will hear song after song
about Tennessee. 06:37(Music) DP: (Singing, various songs)
Tennessee, Tennessee... Tennessee homesick ... I've got those Tennessee homesick blues
runnin' through my head. Tennessee. 06:49JA: ""Tennessee Mountain Home,""
""Tennessee Mountain Memories."" Now I grew up in Tennessee, and I felt no nostalgia for that place. I was the scrawny Arab kid who came from the place
that invented suicide bombing. I spent a lot of time in my room. When I left Nashville, I left. 07:08I remember being at Dollywood, standing in front of a replica,
replica of her Tennessee Mountain Home. People all around me were crying. This is a set. Why are you crying? I couldn't understand
why they were so emotional, especially given
my relationship to the South. And I started to honestly have
panic attacks about this. ""Am I not the right person
for this project?"" 07:31But then ... twist of fate. We meet this guy, Bryan Seaver, Dolly's nephew and bodyguard. And on a whim, he drives
producer Shima Oliaee and I out of Dollywood, round the back side of the mountains, up the mountains 20 minutes, down a narrow dirt road, through giant wooden gates
that look right out of ""Game of Thrones,"" and into the actual
Tennessee Mountain Home. But the real place. Valhalla. The real Tennessee Mountain Home. 08:01And I'm going to score
this part with Wagner, because you've got to understand, in Tennessee lore, this is like hallowed ground,
the Tennessee Mountain Home. 08:09So I remember standing
there, on the grass, next to the Pigeon River, butterflies doing loopty loops in the air, and I had my own moment of wonder. Dolly's Tennessee Mountain Home looks exactly like my dad's home
in the mountains of Lebanon. 08:26Her house looks just like
the place that he left. And that simple bit of layering
led me to have a conversation with him that I'd never had before, about the pain he felt leaving his home. And how he hears that in Dolly's music. Then I had a conversation with Dolly
where she described her songs as migration music. Even that classic song, ""Tennessee Mountain Home,""
if you listen to it -- 08:49(Dolly Parton ""Tennessee Mountain Home"") ""Sittin' on the front porch
on a summer afternoon In a straight-backed chair on two legs, leaned against the wall."" 09:05It's about trying to capture a moment
that you know is already gone. But if you can paint it, vividly, maybe you can freeze it in place,
almost like in resin, trapped between past and present. That is the immigrant experience. 09:21And that simple thought
led me to a million conversations. I started talking to musicologists
about country music as a whole. This genre that I've always felt so having nothing to do
with where I came from is actually made up of instruments
and musical styles that came directly from the Middle East. In fact, there were trade routes
that ran from what is now Lebanon right up into the mountains
of East Tennessee. 09:45I can honestly say, standing there,
looking at her home, was the first time I felt
like I'm a Tennessean. That is honestly true. 09:54And this wasn't a one-time thing, I mean, over and over again, she would force me
beyond the simple categories I had constructed for the world. I remember talking with her
about her seven-year partnership with Porter Wagoner. 1967, she joins his band,
he is the biggest thing in country music, she is a backup singer, a nobody. Within a short time, she gets huge, he gets jealous, he then sues her for three million dollars when she tries to leave. Now it would be really easy
to see Porter Wagoner as, like, a type: classic,
patriarchal jackass, trying to hold her back. But any time I would suggest that to her, like, come on. 10:32(Audio) This is a guy, I mean,
you see it in the videos too, he's got his arm around you. There's a power thing happening, for sure. 10:41DP: Well, it's more complicated than that. I mean, just think about it. He had had this show for years, he didn't need me to have his hit show. He wasn't expecting me
to be all that I was, either. I was a serious entertainer,
he didn't know that. He didn't know how many dreams I had. 11:00JA: In effect, she kept telling me, ""Don't bring your stupid way
of seeing the world into my story, because that's not what it was. Yeah, there was power,
but that's not all there was. You can't summarize this."" 11:13Alright, just to zoom out. What do I make of this? Well, I think there's something in here
that's a clue, a way forward. As journalists, we love difference. We love to fetishize difference. But increasingly, in this confusing world, we need to be the bridge
between those differences. But how do you do that? 11:31I think for me, now, the answer is simple. You interrogate those differences, you hold them for as long as you can, until, like up on that mountain, something happens, something reveals itself. Story cannot end in difference. It's got to end in revelation. 11:50And coming back
from that trip on the mountain, a friend of mine gave me a book
that gave this whole idea a name. In psychotherapy,
there's this idea called the third, which essentially goes like this. Typically, we think of ourselves
as these autonomous units. I do something to you,
you do something to me. But according to this theory,
when two people come together and really commit to seeing each other, in that mutual act of recognition, they actually make something new. A new entity that is their relationship. You can think of Dolly's concerts
as sort of a cultural third space. The way she sees all the different
parts of her audience, the way they see her, creates the spiritual
architecture of that space. 12:33And I think now that is my calling. That as a journalist, as a storyteller, as just an American, living in a country struggling to hold, that every story I tell
has got to find the third. That place where the things
we hold as different resolve themselves into something new. 12:55Thank you."
3,Why I photograph the quiet moments of grief and loss,Caroline Catlin,Mar 2021,"The only thing as powerful as our grief is the love we have for those we've lost, says photographer Caroline Catlin. In this meditation on the intersection of life and death, Catlin shares how her personal journey with loss drove her to capture the elusive moments of grace and beauty that exist even in the hardest moments imaginable.", (41K),"Transcript (11 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeالعربيةภาษาไทย한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01You know those awkward icebreaker games, when everyone goes around
and answers something like, ""What's your favorite superpower?"" When I was a kid, I loved those games. I believed I had the perfect answer. People would start sharing
and I would wait, bouncing in my seat with excitement. And when it was my turn, I would proudly tell everyone,
""The superpower I want most of all is to see people's emotions in color,
hovering in the air around them."" Wouldn't it be cool if you could see
how happy a friend was to see you, like they'd walk in and it would
just fill with the color yellow. Or you could tell
when a stranger needed help. You'd pass them on the street and you'd see this long trail
of blue behind them. This was usually the moment where I would look around
at the many blank faces telling me yet again, my cool superpower, it hadn't landed well
with my fellow fourth graders. 01:02I was an awkward child. That hasn't really changed. And neither has my deep appreciation
for the emotional world around me or my desire to both witness and capture
the elusiveness of feelings. As I grew older, I started paying attention to the people
and the stories I came across and I wrote down what I saw. When writing didn't feel like enough,
I learned photography and I began documenting the moments
that felt most precious to me. With a camera in hand, I learned the art of deciding
what to include in the frame and what to let blur into the background. I graduated high school.
I went to college. I studied a combination
of psychology and art. No shortage of feelings there,
I can assure you. 01:52And then ... I got sick. Not in a dramatic way. I didn't start screaming in agony or wake up unable to move
or suddenly forget how to speak. Eventually, all those things
would happen to some degree, but my path from wellness to illness was a slow, persistent movement
towards deep sickness. I spent three years
trying to identify the cause. I met with numerous doctors
and the answer was always the same. There was nothing wrong with me. Over and over. Despite my persistent low-grade fever
and joint pain and muscle aches, I was told, ""Go see a therapist, practice more self-care."" I started to believe they were right. Maybe nothing was wrong. Every test that came back normal had me falling further
into a hole of self-doubt. 02:51I started grad school hoping that I would somehow
get over this mysterious illness and I could return to life
as it was before. Still there was a small,
unwavering part of me that knew. Despite my symptoms not lining up
with anything that made sense, I knew something was wrong. Eventually my cognitive symptoms worsened. Brain fog and memory loss
and word-finding, and a doctor agreed to order an MRI. Assuring me they didn't think
they'd find anything concerning. Instead ... they found a golf ball-sized mass
in my right parietal lobe. And just like that, everything changed. I called my parents and I scheduled a date for brain surgery, and I dropped out of my grad program. They told me the tumor is probably benign and with its removal
that I'd likely make a full recovery. 03:54I wish with all of my heart I could tell you they were right. I wish the story ended here. Six days after surgery,
the pathology report came back telling us the tumor was not benign. It was something called
an anaplastic astrocytoma and while the surgery had been successful
and the tumor was gone, the microscopic cancerous cells
it left behind remained, impossible to remove. In other words, I was
officially diagnosed with a rare, aggressive, incurable brain cancer. Not my best day. 04:38My cancer is treatable,
but it's highly recurrent. And when it does recur,
it tends to return as terminal. The timeline of when, it's unpredictable. Some people get 15 years. Some people just get one. My doctors explained to me that while chemo and radiation
would reduce the likelihood of recurrence, every three months
for the rest of my life, I would need to return to the hospital
to check for new tumor growth. 05:14As I listened, I met real grief
for the first time. I thought of that superpower
I'd once wanted and I imagined a deep dark purple
filling the room around us. A cloak of color that I knew
was going to stay with me. I'm 27. I thought to myself,
how can this be happening? I was as determined as I was devastated. I wanted to fight and recover and I wanted as many years
of life as possible. As I once again
began to regain my strength, I started to pay attention to the people
and the stories around me. In the hospital, I would push
my walker down the hallway and I would steal glances
into the rooms I'd passed and I would see these tiny worlds
contained within them. Sometimes I could feel joy so big, I just wanted to stop and stand in it. Other times, the despair and the sadness
made me want to run. 06:24About three months
after I left the hospital I found out about an organization that offers free photo sessions to critically ill children
and their families. Right away I called them. I set up a meeting
and I signed up to volunteer. Despite my radiation-induced fatigue
and my persistent grief, the idea of giving back in that way, it lit a spark within me
that had been recently extinguished. For the first time in a while, I felt hope. It was as if a thin strand of gold had begun to weave its way
through my coat of grief. And the color was blending
slowly into something new. 07:08This organization offers their services to children at any stage
of serious illness. And often they are joy-filled
and they're celebratory. Other times a family
asks for a photographer to document a child
at the end of their life. Sometimes these are
the only professional photos a family will ever have of their child. Often they're the last ones ever taken. 07:37The first call I got was for an end-of-life session
for a three-year-old girl who'd been very sick for a long time. ""She might pass while you're there,"" they warned me. ""Are you sure you're up for it?"" ""Yes,"" I told them,
completely unsure if I was. Now, I could tell you
about this little girl's death, which happened a few days
after I photographed her. I could, but I'm not going to. Instead, I want to show you
the little girl's mother. How she kissed and stroked
the hair of her daughter as she lay in that too big hospital bed. Even as the world
as she knew it ended forever, she was there to give
love to her daughter. I want you to see
the dying girl's older brother. How he cried, but also how he took his yellow airplane and he flew it above her head. How I saw then a gesture of hope, colorful emotion, orange and gold. I want to bring you with me into the rooms where the mothers hold their babies
and the families say goodbye. And I want to offer you the chance
to see in frames, to choose the point of focus
and blur the background, to see the details we so often miss,
the moments of grace and beauty we assume don't exist
in those desperate places. In the hardest moments imaginable, those families, they choose to love, despite and because of it all. I was not raised in religion and yet I can tell you,
whatever you believe, those rooms are holy ground. 09:41When I was first diagnosed, I was certain grief would swallow me whole and some days I still think it might. I will never be at peace with the fact I might not get to be a mother. That I might not see
my brothers get married, that I probably won't become old, like really old, the kind of old everyone else dreads
and tries to fight against. I would've made a great old person. My grief -- it's big. My fear of dying,
of leaving behind the people I love. It's enormous. And my work photographing death
has not erased that. Death itself is rarely beautiful and the images I capture reflect that too. The grief I have seen,
the immensity of the loss -- it's brutal. 10:41But when I walk into those rooms
with that camera, my job is to do what
I always wanted to do as a child. To capture the feeling
and the connection and the emotion right there in front of me. And what I've learned
from all these families and from my own wild terrain of grief is if I pay close enough attention, I don't need to see emotion
in color after all. It's there and it's visible
in the details. In the way our communities love each other
through anything and everything. And with my camera, I can capture the evidence
of that forever, and I can give it back to them to keep. 11:26Right now, my cancer is stable. I am so glad that for now, I get to keep living. Because that's the other side. My fear of dying, the pain of loss, it's only as strong
as how much I love this life and the people in it with me. None of us are ever ready
to say goodbye to the ones we love. Loss is devastating and try as we might, we can't avoid that shattering grief
that follows in its wake. My guess is no matter who you are
or what you've experienced so far, you already knew this. You too have grieved and all of us will grieve again. And when that happens,
we will have a right to be angry. We can mourn as loudly
as we want, and we should. 12:28But when the worst happens,
we have a choice. You don't have to stay deep
in the dark bitterness of loss and let that be the only thing
that we see or feel. Because the one thing that's as strong
and as powerful as our grief is our love for those who we have lost. And that love will remain like thousands of bright,
colorful strands, woven forever through our cloak of grief, beautiful and awful, side by side, and ours to keep. 13:11Thank you."
3,How to preserve your private life in the age of social media,Bryce Dallas Howard,Jun 2022,"Growing up in the public eye, multi-hyphenate creator Bryce Dallas Howard experienced the familiar pressure to share her life with the world on social media. But with her mother's steadfast guidance, Howard learned to set personal boundaries and savor the beauty of private moments. In this personal talk, she draws on three generations of family wisdom to remind us that ""a private life makes a public life worth living.""", (52K),"Transcript (17 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:00In 2016, I filmed
an episode of ""Black Mirror"" called ""Nosedive."" It's about a woman named Lacie
who lives in a futuristic world where everyone rates
your social interactions. And for anyone who hasn't seen it,
a little spoiler. I basically have a nervous breakdown,
trying really hard to get liked. 00:26For many, the episode
felt a little too familiar. Until recently, only a small fraction
of the human population lived their lives publicly. And while we haven’t entered
the “Black Mirror” world yet, we’ve entered a new era. Everyone has access to a global audience. We all live in public. Some more willingly than others. There's pressure to share
more of ourselves than we want. We often feel we have no other choice. To be relevant. To fit in. To get ahead. To be trusted and liked.
Accepted and understood. 01:13This new compulsion toward self-exposure is possibly the biggest
social experiment in history. We're making life-altering decisions
about our personal boundaries with no guidance and no precedent. Fortunately, there is a blueprint. Anyone who's lived in the public eye as an athlete,
a politician or an entertainer has navigated a version of this. 01:46My dad has been a public figure
since he was five years old, as an actor, a child actor,
and later as a director. And I've been an actor
since my early twenties. In fact, my family has been
in the business of entertainment for three generations, contending with how to handle
putting ourselves out there for the last 70 years. My mom, Cheryl, never wanted
to be in the public eye. She just happened to love a man who is. 02:17My mom met my dad, Ron, when they were 16. And by that point
she had flown solo in an airplane, joined an all-boys gun club, gotten in tons of fist fights and helped her single dad
raise her younger sisters. This is to say, my mom was
a passionate, busy young person who initially ignored the attention
of the famous boy in her high school. It was the early 70s, and my dad was known for playing Opie
in the ""Andy Griffith Show,"" and he'd soon film a pilot
for a new show called ""Happy Days."" Much of this was lost on my mom. The only thing she watched
on TV was ""Star Trek."" 03:01(Applause) 03:02(Laughter) 03:03It's true. After they finally joined forces, after he actually proposed three times, and had kids, my mom transformed
into a full-on warrior woman, ready to protect. But it wasn't until I was given a movie script at preschool as a way to get it to my dad ... 03:29(Laughter) 03:31that my mom realized his visibility
was extending to the entire family, and that she would need
to prepare us for something she herself had never experienced. Growing up in the public eye. And this entailed
some extreme parenting tactics. First. No coddling, like ever. As a kid, I was terrified of snakes, so my mom got me a pet snake. 04:00(Laughter) 04:02When I blanked at my first piano recital
and ran offstage crying, my mom insisted
I stay and support my peers. Years later, when my son
grimaced at a chipmunk carcass, our cat had left in the driveway, Cheryl made him clean up the remains. 04:22(Laughter) 04:24My mom wanted to toughen us up so we'd have more courage and less fear when dealing with
uncomfortable situations. So that meant zero coddling. Put your comfort away, she'd preach. Any challenge that arose
was an opportunity to find your sea legs. Next up, confidence comes from character, not our looks. Cheryl was a giant buzzkill. When she noticed me
glancing in the mirror as a kid, she decided to nip that
in the bud immediately by covering up
all the mirrors in the house. 05:11(Laughter) 05:14A loving compliment was,
""You have wonderful character,"" not ""You're beautiful."" Oh, and character was built
by doing chores. 05:26(Laughter) 05:27When I wasn't mucking out the goat barn,
I was shearing sheep, changing tires, scrubbing toilets,
volunteering, shoveling snow. Cheryl believed that hard work, particularly in service of others, breeds confidence, a trait we need more and more of when exposing ourselves
to any kind of public attention. 05:50But perhaps the most important lesson was: a private life makes
a public life worth living. Cheryl saw that while fame
came with many blessings, there was an impact and a potential cost
to living your life in public. And so more than anything, she,
like my grandparents before her, emphasized the value of privacy. Because cultivating
a private life is precious. It's sacred. Its value is inherent
in what you don't share. What you withhold. And for whom. 06:35The world is now one big small town. But within that virtual town square,
there are tiers of relationships, degrees of intimacy, and everyone deserves
a different amount of you, a different side. 06:52Now, where those boundaries lie is up to you. But in order to make those decisions, we must all be our own Cheryl, our own protectors. Because it's tempting to think
that the more I share, the more ways you have to connect with me. But there's a specialness in knowing that whatever I share with my husband
or my kids or my best friend is just for them and no one else. Without that inner circle,
we're left with shallowness and a void. We're known, but never truly known,
even to ourselves. 07:33Living in public
asks us to be brave and bold, but preserving a private life
empowers us to take those chances. So when my 15-year-old son
started a YouTube channel and my 10-year-old daughter
asked to join TikTok, I asked myself, ""What would Cheryl do?"" As much as I want to protect my kids, I know encouraging them to opt out
is not the answer. So I don't want my kids
in the digital fray until they know who they are. But you develop your sense of self
by participating in the world. So I try to help them discover themselves
through these technologies, not despite them. 08:19And I give myself that same protection
and motherly advice by honoring two main principles. The two day delay. So whatever I'm experiencing, I try to wait 48 hours
before posting and sharing because that way I can be present
in private with the people I love before calculating how
I'm going to publicly position it. And post with purpose. Before I share, I ask myself:
Why? What's the purpose? And most importantly,
how does it serve the people I love? 08:58The dangers and opportunities
of living a life in public existed, honestly,
way longer before any of this. But it's important to know
what my family knew then and knows now. That your true value is measured
by the richness of your private life. The piece of you that only a select few, or perhaps only you, has access to. Because the legacy we create in private is as powerful and lasting
as any public accolade. Perhaps even more so. 09:41Thank you so much. 09:42(Applause)"
3,How to discover your authentic self — at any age,Bevy Smith,May 2022,"In a talk packed with wry wisdom, pop culture queen Bevy Smith shares hard-earned lessons about authenticity, confidence, mature success and why, if you put in the work, ""life gets greater later.""", (92K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishFrançaisItalianoMagyarTiếng Việtעברית中文 (简体)FootnotesFootnotes00:00I am a late bloomer. In fact, a friend of mine
you may have heard of -- Chris Rock -- he once called me the most
late-blooming mofo he’d ever met. 00:12(Laughter) 00:13Now, some people
might consider that snide, but I revel in it. I’m 55, and I’m here in this curvy body
as someone who has done the work, lived the life walked the walk
in these very high heels -- 00:29(Laughter) 00:30and therefore is qualified
to testify in the church and in the court of law that it does, in fact, get greater later. 00:38(Applause and cheers) 00:44Now coming to this
realization wasn’t easy. At the age of 38, I was a very successful
fashion advertising executive, and I was really living
what most people considered a dream life. I was jet-setting to fashion shows; I was receiving free designer clothes; I was double-kissing
my way across the globe. 01:02(Laughter) 01:03I was. And, you know, it was everything
that I ever wanted it to be, and then one day I realized
I was only pretending to be happy. But I couldn’t blow up my good life
in my prime earning years, right? Wrong. Which leads me to lessons
my mother Lolly taught me. 01:24Lolly’s number one lesson: don’t settle. Don’t settle. Now I’m aware that my
well-paying, glamorous career is not exactly the humdrum,
“I hate my job” stereotype that most people equate with settling. But it was a settle for me, because when I actually did
quit my job at the age of 38, it was with the intention
that every day be a great adventure. Now sometimes it was
a very scary adventure, like being broke from the age of 40 to 45. But even still, I wouldn’t trade that
for the safe and settled version, because if I had, I would not
be here with y’all today. 02:03(Applause and cheers) 02:04Yeah. So you know how when you like,
buck the system and go against the status quo, it makes people really uncomfortable? And invariably, people will ask, “Where do you get your confidence?” 02:20(Laughter) 02:22Now some people mean it as a compliment, but very often it’s shady ... 02:29(Laughter) 02:30footnotefootnoteand it's a silent judgment. And to those people, I respond with a quote from this Brooklyn
poet you may have heard of, Jay-Z. 02:38(Laughter) 02:39“She get it from her mama.” I am she, and my mama is the epitome
of a grown-ass woman: someone who has always
been very comfortable in her skin. In 1965, my mom was 37 years old. She already had one child, my big brother, Gerry, and she married my dad,
but she kept her maiden name. And then she had my sister
Stephanie and I back-to-back, but she continued to work because she refused to be
beholden to my dad for money. And I bet my mom was the only woman
in our neighborhood who cooked once a week. She made Sunday dinner. It was an extravaganza, but that’s all she did. She cooked one day a week. 03:21My mom is just amazing. And she also had this ability
of talking to her children about real life and making sure that we understood
the virtues of going your own way, which is why I believe
today at the age of 94, and a recent widow, my mom is still carving out ways to find and determine and define
her own version of happiness. She cooks for herself. She maintains her home
exactly as she sees fit. She enjoys champagne and R-rated films. 03:55(Laughter) 03:56(Applause) 03:59My mom has managed
to maintain her glamour, her sex appeal, you know, her independence. And I really hope
some of that rubs off on me. 04:09You know, recently I’ve been
thinking about one of the best lessons that my mom ever taught me, which is the literal beauty in aging. Now, we all know
that Black don’t crack, right? OK... Black don’t crack. So at the age of 50, my mom could have
easily passed for the age of 35. And you know, that’s back
during the time when people -- women were really coy about their age. “Oh, a lady never tells her age.” My mom never subscribed to that. She was always proud of her age. As a matter of fact, she believes you may not tell your age, but your hands and your neck will. 04:49(Laughter) 04:50So make peace with aging, or prepare for an entire wardrobe
of gloves and turtlenecks. 04:56(Laughter) 05:00Yeah, my mom has always done
these wonderful things like that, but I wish she could rub off on everyone because I feel like now I’m looking
at even 20-somethings who have a fear of aging. I watch them on social media, like, you know, compulsively practiclng
the latest 10-second dance craze, and it feels like their angsty and asking, “Is that all there is?” And I just want to yell, “Yes, that is all there is
if all you’re going to do is settle for dancing to someone
else’s TikTok beat!” 05:30(Laughter) 05:31(Applause and cheers) 05:33Settling is very insidious. It keeps us dancing on this string, waiting for this elusive, better day
to miraculously appear. Now thanks to Lolly’s tutelage,
that’s not my story. In fact, I take each day as it comes but I try to make it better than the last. 05:51So, you know, I’m single ... but I’m always ready to mingle. 05:56(Laughter) 05:58I’m an entrepreneur, but I keep multiple revenue streams. I’m a solo traveler, which means I’ve done the sepia version
of “Eat, Pray, Love” on six continents. Because I don’t settle. What that means is that I also
don’t second-guess my decisions, and I’m also not worried about my future because I’m firmly rooted in the present. Settling is a really sinister thing. It will keep you up at night
tossing and turning, trying to figure out why and trying to answer that age-old question
of “Is that all there is?” Personally, I don’t have time for that, because the only time I want to be
kept up all night long tossing and turning is when I’m in the company
of a fine-ass man. 06:44(Laughter) 06:45(Applause and cheers) 06:47That's it. 06:48(Applause) 06:50I wish I could tell you guys that I learned all these valuable
lessons from Lolly and they were instilled in me
and it was great, but alas, I am a late bloomer
in all regards. So I had to learn a couple of lessons
from the era of Bitchy Bevy. What kind of person
has 10 assistants in five years? Bitchy Bevy, that’s who. 07:15(Laughter) 07:16Now I didn’t start out my career
with a toxic attitude. No, initially I was really happy
to be in the fashion industry. You know, but then I began
to compare my trajectory to others, and I also began to feel burned out because I was burdened
by these personas that I had created that were allegedly going to help me
progress in my career. I made a couple of mistakes. One, I thought that being snarky
was a good career move. It wasn’t. I also thought I look good
in the color brown. I actually don’t. 07:43(Laughter) 07:44Yeah. 07:45(Laughter) 07:48And, you know, I just -- in my dream montage, I wanted to get away from Bitchy Bevy. I wanted to get away from the color brown. And so in the movie version of my life, as soon as I quit my job, I’m a yoga guru. I’m extremely limber and very happy. Come to think of it though, guys, I’m actually limber and happy right now. But I would be lying -- and I believe it is against
international law to lie during a TED Talk -- 08:17(Laughter) 08:18so I’m not going to do that. And as a matter of fact, my insecurities
popped back up as late as last year. I was minding my business,
as one does, perusing social media, and I saw people excelling in a space where I, you know,
traditionally had a lot of success. So I’m looking at it and I’m like, “Well, why the hell
they ain’t call me for that job?” And I have this, like, angst, and then I realize
they didn’t call me for that job because you already said
you didn’t want that job. You told the universe
you weren’t into working like that. You don’t want a job -- I really don’t. 08:53(Laughter) 08:54I’m not into it. So... that’s why it happened. And what I realize is that intellectually
I had grown and evolved, but emotionally ... I was Tom Petty and I was living in “Petticoat Junction.” 09:10(Laughter) 09:12I told y’all that brown
doesn’t look good on me; petty looks even worse. It’s not my shade. And so what I wound up
having to do was really get a grip. I had to assess a few things about myself, and I decided to do
a little self-help ritual called ... “Take a note, give a note.” It’s easy. When you see someone having something
that you believe you deserve, you take a note. You ask yourself a few questions. Is it something that you really want? Perhaps that person is better suited
than you are for that. Does the universe -- is the universe conspiring
for you to have that? Really kind of try and be honest
with who you are and where you’re at in life. Once you do that, you take
a deep breath -- 09:56(Inhales) 09:57and you say, “Their wins
have nothing to do with my worthiness.” And then you’re ready to give a note. You go on social media, and you say congratulations. Or my personal favorite, you pick up the phone,
like it’s the 20th century, and you say, “Congratulations, kudos, you did that, Al! You go, girl!” You do all the things. Instantly you feel
like a better human being because you have actually extended grace. You’ve extended grace. You’ve extended grace to someone else. And I believe that when you remove
malice from your heart, not only do you feel better,
you look better. I think you lose your frown lines
and your wrinkles lessen and your age spots disappear. I believe it’s better than Botox, extending grace. I do. 10:47(Applause) 10:49Yeah. No, but let me get back
to the note thing. So one of my favorite notes
is from Willie Shakespeare. “To thine own self be true.” Now we’ve all read self-help books, and the first line of defense
is always “Be your most authentic self.” And I believe in that. I believe that nobody can be you but you, so you might as well show up and show out. But here’s the quandary
that the bard never put forth. What if you don’t really know who you are
because you suppressed your inner self? You’ve suppressed the core of you. You’ve suppressed the best parts of you because you took on these other
identities and these personas in an effort to make your life better. Because, you know, we all
buy into some things about what we’re supposed to be doing
and who we’re supposed to be. So what if you squelch that? Because I know I had to excavate
to dig up a Little Brown Bevy. But the way I found her
was with three questions. Who am I at my core? How am I being perceived? How would I like to be perceived? 11:55Who am I at my core? At my core I’m looking
to authentically connect with people. I don't like a cursory,
you know, interaction, and I do not believe in networking. I like an authentic connection. I’m also curious and I’m adventurous and I’m kind and I’ve got big dreams. 12:13How am I being perceived? Well, y’all know
the nickname, Bitchy Bevy ... so, duh. But here’s the problem. There’s a lot of power in that persona, and I actually really enjoyed it
for a time, you know, because you can make
a lot of money being a bitch, especially in fashion. 12:29(Laughter) 12:31But it’s also incredibly
lonely and isolating, and I didn’t want to live
that life anymore. And so I decided to change my life. And I left all of that alone. I really did, like, just change my spirit. And leaving fashion obviously helped. And when I did that, all of a sudden, I let
Little Brown Bevy out to play. 12:53Little Brown Bevy. I love her so much. Little Brown Bevy is a nerdy girl, and so I let my nerdy pursuits
come out to play. I must have joined every museum
on Museum Mile in New York City. I began to travel the world just to look at architecture
I had always dreamed of. I learned how to be alone
without being lonely. My spirit shifted. I became a better person. You can ask people -- I became a better person. 13:21And now I get to stand here
in front of you guys with no bravado, with nothing to prove, I tell you, with nothing to prove. I’m not trying to prove nothing to y’all. 13:31(Laughter) 13:32(Applause) 13:34(Cheers and applause) 13:36Thank you. 13:37(Applause and cheers) 13:39I have an open heart. And I can’t even believe that Little Brown Bevy
from 150th Street and Eighth Avenue, from the hamlet of Harlem, is now an award-winning radio and TV host, an author, an actress, a creative consultant. I would do all those things for free. But here’s the thing. I ain’t cheap,
and I’m definitely not free, so don't get any ideas. 14:04(Laughter) 14:05(Applause) 14:07But I am here in this
“Mama I made it” moment as someone who can show up
as her most Bevyest self because I’ve done the work. Yeah, my most Bevyest self. So, you know, I’m going to show up -- some of you’ve met me -- you know I’m vibrant
and boisterous, AKA loud. OK, you know that I’m going to show up, and I’ve got a pep in my high heel,
red-bottom step. I do have heaving cleavage. 14:36(Laughter) 14:37And I’ve got a tell-it-like-it-is
approach to life that’s always dosed with a ladle of love. 14:44It took me 55 years to get here. So, Chris Rock, you’re right. I’m a late bloomer. And that’s OK. Because I’m right on time, Because it gets greater later. 14:57Thank you. 14:58(Applause and cheers)"
3,A strategy for supporting and listening to others,Jeremy Brewer,Dec 2020,"As a police officer, Jeremy Brewer interacts with individuals experiencing trauma and loss on a daily basis. Giving us a peek into this little-discussed aspect of the job, Brewer shares thoughtful insights on why respecting people's space is sometimes more important than trying to fix an unfixable moment -- and explains how you can use this approach to support someone when they need you the most.", (49K),"Transcript (13 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSvenskaРусскийالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01I'm not sure what you might think when you think about
the job of a police officer. Recent events have sparked lots of debate
over the role of law enforcement in our society and if it should change. And that's a big, important conversation
that we all need have. But today I'd like to talk about something that's at the core
to my day-to-day work -- something not often discussed
when talking about police work, and that's dealing
with trauma, hurt and loss. 00:30What's it like to tell someone -- someone that they know, someone that they love died suddenly? Many of you might think
this is done by hospitals or doctors. If you die there, well, it usually is. If you die outside the hospital, it's more often than not the police
who notify that nearest loved one. Doing that type of work
has taught me powerful lessons on approaching highly charged situations
in all areas of my life. 00:59My passion to connect
started about 10 years ago. I responded to a death call
that changed me. A woman -- let's call her Vicky. Vicky called because her husband
had suddenly collapsed in the hallway of their home. The first responders and I
tried everything. We gave it our best effort, but he died. 01:21In complete devastation, Vicky fell to the floor. Instantly, I could feel us
strapping on that emotional armor, going right to work
on policies and procedures. I began peppering her with questions
like detailed medical history and funeral home arrangements. Questions that she couldn't possibly
have been prepared to answer. In an empathetic gesture, I reached down and I put
my hand on her shoulder. She flinched and pulled away. Suddenly, her neighbor came running in and instantly hugged her. Vicky pushed her away too. The neighbor seemed stunned, a little put off, and she walked back out. Then, to make matters worse, the medical examiner's office, carrying the body bag holding her husband, dropped it down a flight of stairs, crashing into a decorative end table. 02:21I will never forget the sound of her voice when she looked at me and said, ""I wish I never called."" I felt awful. 02:32Being confronted with death
can be difficult for everyone. Often we rely solely
on our instincts to help guide us. In law enforcement, we tend to put up an emotional shield, a barrier to emotions. That way we can focus
on policies and procedures to guide us. This is why we can sometimes
come across as robotic. 02:54I've discovered
that in the civilian world, you're often driven
by that instinct to fix it, usually done with well-intended
comments or physical touch. Sometimes that may be that right answer. Other times, not. Had I slowed down and just taken a breath, I would have been better able
to connect to the humanity of that moment. I could have avoided that policy
and procedure, check-the-box mentality. Her neighbor, had she slowed down, just taken a breath, she may have been able to see
that in that moment, Vicky just wasn't prepared for touch. Our hearts may have been
in the right place, but we made it about us
instead of focusing on her. 03:42In complete contrast, more recently, I met a woman -- let's call her Monica. I was tasked to tell Monica that her husband had tragically
taken his own life. She fell to the floor crying so hard
she could barely breathe. The gravity of that moment was so strong, but I knew I needed to resist
that urge to move in and to comfort her. That sounds crazy, right? Honestly, it's excruciating. In your mind and in your heart,
you just want to hug this person. But I stopped myself. 04:16Having been around trauma
for over 20 years, I will tell you not everybody is comfortable
with human touch. There are people all over the world suffering from physical
or psychological trauma you may know nothing about. Who knows what they're thinking
or feeling in those moments. If I move in, if I touch her like I did Vicky, I could unintentionally
revictimize her all over again. Think: respect space. Be guided by respect space. It's a simple concept with a huge impact. You can't step into that space
until you're invited. 04:57So I sat across from Monica, silent, eye level, just feeling that moment. My heart was pounding
so hard I could hear it. That lump in my throat? Ugh, I -- I could barely swallow. And you know what? That's OK. Emotions and vulnerability
can be so hard for some people. I understand that. But in human moments, people want human. They don't want a robotic police officer
or to be talking about paperwork. They just want another human
to connect to them. As we sat together, she asked me one question
over and over and over again. ""What am I supposed to tell my kids?"" One of the most important parts
of respecting space is not always having to have an answer. I could feel she didn't want me
to answer that question. She didn't want me to try to fix
that unfixable moment. She wanted me to connect
to the depth of that experience she was going through. 06:01Yes, I had a job to do. And when the time was right, I asked the questions
that needed to be answered, but I did it at her pace. 06:10Responding to death calls has taught me
so much about the human experience and the best ways to be there for somebody
when they need you the most. But it doesn't always have to be
when dealing with death. There's never a bad time
to build a connection. Hearing a private
revelation from a friend, you could be such a better listener. In an argument with a loved one, by just stepping back
and giving that respect space, you could better connect
to their side of an issue. You may never be asked
to tell a complete stranger that their loved one died, but we all have the opportunity to be the best, most connected
versions of ourselves, especially in times of need. That respect space
that you provide another can have a life-changing effect
on the people around you. 06:59Thank you."
3,How to connect with depressed friends,Bill Bernat,Mar 2018,Want to connect with a depressed friend but not sure how to relate to them? Comedian and storyteller Bill Bernat has a few suggestions. Learn some dos and don'ts for talking to people living with depression -- and handle your next conversation with grace and maybe a bit of humor., (58K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00The one conversation that uplifted me
more than any other in my life was with a woman who told me how, a few days earlier, she drove her Jeep Wrangler
to the edge of the Grand Canyon and sat there, revving the engine, thinking about driving over. Even though I had severe social anxiety, in that conversation,
I was totally at ease. 00:26(Laughter) 00:27She told me what was going on in her life in the days and months leading up, what her thoughts were
at that exact moment, why she wanted to die, and why she didn't do it. We nodded and half-smiled, and then it was my turn
to talk about my journey to a dining table
in the hygienic community area of the mental health wing
of a mountain-town hospital. I took too many sleeping pills, and after they treated me for that, they were like, ""Hey, we would love it
if you would be our guest in the psych ward."" 01:03(Laughter) 01:08We joked that her suicide
would have made a way better postcard. 01:13(Laughter) 01:14We talked shop. 01:16(Laughter) 01:17She allowed me to be deeply depressed and have a genuine connection
to another person, simultaneously. For the first time, I identified as somebody
living with depression, and I felt good about it -- like I wasn't a bad person for it. 01:34Now imagine one of the people
at that table was a member of your family or a close friend. Would you be comfortable talking to them? What if instead of the hospital, they were at your kitchen table and told you they were really depressed? 01:50The World Health Organization says that depression is the leading cause
of ill health and disability worldwide, affecting 350 million people. The National Institute of Mental Health reports seven percent of Americans
experiencing depression in a year. So depression is super common, yet in my experience, most folks don't want
to talk to depressed people unless we pretend to be happy. A cheerful facade is appropriate
for casual interactions. A depressed person can ask for extra syrup
in their pumpkin spice latte without explaining that they need it because they're trapped
in the infinite darkness of their soul and they've lost all hope of escape -- 02:37(Laughter) 02:39again. 02:40(Laughter) 02:43Depression doesn't diminish
a person's desire to connect with other people, just their ability. So in spite of what you might think, talking to friends and family
living with depression can be really easy and maybe even fun. Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga-
at-an-underground-party fun -- I'm talking about the kind of fun where people enjoy
each other's company effortlessly. Nobody feels awkward, and no one accuses the sad person
of ruining the holidays. 03:18Why does this chasm even exist? On the one side, you have people living with depression who may act in off-putting
or confusing ways because they're fighting
a war in their head that nobody else can see. On the other side, the vast majority of people
look across the chasm and shake their heads, like, ""Why you gotta be so depressed?"" 03:44You may recognize
a divide like this in your life. Do you want to build a bridge across it? You may not want to build a bridge -- and that's a totally valid choice. Or maybe you'd like to build
a stronger connection, but you have a lot
of questions and concerns. You're what I might call ""bridge curious."" 04:08(Laughter) 04:12Here are some possible reasons why some of you
may avoid depressed people. You might be afraid that if you talk to somebody
while they're depressed, you're suddenly responsible
for their well-being. You're not expected to be Dr. Phil. Just be friendly -- more like Ellen. 04:31(Laughter) 04:35You may worry that you won't
know what to say, and every attempt
at conversation will be awkward, and the only time you'll feel comfortable is when you both just give up on talking and stare at your phones. Words are not the most important
thing to focus on. You might fear seeing your shadow. Hey, if you have been
successfully outrunning your personal emotional demons, that's awesome. May the wind be at your back. 05:10(Laughter) 05:11You can be the least
woo-woo person in the world and still connect with depressed people. Maybe you've heard
that depression is contagious, and you're afraid of catching it. Bring some hand sanitizer. 05:25(Laughter) 05:26You're much more likely to catch
the joy of human bonding. 05:31Maybe you see
depressed people differently. You think of them as flawed or defective. Multiple university studies have shown that A students are more likely
to have bipolar condition. Our brains aren't broken or damaged, they just work differently. I spent a lot of years thinking
happy people just don't get it. 05:57(Laughter) 05:58I did eventually stop
discriminating against happy people -- 06:02(Laughter) 06:06I began battling depression
when I was eight, and decades later, to my surprise, I started winning. I shifted from being miserable
much of the time to enjoying life. I live pretty well
with my bipolar condition, and I've overcome some other
mental health conditions like overeating, addiction
and social anxiety. So I live on both sides of this chasm. And I'm offering some guidance based on my experience to help you build a bridge across it if you want to. It's not hard science, but I worked with a lot people
I know who've lived with depression to refine these suggestions. 06:54First up, some things
you might want to avoid -- some ""don'ts."" One of the most off-putting
things you can say is, ""Just get over it."" Great idea -- love it, it's just we already thought of that. 07:09(Laughter) 07:16The absence of the ability
to just get over it is depression. 07:20(Laughter) 07:24(Applause) 07:29We feel it in our bodies -- it's a physical thing for us. And medically it's no different from telling someone
with a broken ankle or cancer, ""just get over it."" Don't be hell-bent on fixing us. Like, thank you, but ... the pressure can make us depressed people
feel like we're disappointing you. Also, things that make
some people feel better may not work for us. You can't cure clinical depression
by getting ice cream ... which is unfortunate, because
that would be living the dream. 08:09(Laughter) 08:13Don't take a negative response personally. So, I have a friend who, about a year ago, messaged me that he was really
isolated and depressed. And I suggested some things for him to do, and he was like, ""No, no and no."" And I got mad, like, how dare he not embrace
my brilliant wisdom? 08:36(Laughter) 08:38And then I remembered
times I've been depressed, and how I thought I was doomed
in all possible futures, or everybody suddenly hated me,
and things like that. It didn't matter how many people
told me otherwise -- I didn't believe them. So I let my friend know I cared, and I didn't take it personally. 09:03Don't let a lack of bubbly
happiness freak you out. It's not a shark attack. ""Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!"" 09:14(Laughter) 09:16We can be sad and OK at the same time. I'm going to say that again, because in our society,
we're taught the opposite, and so it's counterintuitive. People can be sad and OK at the same time. 09:33So some of these things may apply
to you personally, some may not. Take what's useful. And remember, you don't have to connect. If you want to, here are some suggestions that may help -- some ""dos."" Talk to us in your natural voice, right? 09:52(Laughter) 09:54You don't need to put on a sad voice
because we're depressed -- you don't sneeze when you're talking
to somebody with a cold. 10:03(Laughter) 10:06It's not rude to be upbeat. You can be you, OK? If you make an offer to be there for us, clearly state what you can and can't do. I have told people,
""Hey, call or text any time, but I might not be able
to get back to you that same day."" It's totally cool to not make an offer, or to make a narrow offer
with really clear boundaries around it. Give us a sense of control. Like, get our consent. I have a friend who, a while back, when I was having a depressive episode, reached out and said,
""Hey, I want to check in with you. Can I call you every day? Maybe text you every day
and call later in the week? What works for you?"" By getting my permission,
she earned my complete confidence and remains one of my best friends today. And my last suggestion is: interact about not depression, aka, normal stuff. I have a friend who,
when people were worried about him, they would call and ask
if he wanted to go shopping or help them clean out their garage. Your depressed friends
could be a good source of free labor -- 11:22(Laughter) 11:32What I'm really getting at is, invite them to contribute
to your life in some way, even if it's as small
as asking you to go see a movie that you wanted to see in the theater. 11:47So that's a lot
of dos and don'ts and maybes, and it's not by any means
a definitive list. The thing to remember
is that they're all grounded in one guiding principle. It's what allowed the woman
in the Jeep Wrangler to start me on the path to recovery
without even trying. She talked to me like I belonged and contributed exactly as I was
at that moment. If you talk to a depressed person
as if their life is just as valuable, intense and beautiful as yours, then there's no need
to build a bridge between you, because you've closed the chasm. Focus on that instead of your words, and it may be the most uplifting
conversation of their life. What could that do
for somebody you care about? What could it do for you? 12:51Thank you. 12:52(Applause)"

of my personal and professional identity that I'm so nice
and able to get along with anyone, even my most fierce opponents. It's like my ""thing,""
it's what I'm known for. 00:21(Laughter) 00:24But what no one knows ... is that I was a bully. Honestly, I didn't think
about it much myself. I buried the memories for years, and even still, a lot of it's really hazy. Denial, by the way, apparently
is also one of my things. 00:44(Laughter) 00:46But the more people started to praise me for being a liberal who could
get along with conservatives, and the more I wrote articles
about being nice and gave talks about being nice, the more I felt this hypocrisy
creeping up inside me. What if I was actually really mean? 01:07When I was 10 years old, there was a girl in my class
at school named Vicky. 01:15(Sigh) 01:16And I tormented her ... mercilessly. I mean, everyone did. Even the teachers picked on her. It doesn't make it any better, does it? Vicky was clearly a troubled kid. She would hit herself
and give herself bloody noses and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems. But instead of helping this girl, who was plainly suffering
from hardships in her life ... we called her ""Sticky Vicky."" I called her ""Sticky Vicky."" 01:56My clearest memory
is standing in the empty hallway outside the fifth grade classrooms waiting for Vicky
to come out of the bathroom, and I have a clipboard and a pen
and a survey I've made up, asking about shampoo preferences, like I'm doing a study
for science class or something. And when Vicky comes out of the bathroom, I pounce on her and I ask her
what shampoo she uses. Now, to put this in perspective, I can't remember the names of my teachers, I can't remember the names
of any of the books I read that year, I pretty much can't remember
anything from fifth grade, but I remember that Vicky told me
she used White Rain shampoo. Clear as yesterday, like it just happened. And as classes let out, I ran down the hall shouting
at all the other kids, ""Sticky Vicky uses White Rain shampoo. Don't use White Rain shampoo or you'll smell like Sticky Vicky."" 02:50I forgot about this memory
for a long time. When I finally started remembering it, I immediately needed to know more. I reached out to friends
and eventually social media, and I did everything I could
to try to find Vicky. I needed to know that she was OK, and that I hadn't ruined her life. 03:07(Sigh) 03:08But what I quickly realized was I wasn't just trying to figure out
what happened to Vicky. I was trying to figure out
what happened to me. 03:17When I was 10 years old, I treated another human being
like some worthless other ... like I was better than her, and she was garbage. What kind of a nice person does that? I mean, I know I was only a kid, but not all kids do that. Most kids don't do that, right? So, what if I wasn't nice after all? I was really just a hateful monster. 03:45Then I started to notice myself
having these mean impulses, thinking mean thoughts and wanting to say them. Admittedly, most of my mean thoughts
were about conservatives. 03:59(Laughter) 04:04But not just conservatives. I also caught myself thinking mean things
about mushy, centrist liberals and greedy Wall Street bankers and Islamophobes and slow drivers, because I really hate slow drivers. 04:16(Laughter) 04:19And as I'd catch myself
in these moments of hypocrisy, either I was just noticing them
or they were getting worse, especially in the last few years. And as I felt more hateful -- rageful, really -- I noticed the world around me
seemed to be getting more hateful, too. Like there was this steady
undercurrent of hate bubbling up all around us and increasingly overflowing. 04:43So the plus side, I guess, is that I realized that hate
was not just my problem, which is like, the most
selfish plus side ever -- 04:54(Laughter) 04:56because now instead of just my own hate
and cruelty to try to figure out, I had a whole world of hate
I wanted to unravel and understand and fix. 05:10So I did what all overly intellectual
people do when they have a problem that they want to understand, and I wrote a book. 05:18(Laughter) 05:21I wrote a book about hate. Spoiler alert: I'm against it. 05:26(Laughter) 05:29Now at this point,
you might be thinking to yourself, ""Why are y'all worried about hate? You didn't hate Vicky. Bullying isn't hate."" Isn't it? 05:41Gordon Allport, the psychologist who pioneered
the study of hate in the early 1900s, developed what he called
a ""scale of prejudice."" At one end are things like genocide
and other bias-motivated violence. But at the other end are things like believing
that your in-group is inherently superior to some out-group, or avoiding social interaction
with those others. Isn't that all hate? I mean, it wasn't an accident that I was a rich kid
picking on a poor kid, or that Vicky, it turns out,
would eventually end up being gay. Poor kids and gay kids
are more likely to be bullied, even by kids who also end up being gay. I know there was a lot going on
in my little 10-year-old mind. I'm not saying hate was the only
reason I picked on Vicky or even that I was consciously
hateful or anything, but the fact is, the people we discriminate against
in our public policies and in our culture are also the groups of people
most likely to be bullied in school. That is not just a coincidence. That's hate. 07:03I am defining hate in a broad way because I think we have a big problem. And we need to solve all of it,
not just the most extremes. So for instance, we probably all agree
that marching down the street, chanting about you should take away
rights from some group of people because of their skin color
or their gender, we'd all agree that's hate, right? OK. What if you believe
that group of people is inferior, but you don't say it? Is that hate? Or what if you believe
that group of people is inferior but you aren't aware
that you believe it -- what's known as implicit bias. Is that hate? I mean they all have
the same roots, don't they? In the historic patterns
of racism and sexism that have shaped our history
and still infect our society today. Isn't it all hate? 07:58I'm not saying they're the same thing, just like I am not saying that being a bully
is as bad as being a Nazi, just like I'm not saying that being a Nazi
is the same thing as punching a Nazi ... 08:10(Laughter) 08:16But hating a Nazi is still hate, right? What about hating someone
who isn't as enlightened as you? See, what I learned is that we all are against hate and we all think hate is a problem. We think it's their problem, not our problem. They're hateful. I mean, if I think the people
who didn't vote like me are stupid racist monsters who don't
deserve to call themselves Americans, alright, fine, I'm not being nice, I get it. 08:49(Laughter) 08:51I'm not hateful, I'm just right, right? 08:54(Laughter) 08:56Wrong. We all hate. And I do not mean that
in some abstract, generic sense. I mean all of us ... me and you. That sanctimonious pedestal of superiority
on which we all place ourselves, that they are hateful and we are not, is a manifestation
of the essential root of hate: that we are fundamentally good
and they are not, which is what needs to change. 09:33So in trying to understand and solve hate, I read every book
and every research study I could find, but I also went and talked
to some former Nazis and some former terrorists and some former genocidal killers, because I figured if they could
figure out how to escape hate, surely the rest of us could. 09:55Let me give you just one example
of the former terrorist I spent time with in the West Bank. When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old, he tried to blow up an Israeli
military convoy with a grenade. He failed, fortunately, but he was still sentenced
to seven years in prison. When he was in prison,
they showed a film about the Holocaust. Up until that point, Bassam had thought the Holocaust
was mostly a myth. He went to go watch the film because he thought he would enjoy
seeing Jews get killed. But when he saw what really happened,
he broke down crying. And eventually, after prison, Bassam went on to get
a master's degree in Holocaust studies and he founded an organization
where former Palestinian combatants and Israeli combatants come together, work together, try to find common ground. By his own account,
Bassam used to hate Israelis, but through knowing Israelis
and learning their stories and working together for peace, he overcame his hate. Bassam says he still
doesn't hate Israelis, even after the Israeli military -- shot and killed his [10]-year-old
daughter, Abir, while she was walking to school. 11:20(Sigh) 11:22Bassam even forgave the soldier
who killed his daughter. That soldier, he taught me, was just a product
of the same hateful system as he was. 11:39If a former terrorist ... if a terrorist can learn to stop hating and still not hate
when their child is killed, surely the rest of us can stop our habits of demeaning and dehumanizing each other. And I will tell you there are stories
like Bassam's all over the world, plus study after study after study that says, no, we are neither designed
nor destined as human beings to hate, but rather taught to hate
by the world around us. I promise you, none of us pops out of the womb
hating black people or Republicans. There is nothing in our DNA
that makes us hate Muslims or Mexicans. For better or for worse, we are all a product
of the culture around us. And the good news is, we're also the ones
who shape that culture, which means we can change it. 12:36The first step is starting to recognize
the hate inside ourselves. We need to catch ourselves and our hateful thoughts
in all their forms in all of us ... and work to challenge
our ideas and assumptions. That doesn't happen overnight, I am telling you right here, it is a lifelong journey,
but it's one we all need to take. 12:58And then second: if we want to challenge
the hate in our societies, we need to promote policies
and institutions and practices that connect us as communities. Literally, like integrated
neighborhoods and schools. That by the way is the reason
to support integration. Not just because
it's the right thing to do, but because integration
systematically combats hate. There are studies
that teenagers who participate in racially integrated classes
and activities reduce their racial bias. And when little kids go to racially
integrated kindergartens and elementary schools -- they develop less bias to begin with. But the fact is in so many ways
and in so many places around our world, we are separated from each other. In the United States, for instance, three-quarters of white people
don't have any non-white friends. 13:52So in addition to promoting
those proactive solutions, the other thing we need to do
is upend the hate in our institutions and our policies that perpetuate dehumanization
and difference and otherizing and hate, like systems of sexual harassment
and sexual assault in the workplace, or our deeply racially imbalanced and deeply racially biased
criminal ""justice"" system. We need to change that. Again, it will not happen overnight. It needs to happen. 14:29And then ... when we connect together in these connection spaces, facilitated by connection systems, we need to change the way
we talk to each other and connect with one another and relate with generosity
and open-mindedness and kindness and compassion and not hate. And that's it. That's it. 15:00(Applause) 15:04I have solved it all, right? That's it. That is pretty much -- there's a few details -- but that's pretty much all we have to do. It's not that complicated, right? But it's hard. The hate that we feel
towards certain groups of people because of who they are
or what they believe is so ingrained in our minds
and in our society that it can feel inevitable and impossible to change. Change is possible. Just look at the terrorist
who became a peace activist. Or look at the bully who learned
to apologize to her victim. 15:55The entire time I was traveling
around the Middle East and Rwanda and across the United States, hearing these unbelievable stories
of people in communities who had left entire histories
of hate behind, I was still looking for Vicky. It was so hard find her that I hired
a private investigator and he found her. I mean, he sort of found her. The truth is, it became clear
that the person I'm calling Vicky had gone to extraordinary lengths
to hide her identity. But anyway, a year after
I began my journey, I wrote Vicky an apology. And a few months later, she wrote back. 16:42(Sigh) 16:45I'm not going to lie, I wanted to be forgiven. I wasn't. 16:54(Sigh) 16:55She offered me sort of
conditional forgiveness. What she wrote was ... ""Messages such as yours
cannot absolve you of your past actions. The only way to do that
is to improve the world, prevent others
from behaving in similar ways and foster compassion."" And Vicky's right. Which is why I'm here. 17:23Thank you. 17:24(Applause)"
3,How working couples can best support each other,Jennifer Petriglieri,Nov 2020,It's possible to have a successful career AND a successful marriage. Professor and author Jennifer Petriglieri explains how you and your partner can make choices that work for your life together -- without sacrificing your individual aspirations., (9.9K),"Transcript (27 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTagalogTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Translate @ TED, TranslatorCamille Martínez, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00It may sound strange to bring up work, but when we fall in love, we often consider
what that love will do to our life, and our work and careers
are a big part of that. 00:11[The Way We Work] 00:12[Made possible with
the support of Dropbox] 00:14All working couples face hard choices, and these can feel like a zero-sum game. One partner gets offered
a job in another city, so the other needs to leave
their job and start over. One partner takes on more childcare
and puts their career on hold so the other can pursue
an exciting promotion. One gains and one loses. And while some couples who make
these choices are satisfied, others regret them bitterly. What makes the difference? 00:42I've spent the last seven years
studying working couples, and I've found that it's not
what couples choose, it's how they choose. Of course, we can't control
our circumstances, nor do we have limitless choices. But for those we do, how can couples choose well? 00:59First: start early, long before
you have something to decide. The moment you're faced
with a hard choice, say, whether one of you
should go back to school or take a risky job offer, it's too late. Choosing well begins with understanding
each other's aspirations early on -- aspirations like wanting
to start a small business, live close to extended family, save enough money
to buy a house of our own or have another child. 01:24Many of us measure our lives
by comparing what we're doing with our aspirations. When the gap is small, we feel content. When it's large, we feel unhappy. And if we're part of a couple, we place at least some of that blame
with our partner. 01:40Set aside time at least twice a year to discuss your aspirations. I'm a big fan of keeping a written record
of these conversations. Putting pen to paper with our partners helps us remember each other's aspirations and that we're writing
the story of our lives together. 01:56Next: eliminate options that don't support the life
you want to live together. You can do this agreeing on boundaries
that make hard choices easier. Boundaries like geography:
Where would you like to live and work? Time: How many working hours a week
will make family life possible? Travel: How much work travel
can you really stand? Once you've agreed to your boundaries,
the choice becomes easy when faced with an opportunity
that falls outside of them. ""I'm not going to interview for that job, because we've agreed we don't
want to move across country."" Or, ""I'm going to cut back on my overtime because we've agreed it's essential
we spend more time together as a family."" 02:35Couples who understand
each other's aspirations and commit to strong boundaries can let go of seemingly attractive
opportunities without regret. If you're faced with an opportunity
that falls within your boundaries, then what matters is
that the choices you make keep your couple in balance over time, even if they don't perfectly align
with both partners' aspirations at the same time. 02:59If your choices are mainly
driven by one partner or support one partner's aspirations
more than the other, an imbalance of power will develop. That imbalance, I've found, is the reason most
working couples who fail do so. Eventually, one gets fed up
with being a prop rather than a partner. 03:19To avoid this, track your decisions over time. Unlike your aspirations and boundaries, there's no need to keep a detailed record
of every decision you make. Just keep an open conversation going
about how able each of you feel to shape decisions that affect you both. 03:36How will you know you've chosen well? One common misunderstanding is that you can only know
what choice is right in hindsight. And maybe it's true
we judge life backwards, but we must live it forwards. I've found that couples
who look back on a choice as a good one did so not just because
of the outcome eventually; they did it because that choice empowered
them individually and as a couple as they made it. It wasn't what they chose, it was that they were
choosing deliberately, and that made them feel
closer and freer together."
3,The money talk that every couple needs to have,Wendy De La Rosa,Jan 2021,"When it comes to talking about money with your significant other, most of us ... just don't. But the fact is, if you share a life, you need to discuss your finances now, says behavioral scientist Wendy De La Rosa. She explains why and shares 3 tips to get you started.", (17K),"Transcript (16 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийالعربيةکوردی سۆرانی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)FootnotesFootnotes00:00You know how your partner
likes their coffee, what love language they speak and even their medical history. But how much do you know
about their finances? 00:08[Your Money and Your Mind
with Wendy De La Rosa] 00:12Chances are, you and your better half
are among the 78 percent of people who would rather share
their full dating history and all of that drama and all of that baggage
that comes along with it, rather than to disclose
your full financial history. And yet research shows
that your significant other has a large influence on a
whole host of your behaviors. Understanding how they handle money is a great way to prevent strife
and misunderstandings. In fact, financial disagreements rank
as the strongest predictor of divorce. So my tip here is that if you want
to strengthen your relationship, it's time to talk about the money. 00:49You might be thinking,
""My partner and I don't need to talk. My partner takes care of
the money,"" or vice versa. But a 2018 study of heterosexual couples
shows that in these situations, the partner who takes on
all of the responsibility, the one who manages
all of the financial tasks, they become more and more proficient
at financial management over time. But the other person, the person who has given up
all of their financial responsibilities, their financial management
capabilities decline over time. And what if something happens? Maybe you break up,
maybe it doesn't work out, or, God forbid, maybe
your spouse dies too early. If the person who wasn't responsible
for the money management ends up on their own, that person oftentimes struggles
to regain their financial skills, making it more and more difficult for them to navigate the world alone. And 75 percent of the time, it's the women who outlive the men. 01:41For the partner who hasn't taken on
the money management role, it's like forgetting a foreign language: when you stop using it, you lose some of your ability
to understand and communicate in it. But if you keep that
financial immersion going, so does your fluency. Being open about your finances
can be very scary, but it can also be very rewarding. Experiments have shown
that shared vulnerability establishes a greater
sense of trust, cooperation and intimacy in relationships. 02:09So to get you started, I, along with a couple of colleagues, developed a list
of 10 conversation starters. Here are just three. Number one: What are your long-term financial goals? What do you want to accomplish together? Number two: How do you measure your financial success? Is it a house with a white picket fence, or is it having the ability to live
anywhere around the globe? Number three: What's the one thing you wish your parents
would have done differently financially? As a university study found, it's important to answer
these questions together because joint decision-making, making decisions as a couple, oftentimes results in taking fewer risks that in turn can lead to higher savings. 02:49Now, I'm sure you intuitively understand that open, honest conversations
with your better half are beneficial. And I understand that it's
difficult to get started, especially when talking about money. But a great first step
is just to put some time on the calendar so that you two can have
a nice financial chat. Take out your phone right now, set the calendar invite. Your future self will thank you."
3,Love — you're doing it wrong,Yann Dall'Aglio,Feb 2014,"In this delightful talk, philosopher Yann Dall'Aglio explores the universal search for tenderness and connection in a world that's ever more focused on the individual.

It's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application. I can love jogging. I can love a book, a movie. I can love escalopes. I can love my wife. (Laughter) 00:23But there's a great difference between an escalope and my wife, for instance. That is, if I value the escalope, the escalope, on the other hand, 
it doesn't value me back. Whereas my wife, she calls me the star of her life. (Laughter) 00:48Therefore, only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. I know this, that's why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired. Hence the eternal problem of love: how to become and remain desirable? 01:10The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules. You had a specific part to play according to your sex, your age, your social status, and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community. Think about the young woman
who must remain chaste before marriage. Think about the youngest son 
who must obey the eldest son, who in turn must obey the patriarch. 01:45But a phenomenon started in the 13th century, mainly in the Renaissance, in the West, that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind. This phenomenon is modernity. We can basically summarize it
through a triple process. First, a process of rationalization
of scientific research, which has accelerated technical progress. Next, a process of political democratization, which has fostered individual rights. And finally, a process of rationalization 
of economic production and of trade liberalization. 02:31These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies, with radical consequences for the individual. Now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude, any choice, any object. But as a result, they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. In other words, my value was once ensured by submitting myself 
to the traditional authorities. Now it is quoted in the stock exchange. 03:21On the free market of individual desires, I negotiate my value every day. Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. He is obsessed: ""Am I desirable? How desirable? How many people are going to love me?"" And how does he respond to this anxiety? Well, by hysterically collecting
symbols of desirability. (Laughter) 03:55I call this act of collecting, along with others, seduction capital. Indeed, our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital. It is said about this consumption
that our age is materialistic. But it's not true! We only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds. We do it to make them love us, to seduce them. Nothing could be less materialistic, 
or more sentimental, than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees, because he wants to please Jennifer. (Laughter) Consumerism is not materialism. It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love, or rather in the name of seduction capital. 04:52In light of this observation on contemporary love, how can we think of love in the years to come? We can envision two hypotheses: The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic 
capitalization will intensify. It is hard to say what shape 
this intensification will take, because it largely depends on social and technical innovations, which are by definition difficult to predict. But we can, for instance, imagine a dating website which, a bit like those loyalty points programs, uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age, 
my height/weight ratio, my degree, my salary, or the number of clicks on my profile. We can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment. 06:00By the way, there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. These teachers call themselves ""pick-up artists."" ""Artist"" in French is easy, it means ""artiste."" ""Pick-up"" is to pick someone up, but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks. So they are artists of picking up chicks. (Laughter) And they call heartache ""one-itis."" In English, ""itis"" is a suffix that signifies infection. One-itis can be translated as ""an infection from one."" It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists, falling in love with someone is a waste of time, it's squandering your seduction capital, so it must be eliminated like a disease, like an infection. We can also envision a romantic use of the genome. Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. (Laughter) 07:22Of course, this race for seduction, like every fierce competition, will create huge disparities 
in narcissistic satisfaction, and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too. So we can expect that modernity itself, which is the origin of seduction capital,
would be called into question. I'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo-fascist or religious communes. But such a future doesn't have to be. 07:58Another path to thinking about love may be possible. But how? How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued? Well, by becoming aware
of my uselessness. (Laughter) Yes, I'm useless. But rest assured: so are you. (Laughter) (Applause) 08:29We are all useless. This uselessness is easily demonstrated, because in order to be valued I need another to desire me, which shows that I do not have any value of my own. I don't have any inherent value. We all pretend to have an idol; we all pretend to be an idol for
someone else, but actually we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street who appears totally cool and indifferent, while he has actually anticipated and calculated so that all eyes are on him. 09:09I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships. It is because I want to be loved from head to toe, justified in my every choice, that the seduction hysteria exists. And therefore I want to seem perfect so that another can love me. I want them to be perfect so that I can be reassured of my value. It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up, just like that, at the slightest underachievement. 09:42In contrast to this attitude, I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness. What is tenderness? To be tender is to accept 
the loved one's weaknesses. It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies. (Laughter) That's pretty bad. On the contrary, there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness. I refer specifically to a kind of humor
that is unfortunately underused. It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness. 10:12I refer to self-mockery. For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported by the constraints of tradition, I believe that self-mockery is one of the best means for 
the relationship to endure."

of having to break it down into parts so that they become manageable. We have despair. We have anxiety, exhaustion,
sadness, anger, irritability. All these feelings are part of stress. And when they are named and framed, we can better regulate them
and deal with them. Prolonged uncertainty at this moment
is that notion that we are uncertain, but we also don't know
how long this will last. This is not your typical disaster where you have a warning and a planning and an onslaught and a post. We are in it and we
don't know for how long. We experience a sense of ambiguous loss
where things are gone but still there, and it really prevents
a sense of mourning. Buildings are standing. They are physically present,
the office buildings, but they are emotionally hollow. Family members are in nursing homes
or in other countries. They are emotionally, psychologically
very, very close to us, but they are physically absent. 01:59And that sense of ambiguous loss
is most exemplified in what we are experiencing at this moment as the loss of Eros. And the pandemic gripped the world. And then the pendulum that swings
between freedom and security has snapped off its hinge. There is a constant, extreme
emphasis on safety and it cordons off. We avoid the spaces where we can
experience happenstance, chance encounters, mystery, surprise, all those elements of Eros
that create a sense of aliveness and vibrancy in our lives. That is the place where creativity
and curiosity also meet. 02:47So what are some of the things
that people can do once we understand stress in this way is to create routines
and rituals and boundaries. Routines to separate
the different activities, the different roles
and responsibilities that we inhabit, rituals because they create
sacred time and sacred space and boundaries, because they
create delineation, demarcation, borders, and those are really necessary for us to experience a sense
of groundedness and structure. 03:22And the second thing
that really helps with stress as well is actually to create space for Eros. There's a reason people at this moment
are seeing plants grow, seeing bread rise, creating things,
making things out of nothing. Because when you see life
emerge in front of you or something change in front of you, it functions as an antidote
to deadness and to stress. 03:49HW: It's true. I can't tell you how many
of my friends have adopted puppies in this time. Everyone's a dog owner. 03:57EP: You know, we usually thrive on this casual sharing
of personal stories with coworkers or going to a place for lunch that we hadn't gone to
and wanted to explore or talking to a kind stranger
on the commute. All of these enlivening
moments of our lives, surprise moments of our lives,
are currently not there. So the puppy, it really gives us
all of that, you know, a pet amongst us. So not just any pet, you know,
an animal, a child. Those are natural sources
of surprise and mystery and spontaneity. They bring the Eros right in front of us. 04:34HW: I love that because I think
it's such a good analysis of where we are and what we've all been experiencing. I think the flip side of this almost is there's basically
no such thing as control. Right? And so I'm curious, you know, for those of us who used to have a life that we understood in some ways -- so we had the office, we had the home,
we had these places where we could go and we kind of understood
how the world was structured -- with the collapse of those roles
and the collapse of those boundaries, how do you regain a sense of yourself
in this new world and what are your tips
for kind of establishing the boundaries, like these new boundaries? 05:17EP: We are not working from home, we are working with home and we are sometimes sitting on one chair. I was doing a session for ""How's Work?"" with a newsroom, and one of the people was talking
about how she has a new baby. She sits at home, she's nursing. She's the mother. She's the colleague. She's the manager. She's the reporter. She's the spouse. She's the daughter of. She's the friend. She has all those roles coming together, merged in one place, ever without having to leave
her dining room table. And the mute button
is basically her only boundary left between one world and the other. So what has she lost? She lost the sense of community, of collective support
that she gets at work, the ability to commiserate. She lost being a woman who is a mother
who goes to work and is a working mother because now she's actually working
and mothering at the same time, the whole day in the same place. That's a very different experience. 06:21And for her and every
working parent at this moment, it is essential to communicate
boundaries with partners. We were talking yesterday --
and with colleagues as well. We were talking yesterday. Your child came into the room
and basically you notified, I am home, I am alone,
my son is here and he may show up. And indeed he did. And there is something very different when we don't try to hide
our multiple realities, but we actually integrate them in the midst of the situations
that we are in. 06:54Carving out a special sacred space, physical space
to delineate the separations, I think at this point
is extremely important. That involves, you know,
even changing clothes. We are usually very localized people and we change, we move to another place. We have a ritual of preparing
the things that we need to put in our bag, to go to the gym, to go to the restaurant,
to go to see friends or family. None of these markers are currently there to give us that embodied sense
of experience. We are exhausted, basically. We use the word a lot, but we don't always attribute exactly
where that exhaustion is coming from and it comes from the loss
of these delineations and demarcations, these boundaries that are
very, very grounding to us. 07:45HW: I don't know if you saw that video
of the dad who was on telly with the BBC and his kid came in
and then another kid came in. He kind of strong-armed
the kid out of the way. And I think what's beautiful about this
is that we have, you know, I think that we are all learning
how to roll with this. And, you know, now my son
will come and join a meeting and everyone's just like waves
and is like, ""Hi Jack,"" and, you know, and then he gets bored
and wanders off again. And that's kind of, you know, in a way,
I think that's a really beautiful outcome. I mean, it's a very lucky outcome because I'm very lucky
to be able to work at home and have that kind of
fortunate aspect of my life. But I just think it's a beautiful outcome. 08:24EP: But you know,
what's also very striking is that you're not trying to hide it and to whisk him away. In a way I think, you know,
we are integrating your home life, your reality as a mother
alone at home with your child who is also working
as part of our conversation. And I think that this for me reflects
a very interesting change in this moment, which is a kind of an anti-small talk. You know, people are literally
speaking about the things that they usually try
to keep outside of the office door. We usually bring our whole self to work. Right now, we are bringing
our whole work to our personal world and that merging is creating a very different
set of conversations as well. And those conversations
are part of the collective resilience that helps us deal
with the loss of control, the prolonged uncertainty and all the other stressors
that we mentioned. 09:21HW: So how does this affect
our ability to feel productive? I'm curious about that feeling of, like -- at the end of the day
I just did a really -- I nailed that project,
so I did that really well. And I feel really good about that. I'm going to close the door and I'm going
to leave and I'm going to go home again. 09:38EP: I'm going to frame this
a little differently. Zygmunt Bauman, the sociologist, basically made this
very, very apt observation. In abnormal circumstances, when people have abnormal responses, that is actually normal. So this notion of wanting
to continue to be how we used to be is one of the things
that we need to release. We -- this is a time
where we try to face our uncertainty by being even more productive. And so we end up working seven days instead of understanding that
what really will help us get through this is a sense of mass mutual reliance, a deep sense of interdependence
that we are in a shared experience and that collectively
we need to go through this. That in itself will help
us remain productive, but not the amount of hours
that we are putting in or the notion that we have
an outcome that is as good as it would have been
if none of this was happening because it is happening. We can't pretend
that none of this is happening. 10:40And I think that when we are able
to acknowledge our reality and then respond accordingly, it actually A -- makes us more productive, B -- makes us less stressful and C -- maintains
our sense of connection, which ultimately is our greatest
source of resilience for dealing with this kind of situation. 10:59HW: What are you hearing from managers
about how they're dealing with this in terms of their people
and their organizations and how are you helping them? 11:08EP: So what I hear from managers are the same stresses
that we've just mentioned, is a new emphasis
on not just on relationships and the importance of relational
intelligence in the workplace, but of mental health and wellness, of an integration
of an entire emotional vocabulary that involves empathy
and trust and psychological safety, at the same time as we are discussing
performance indicators. What I bring to the conversation
is really how do you create these anti-small talk exchanges,
conversations with a team, and every team has
a different culture for that. But it is about helping people, inviting people to talk
about how the big events that are happening
at this point in the world are also manifesting
in their personal lives. 12:01And I give them the example
of my own startup, of EPGM, where we on Friday have literally
shrunken the length of the meeting and have taken a much longer time to check in with each other, about self-care, about the divisions
that take place in our own families, about what have been the resources
that have been most useful. But it has become really a resource pool
that has deepened the connections and that has also fostered the resilience and has had very clear effects
on the productivity. So I shared that with the companies
that I work with and talk about stress and boundaries and communications so that it helps people understand
what they are going through, but particularly that this is
a shared collective experience they're going through and not just something
that is happening to them alone. 12:56Acute stress or pandemics fracture and create divisions because uncertainty leads people to want to confront the loss
of their sense of mastery and certainty. And so it often invites
a kind of polarization about the worldview itself. To create a shared vocabulary
counters all of that. And that is primarily
what I do at this moment when I work with companies or cofounders or managers, is to -- what you were saying before, it's to name it,
to frame it, to distill it, and then to be creative
in how to respond to it. 13:40HW: I'm curious for your thoughts about
what does this mean for the future of work and how we should prepare for it. 13:47EP: Look, there's a lot of discussions
about the future of work that centers on the remote
versus in-person and all of those things. I think for me, what this pandemic
has really taught us is that relational intelligence is not
just a soft skill for the workplace, that mental health is really
at the center at this moment of how we show up at work. Work is a place today where we seek
belonging, purpose, development, and way beyond just
putting food on the table. It is an identity economy. And those fundamental existential needs
that people are bringing in, psychological needs
that people are bringing to work are part of how we are going to redefine
the future of the workplace. 14:34There are tendencies to talk about it
in relation to technology, to AI, and all those things are really important. But because of the technology, because of the AI, because of
all the loss of the human touch, the conversation about
how we maintain humanity, how we maintain social connection, how we allow people to show up -- You know, people always say,
I want to bring my whole self to work. And I say we already do. All the skills
that we cultivate in our lives and in our childhood, growing up, they show up with us at work and this moment has really
made that beyond clear. 15:12HW: Esther Perel, it's always
a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you so much
for sharing your insights with us. 15:17EP: It's a pleasure for me to be here. Thank you."
3,The mood-boosting power of crying,Kathy Mendias,Nov 2020,"Here's a talk about tears -- and why crying isn't something to be afraid or ashamed of. Exploring the science behind the mood-boosting power of crying, childbirth and lactation educator Kathy Mendias shows how tears can enhance your physical and mental well-being and deepen your relationship to yourself and others.", (47K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeالعربية中文 (繁體)한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorKrystian Aparta, Reviewer00:01According to the American
Academy of Ophthalmology, we create 15 to 30 gallons
of tears a year. I am what you would call
a high-volume producer. Now even though we do create
less tears as we age, I figure by the time I'm 80, I will have filled up 40
average-sized bath tubs. 00:19Now crying in my early years? Not something I would brag about. When I was five, I thought it was a good idea
to practice writing my name on the side of the house. Outside the house. Momma didn't agree with me much. She handed me a toothbrush and said, ""Here, scrub."" So I did. I'd sit at the dining room table
for what seemed like an eternity. I didn't want to eat my vegetables. You probably know the feeling. I'd miss all my favorite shows
and cry like crazy. Crying was always associated
with something bad. 00:51Fortunately, I grew up. I stopped writing on the walls,
started eating my vegetables, and I entered the wonderful
world of motherhood. And let me tell you,
crying takes on a whole new meaning. 01:01I was nine months pregnant
and I was sitting on the couch, looking at the front door
where my bags were packed, waiting for me, because I was hopeful
that today would be the day. I settle in a little bit more, and I think to myself, ""You know,
we can put humans into space, but we can't seem to figure out
when a baby will be born."" And then I feel this pressure
build up in my chest, my throat get really tight, and I just burst into tears. 01:27And you know what? I had no idea why. And not knowing why at the time, well, that just got me more upset, so I eventually was just upset
for being upset. I took a deep breath -- (Inhales) and I let it out -- (Exhales) Thought that would help,
but no, it didn't. Then my brother walks in
with his smirky grin and he says to me, ""What's wrong with you?"" I said, ""Nothing, just leave me alone."" And he did, he ran as fast as he could. And you know what I did when he left. I cried even harder. I was ashamed and embarrassed,
just like when I was a kid. 02:03Now lucky for me, I only had to look at that bag
sitting by the front door for another nine days, right before my expected date of delivery. And finally, my body said it was time. And after 18 hours of feeling
my body try to expel this little human that weighed about the size
of a bowling ball, and hours of pushing so hard that I thought for sure
this baby was stuck, within a heartbeat, my beautiful baby girl Jennifer entered the world. And I looked at her, and she cried and then I just cried. All of that emotion and pressure
that I had inside just seconds before was immediately replaced
with the most joyous sense of relief that I had ever felt. 02:53And after nine months of crying
over these fears and anxieties and crazy out-of-control hormones, that was instantaneously
transformed into the deepest, most heartfelt, happiest cry of my life. And I had no control. Those really hard tears, those happy tears, those overwhelming joyful tears, they had nowhere to go but out. And it was those tears, that moment, that incredible high, that inspired me to birth
three more little miracles and start to help others have their own. I became a childbirth educator, and I started a whole new
relationship with tears. 03:39It was early in my 30 years of teaching, I had a class touch my heart
like no other. The topic for the night -- emotions of pregnancy, go figure. And it was important for the class to first learn about the emotional
changes and responses during pregnancy, and how when we cry, it can feel
like the body's trying to push out that extra emotion, almost like it's processing
what it can't hold inside. Like an exhaust port
for extreme feelings of sadness, joy or even relief after days, years of anticipation
of that one magical moment. It can literally feel like your body
is squeezing out all that emotion in the form of water coming from our eyes. Our tears. 04:26Now tears were always expected
during my classes. Not mine this time, the new moms'. And this night in this class, it was way different. I had just finished talking
about the emotional changes of pregnancy and I went in to talk about
the couvade syndrome. Now the word ""couvade""
comes from a French term, ""couver,"" which means ""to brood,"" similar to birds protecting a nest. Well, who better to protect this nest
than the expecting mother's partner? Also called a sympathetic pregnancy, the couvade syndrome
is a real-life phenomenon, where the non-pregnant partner
can take on pregnancy characteristics like mood swings, loss of sleep, weight gain and for some, a really intense drive
to do something new and unexpected, like buy a new sports car or start a new hobby like gourmet cooking. The class usually laughs
a little bit after that and that's it. We end the night. But it didn't end there. 05:28When I finished my sentence, this big, burly father-to-be stands up, and I thought for sure he was leaving. But instead, in a really gruff,
commanding way, he says, ""Alright, you guys, how many of you have cried
during this thing, you know, her pregnancy?"" 05:49I scan the class
to make sure everybody was OK. They were fine, they were just very intent
on what was going to happen next. And then, one gentleman
raises his hand and says, ""I have."" And then another, and the stories just flowed. Even this really quiet gal -- she was the fiancee
of one of the expecting moms -- she looks at her and she says, ""See? I told you
my crying was normal too."" The class connected, they validated each other, and we all walked away with a new respect for the non-pregnant partners that night. For me, that solidified my passion
to embrace those tears. 06:31Then, it got better. On the last night
of that same six-week class, one of the expecting moms came up to me. She asked to talk to me privately,
and I said of course, and we went into the corner. And she says, ""I need to thank you
for saving my relationship."" I let her go on, and she tells me that her husband
was considering leaving her over her mood swings, out-of-control crying, and his turmoil and anger
over this pregnancy. But he didn't leave. She went on to tell me
that they realized now it's OK to cry. And he had told her that when he cries, he doesn't feel as angry. Wow! Not only did crying
bring my class together, it kept that couple together. 07:24And you know, his comment about anger
was really, really intriguing to me, so I looked around, did some research, and sure enough, Dr. Oren Hasson, an evolutionary psychologist, he had some theories
about when tears blur our vision, it really has the ability to, sometimes,
reduce our ability to react to that anger. But the tears weren't the anger. They were more like the release valve. And though many of us,
we try to keep those tears inside, but letting them out
really may be the better move. Keeping them inside can amplify our feelings
of anger or sadness. 08:06And while we're releasing those tears, our hormones inside,
they're on high alert, and we know this because of Dr. William Frey, a biochemist. He found that inside
of our emotional tears -- not our everyday, like, yawning tears, but our emotional tears -- there's high concentrations
of stress hormones and leucine enkephalins, which, easier on my tongue, is endorphins. And while our stress hormones
are helping our bodies out, our endorphins, those feel-good chemicals, they're helping to act as a pain reliever to boost our mood. Now who wouldn't want that? 08:43There are two triggers
for the release of endorphins for most of us. Stress and pain. And for a woman giving birth, experiencing both stress and pain, endorphins, they are a gift. As the labor progresses, those endorphins will rise
to help her with a potentially long labor. As a result, the mom is better able to cope, and she can feel more alert
and almost euphoric after the birth. 09:14Crying is just awesome. I wish there was a bigger word. Crying offers us an opportunity
for physical relief, for intimacy between two individuals and ultimately, it promotes physical
and mental well-being. And as an expression of our most intense
interior human experiences, there is no need to be embarrassed, no need to be ashamed and no need to run away. 09:50We need to have a healthy
relationship with crying and change the way we view tears. We see them as overwhelming
and scary and confusing, when they're really beautiful, soothing and reassuring. They're not to be seen
as some screeching alarm bell that something is wrong but rather a natural functionality of our amazing bodies. 10:18Crying is as essential to me as breathing. And now, if I'm caught crying
on that couch by my wonderful husband, who has had to learn way more
about crying than he ever wanted to, he doesn't run away. He'll ask me why I'm crying, and I'll let him know
I just need my release. He'll take my hand, and you know what I'll do? I will let it all out. And then I'm going to sink
into that deep sense of intimacy and extraordinary sense of relief that only my tears can bring. 11:01Thank you."
3,Love others to love yourself,Keiichiro Hirano,Jul 2018,"Keiichiro Hirano believes authentic self-love starts with being open to knowing all of our ""selves""—whether we like them or not. In his tender talk from TEDxKyoto, Hirano suggests that with the help of our loved ones we can begin to honestly and completely love who we are. (In Japanese with English subtitles).", (5K),"Transcript (4 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançais日本語Reiko Bovee, TranslatorAlessandra Tadiotto, Reviewer00:19As I have been recently hearing
about disturbing sad news, I often think about
the idea of loving yourself. We have been taught to love other people
as an important value, but I think loving our own selves hasn't been considered
to be an issue worth talking about. Why? It may be because it's too obvious, that we love ourselves, to take up the issue
and stress the importance. All of us can't avoid
being egoistic, sometimes. We want to have things our own way. If everything in our life is going well,
can we love ourselves? Not necessarily so. The reason why it's hard
to discuss ""self-love"" may be that it has a kind
of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people. If we saw somebody
looking in the mirror, saying, ""How I love myself! Don't bother me!""... I am not talking about myself! We would want to say, ""Suit yourself!
Keep looking in the mirror."" I want to say it doesn't have
to be like that, to love ourselves. Life isn't always easy. It would be, of course, nice
if we were happy all our life. But in our life, many people
might say, ""I hate you,"" or ""I wish you would disappear
from this world."" Going through the agony, we ultimately reach the realization
that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking
responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves. If, when people tell us, ""I hate you,"" we respond to it by saying,
""Yes, I hate myself, too,"" the moment we said so, I'm sure we would lose our desire
to go on living. I've felt the need
for that kind of attitude more than once myself. Since we don't know
what will happen in the future, the kind of situation in which we have
to love ourselves might arise again, in the sense of needing
to take care of ourselves. It would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life. For a quite long time, I couldn't figure out
what kind of person I was. When I did something good for others, people showed appreciation to me, and then I thought I was basically
a pretty good person. Like that, I had occasions
that made me feel relieved. On the other hand,
when I would really hurt someone, I was very disappointed in myself, feeling like I was fundamentally
a cruel person. To love ourselves actually may be harder
than to love any other person, because we know ourselves thoroughly,
through and through. Looking back at all we have done
in the past, and remembering: ""Boy, I did such things
as this and that..."" And not only the good things we've done, but unpleasant things we've done
also come back at us. Can we love ourselves
with knowing all those sides of us? At this point, I thought,
in our thought process, there must be something
fundamentally wrong. Then, I started by doing
this to change it: First, I honestly looked back at myself, seeing a pretty good person, or one not so good. And for the time being, I accepted all my ""selves,"" good or bad. Instead of being judgmental about myself, thinking ""I may be a nice guy at heart,"" or ""I may be basically a cruel person,""
""Which one is really me?"" I decided to accept all my ""selves""
as parts of myself, and thought about why I had
so many varied ""selves"" in this one person. To sum it up, it's in response to different people
and different situations. When I talk to my grandmother,
I am very relaxed. When I talk to people at work, I may sound serious,
putting on a serious look, talking about difficult things. When I talk to somebody
who rubs me the wrong way, you can bet the tone of my voice
can't be this calm. I try not to come into contact
with such a person in the first place. In any case, each ""self"" of mine
has its own uniqueness. To love each ""self"" of mine equally
in order to love myself may be very difficult, but I can say, ""I love my 'self'
when I am with this person. I become somebody whom I even abhor when I am with that person. But I like my 'self' pretty well when I am with this particular person.
I am not too bad."" In fact, to love ourselves
may not be that hard after all. Take romance. Suppose there are two girls, and I have feelings
toward both of them. One day I have a date with one of them, and have dinner with her. I enjoy being with her, talking a lot, frequently interjecting jokes,
smiling at each other, and we interact with each other very well. Then suddenly I notice
it's the time for the last train. I rush to the train station
to catch the last one. And at home, I'm happy with myself. As for the other girl, I also like her, but during our date,
I can't talk or joke that much... And we often get awkward silences. I feel like a miserable loser. I don't feel like going on with her, so after having dinner,
we say goodbye to each other. After the two dates, if I were asked
which one I would rather see again, I would choose
the first one without hesitation. There's no doubt I like her, but rather because I like my ""self""
when I am with her. I enjoy my ""self"" when I am with her, and find life worth living
in the life of that ""self"" of mine. The definition of ""love"" may be
to love somebody else, this surely is not wrong, but what I would like to add to it is: Rather, to love means,
with the help of the person we love, for us to be able to love ourselves. That's what I'd like to think. ""I can reveal my inner self as I wish without any difficulties,
being true to myself, when I am with that person, and it will never happen
with anybody else."" Unfortunately, some
of our relationships come to end. Some end out of disputes. Others end due to death. When we grieve over losing our loved ones, we miss the voice and hug of the person, and many other things, but I wonder
if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our ""self""
who lived with that person, thinking: ""Only with them could I
talk freely like that. Only with them could I
be honest with myself. Only with them could I
be silly like that. But that person is gone now, and I can't live the life of that 'self'
of mine I love any longer."" I wonder
if that is what we really grieve over. And, of course, vice versa. If somebody says to me, ""I love you,"" I will be euphoric, yelling, ""Yes!"" But if I were told, ""Thanks to you, I come to love myself,"" or ""I love myself when I'm with you
more than when I am with anybody else,"" that would be something
which strikes my heart more. That my existence validates
one person's existence that way moves me with a deep joy,
something poignant. Each time when we find one ""self"" we love, we may be finding our foothold
we need to go on living. In our life, we feel
like we need to be loved by many people, a certain percentage
of people in our groups, in our class, our workplace. But not that many
of those ""selves"" we love may be necessary. If we find two or three of our ""selves""
we love in ourselves, we can go on with those as our foothold. Five or six may be more than enough. You may think you only have
3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends
who help you like yourself. All depends on how you take it. To love ourselves doesn't mean saying: ""I am crazy about myself,""
looking into a mirror, but, instead, it means, with the help of or via somebody else,
for us to come to love ourselves. It's probably where we start
really loving ourselves. And that is why, as we feel the need, we love others
as indispensable individuals. That's all I want to say. Thank you. (Applause)"

Do you ever have that, just like a big year, like a banner year? For me, it went like this: October 3, I lost my second pregnancy. And then October 8, my dad died of cancer. And then on November 25,
my husband Aaron died after three years
with stage-four glioblastoma, which is just a fancy word
for brain cancer. 00:24So, I'm fun. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28People love to invite me out all the time. Packed social life. Usually, when I talk
about this period of my life, the reaction I get is essentially: 00:39(Sighs) 00:41""I can't -- I can't imagine."" But I do think you can. I think you can. And I think that you should because, someday,
it's going to happen to you. Maybe not these specific losses
in this specific order or at this speed, but like I said, I'm very fun and the research
that I have seen will stun you: everyone you love has
a 100 percent chance of dying. 01:06(Laughter) 01:08And that's why you came to TED. 01:10(Laughter) 01:12(Applause) 01:16So, since all of this loss happened, I've made it a career
to talk about death and loss, not just my own,
because it's pretty easy to recap, but the losses and tragedies
that other people have experienced. It's a niche, I have to say. 01:31(Laughter) 01:33It's a small niche,
and I wish I made more money, but ... 01:36(Laughter) 01:37I've written some very uplifting books, host a very uplifting podcast,
I started a little nonprofit. I'm just trying to do what I can to make more people comfortable
with the uncomfortable, and grief is so uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable,
especially if it's someone else's grief. So part of that work is this group
that I started with my friend Moe, who is also a widow; we call it the Hot Young Widows Club. 02:05(Laughter) 02:06And it's real, we have membership cards and T-shirts. And when your person dies,
your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, literally don't care if you were married, your friends and your family
are just going to look around through friends of friends
of friends of friends until they find someone
who's gone through something similar, and then they'll push you
towards each other so you can talk amongst yourselves
and not get your sad on other people. 02:31(Laughter) 02:33So that's what we do. It's just a series of small groups, where men, women, gay, straight,
married, partnered, can talk about their dead person, and say the things that the other people in their lives
aren't ready or willing to hear yet. Huge range of conversations. Like, ""My husband died two weeks ago, I can't stop thinking
about sex, is that normal?"" 02:58Yeah. 02:59""What if it's one
of the Property Brothers?"" 03:01Less normal, but I'll accept it. 03:03(Laughter) 03:06Things like, ""Look, when I'm out in public
and I see old people holding hands, couples who have clearly
been together for decades, and then I look at them and I imagine all of the things they've been
through together, the good things, the bad things, the arguments they've had
over who should take out the trash ... I just find my heart filled with rage."" 03:25(Laughter) 03:26And that example is personal to me. 03:30Most of the conversations
that we have in the group can and will just stay amongst ourselves, but there are things that we talk about that the rest of the world --
the world that is grief-adjacent but not yet grief-stricken -- could really benefit from hearing. And if you can't tell, I'm only interested in / capable
of unscientific studies, so what I did was go to
The Hot Young Widows Club and say, ""Hello, friends, remember
when your person died?"" They did. 03:56""Do you remember all the things
people said to you?"" 03:59""Oh, yeah."" 04:00""Which ones did you hate the most?"" 04:02I got a lot of comments, lot of answers,
people say a lot of things, but two rose to the top pretty quickly. ""Moving on."" 04:11Now, since 2014, I will tell you I have remarried
a very handsome man named Matthew, we have four children
in our blended family, we live in the suburbs
of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We have a rescue dog. 04:26(Laughter) 04:27I drive a minivan, like the kind where doors open
and I don't even touch them. 04:31(Laughter) 04:33Like, by any ""mezhure,"" life is good. I've also never said ""mezhure,""
I've never once said it that way. 04:39(Laughter) 04:44I don't know where that came from. 04:46(Laughter) 04:48I've never heard
anyone else say it that way. It looks like it should be said that way, and that's why the English
language is trash, so ... 04:55(Laughter) 04:56So impressed with anyone
who, like, speaks it in addition to a language
that makes sense -- good job. 05:01(Laughter) 05:03But by any measure ... 05:04(Laughter) 05:06By any measure, life is really,
really good, but I haven't ""moved on."" I haven't moved on,
and I hate that phrase so much, and I understand why other people do. Because what it says is that Aaron's life and death
and love are just moments that I can leave behind me --
and that I probably should. And when I talk about Aaron,
I slip so easily into the present tense, and I've always thought
that made me weird. And then I noticed that everybody does it. And it's not because we are in denial
or because we're forgetful, it's because the people
we love, who we've lost, are still so present for us. So, when I say, ""Oh, Aaron is ..."" It's because Aaron still is. And it's not in the way
that he was before, which was much better, and it's not in the way that churchy
people try to tell me that he would be. It's just that he's indelible, and so he is present for me. 06:08Here, he's present for me in the work that I do, in the child that we had together, in these three other children I'm raising, who never met him,
who share none of his DNA, but who are only in my life
because I had Aaron and because I lost Aaron. He's present in my marriage to Matthew, because Aaron's life and love and death made me the person
that Matthew wanted to marry. So I've not moved on from Aaron, I've moved forward with him. 06:44(Applause) 06:50We spread Aaron's ashes
in his favorite river in Minnesota, and when the bag was empty -- because when you're cremated,
you fit into a plastic bag -- there were still ashes
stuck to my fingers. And I could have just put my hands
in the water and rinsed them, but instead, I licked my hands clean, because I was so afraid of losing more
than I had already lost, and I was so desperate to make sure
that he would always be a part of me. But of course he would be. 07:22Because when you watch your person
fill himself with poison for three years, just so he can stay alive
a little bit longer with you, that stays with you. When you watch him fade from the healthy
person he was the night you met to nothing, that stays with you. When you watch your son,
who isn't even two years old yet, walk up to his father's bed
on the last day of his life, like he knows what's coming
in a few hours, and say, ""I love you. All done. Bye, bye."" That stays with you. Just like when you fall in love,
finally, like really fall in love with someone who gets you and sees you and you even see, ""Oh, my God,
I've been wrong this entire time. Love is not a contest
or a reality show -- it's so quiet, it's this invisible thread of calm
that connects the two of us even when everything is chaos, when things are falling apart,
even when he's gone."" That stays with you. We used to do this thing -- because my hands are always
freezing and he's so warm, where I would take my ice-cold hands
and shove them up his shirt ... press them against his hot bod. 08:36(Laughter) 08:39And he hated it so much, 08:41(Laughter) 08:42but he loved me, and after he died,
I laid in bed with Aaron and I put my hands underneath him and I felt his warmth. And I can't even tell you
if my hands were cold, but I can tell you that I knew it was the last time
I would ever do that. And that that memory
is always going to be sad. That memory will always hurt. Even when I'm 600 years old
and I'm just a hologram. 09:16(Laughter) 09:20Just like the memory of meeting him
is always going to make me laugh. Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum, it happens alongside of and mixed in
with all of these other emotions. 09:38So, I met Matthew, my current husband -- who doesn't love that title, 09:44(Laughter) 09:48but it's so accurate. 09:50(Laughter) 09:53I met Matthew, and ... there was this audible sigh of relief
among the people who love me, like, ""It's over! She did it. She got a happy ending,
we can all go home. And we did good."" And that narrative
is so appealing even to me, and I thought maybe
I had gotten that, too, but I didn't. I got another chapter. And it's such a good chapter --
I love you, honey -- it's such a good chapter. But especially at the beginning,
it was like an alternate universe, or one of those old ""choose your
own adventure"" books from the '80s where there are two parallel plot lines. So I opened my heart to Matthew, and my brain was like,
""Would you like to think about Aaron? Like, the past, the present, future,
just get in there,"" and I did. And all of a sudden,
those two plots were unfurling at once, and falling in love with Matthew
really helped me realize the enormity of what I lost when Aaron died. And just as importantly, it helped me realize
that my love for Aaron and my grief for Aaron, and my love for Matthew,
are not opposing forces. They are just strands to the same thread. They're the same stuff. 11:18I'm ... what would my parents say? I'm not special. 11:23(Laughter) 11:24They had four kids,
they were like ... frankly. 11:27(Laughter) 11:29But I'm not, I'm not special. I know that, I'm fully aware that all day, every day,
all around the world, terrible things are happening. All the time. Like I said, fun person. But terrible things are happening, people are experiencing deeply formative
and traumatic losses every day. And as part of my job, this weird podcast that I have, I sometimes talk to people about the worst thing
that's ever happened to them. And sometimes, that's the loss
of someone they love, sometimes days ago or weeks ago,
years ago, even decades ago. And these people that I interview, they haven't closed themselves
around this loss and made it the center of their lives. They've lived, their worlds
have kept spinning. But they're talking to me,
a total stranger, about the person they love who has died, because these are the experiences that mark us and make us
just as much as the joyful ones. And just as permanently. Long after you get your last sympathy card or your last hot dish. Like, we don't look
at the people around us experiencing life's joys and wonders
and tell them to ""move on,"" do we? We don't send a card that's like,
""Congratulations on your beautiful baby,"" and then, five years later, think like,
""Another birthday party? Get over it."" 12:55(Laughter) 12:57Yeah, we get it, he's five. 12:58(Laughter) 13:00Wow. 13:01(Laughter) 13:04But grief is kind of one of those things, like, falling in love or having a baby
or watching ""The Wire"" on HBO, where you don't get it
until you get it, until you do it. And once you do it,
once it's your love or your baby, once it's your grief
and your front row at the funeral, you get it. You understand what you're experiencing
is not a moment in time, it's not a bone that will reset, but that you've been touched
by something chronic. Something incurable. It's not fatal, but sometimes
grief feels like it could be. And if we can't prevent it in one another, what can we do? 13:50What can we do other than try
to remind one another that some things can't be fixed, and not all wounds are meant to heal? We need each other to remember, to help each other remember, that grief is this multitasking emotion. That you can and will be sad, and happy;
you'll be grieving, and able to love in the same year or week, the same breath. We need to remember that a grieving person
is going to laugh again and smile again. If they're lucky,
they'll even find love again. But yes, absolutely,
they're going to move forward. But that doesn't mean
that they've moved on. 14:40Thank you. 14:41(Applause)"

""Gabar Nasiib Nasiib Badan,"" which means Jamila
""The Lucky, Lucky Girl."" And I have been very fortunate in my life. My family were originally nomads. And when it rained the night I was born, they stopped in a tiny village
that looked a bit like this, where we lived in the next 11 years until drought and a war with Ethiopia forced us to move
to Somali's capital, Mogadishu. 00:31When I was 18, my father realized
Somalia was headed for a civil war and we are all at risk of being killed. He did his best to get me and my 13 brothers
and sisters out of the country. The family was scattered to the wind. I was lucky. I ended up on my own
as a displaced person in Kenya, and I was fortunate to come to Australia thanks to a backpacker who I met there. 01:03I was incredibly grateful when the Australian government
gave me unemployment benefits while I learned English, but I wanted to find work
as soon as I could. I learned about a Japanese
restaurant that was hiring, and I thought, ""What do I have to lose?"" Mami, the woman who ran front of house, figured my poor English
might be a problem, so she sent me to the kitchen
to meet her husband, Yoshi. Now, Yoshi didn't speak
much English either, but we managed to communicate
with one another. He hired me as a dishwasher
and trained me as a kitchen hand. Now, that couple's kindness
set me on a path where hard work and persistence
led me to my graduation as a software developer and went on to become
a global executive with IBM and later, chief information officer
of Qantas Airways. 02:00Now I want artificial intelligence to do at a massive scale
what that couple did for me: give disadvantaged people
tools to find work, give them the skills
to be great at their jobs, get them to do their jobs safely, to give them a break. You hear stories about how artificial intelligence
is going to take away jobs and automate everything. And in some cases that might be true, but I can tell you
in the real world right now, AI is making amazing things
possible for organizations and for people who otherwise
would have been left behind. Language, education and location
are no longer the barriers they once were. 02:48And to help break down those barriers is one of the reasons
I founded my company. Much of our work
is in global food supply chains, especially in the meat industry. We use computer vision-based AI to create transparency for consumers and to reward producers
who operate ethically and sustainably. 03:10But AI can do much more than that. For example, it can notice
unsafe behaviors, like if someone is not wearing
their personal protective gear correctly, or someone not following
the hygiene procedures, or if someone needs help
on how to carry out a specific task because they're not following
the recipe correctly. We can make sure
people are socially distancing and can provide contact tracing if needed. 03:41We then deliver individualized training
to that person's preferred language both in written and audio formats. Now, ability to read or write
or to speak the local language are no longer the obstacles
they once were. Many of the employees in the food industry are often migrants, refugees
or people from disadvantaged backgrounds who might not be able
to speak the local language and often might not be able
to read or write well. In fact, one of our customers has 49 languages spoken
in some of their facilities, with English long way down the list. When we can see opportunities
for improvements and then deliver training
with that person's preferred language, it makes huge difference
to the organization and to its people. And that is only the beginning. 04:41When I was very young -- about five or six years old,
living in that tiny village -- one of my jobs
was to carry buckets of water from the well to the huts. And I remember putting the buckets down
in every 20 meters or so and how the handles digged into my hands. They were so heavy, and I was so scrawny
because we didn't have enough to eat. Even though that experience
taught me resilience, it's not something I want
any other child to go through. 05:16I want to live in a world
where people are not limited by local language, by geography, by lack of access
to knowledge and training, where everyone is safe at work, when nobody's excluded
because they cannot read or write, where everyone
can fulfill their potential. 05:37Now AI can deliver this world. 05:40Thank you."
1,The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn,Jeremy Howard,Dec 2014,"What happens when we teach a computer how to learn? Technologist Jeremy Howard shares some surprising new developments in the fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give computers the ability to learn Chinese, or to recognize objects in photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis.

to get a computer to do something new, you would have to program it. Now, programming, for those of you here
that haven't done it yourself, requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want
the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now, if you want to do something
that you don't know how to do yourself, then this is going
to be a great challenge. 00:24footnotefootnoteSo this was the challenge faced
by this man, Arthur Samuel. In 1956, he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program, lay out in excruciating detail,
how to be better than you at checkers? So he came up with an idea: he had the computer play
against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked,
and in fact, by 1962, this computer had beaten
the Connecticut state champion. 00:55footnotefootnoteSo Arthur Samuel was
the father of machine learning, and I have a great debt to him, because I am a machine
learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle, a community of over 200,000
machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve
previously unsolved problems, and it's been successful 
hundreds of times. So from this vantage point,
I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning
can do in the past, can do today, and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of 
machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is
possible to find information by using a computer algorithm, and this algorithm is based
on machine learning. Since that time, there have been many
commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest
products that you might like to buy, movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes, it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about
who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it, and this is because it's using
the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have
learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. 02:07footnotefootnoteThis is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat
the two world champions at ""Jeopardy,"" answering incredibly subtle
and complex questions like this one. [""The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing
from this city's national museum in 2003 
(along with a lot of other stuff)""] This is also why we are now able
to see the first self-driving cars. If you want to be able to tell
the difference between, say, a tree and a pedestrian,
well, that's pretty important. We don't know how to write
those programs by hand, but with machine learning,
this is now possible. And in fact, this car has driven 
over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. 02:40footnotefootnoteSo we now know that computers can learn, and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes
don't know how to do ourselves, or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples
I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy
called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for
automatic drug discovery. Now, what was extraordinary here
is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck
or the international academic community, but nobody on the team had any background
in chemistry or biology or life sciences, and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this? They used an extraordinary algorithm
called deep learning. So important was this that in fact
the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page
article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton
here on the left-hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm
inspired by how the human brain works, and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations
on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more
computation time you give it, the better it gets. 03:48footnotefootnoteThe New York Times also
showed in this article another extraordinary
result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers 
can listen and understand. 04:00footnotefootnote(Video) Richard Rashid: Now, the last step that I want to be able
to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is, we've been able to take a large amount 
of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text-to-speech system that takes Chinese text
and converts it into Chinese language, and then we've taken
an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text-to-speech system
so that it would sound like me. Again, the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. (In Chinese) (Applause) There's much work to be done in this area. (In Chinese) (Applause) 05:01Jeremy Howard: Well, that was at
a machine learning conference in China. It's not often, actually,
at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause, although of course sometimes
at TEDx conferences, feel free. Everything you saw there
was happening with deep learning. (Applause) Thank you. The transcription in English
was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text
in the top right, deep learning, and the construction of the voice
was deep learning as well. 05:26footnotefootnoteSo deep learning is
this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that
can seem to do almost anything, and I discovered that a year earlier,
it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign 
Recognition Benchmark, deep learning had learned
to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it
recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm, the leaderboard actually showed
it was better than people, about twice as good as people. So by 2011, we had the first example of computers that can see
better than people. Since that time, a lot has happened. In 2012, Google announced that
they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data
on 16,000 computers for a month, and the computer independently learned
about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way
that humans learn. Humans don't learn
by being told what they see, but by learning for themselves
what these things are. Also in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton,
who we saw earlier, won the very popular ImageNet competition, looking to try to figure out 
from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of 2014, we're now down
to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people, again. 06:41footnotefootnoteSo machines really are doing
an extraordinarily good job of this, and it is now being used in industry. For example, Google announced last year that they had mapped every single
location in France in two hours, and the way they did it was
that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm
to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long
it would have taken before: dozens of people, many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of 
the Chinese Google, I guess, and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded
to Baidu's deep learning system, and underneath you can see that the system
has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually
have similar backgrounds, similar directions of the faces, even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking
at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which
really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions
of images in real time. 07:46footnotefootnoteSo what does it mean
now that computers can see? Well, it's not just 
that computers can see. In fact, deep learning
has done more than that. Complex, nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable
with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here, this Stanford-based system
showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence
is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact
is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about
and what it is saying about those things. Also, deep learning has
been used to read Chinese, again at about native
Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed
out of Switzerland by people, none of whom speak
or understand any Chinese. As I say, using deep learning is about the best system
in the world for this, even compared to native
human understanding. 08:36This is a system that we
put together at my company which shows putting
all this stuff together. These are pictures which
have no text attached, and as I'm typing in here sentences, in real time it's understanding
these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar
to the text that I'm writing. So you can see, it's actually
understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen
something like this on Google, where you can type in things
and it will show you pictures, but actually what it's doing is it's
searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually
understanding the images. This is something that computers
have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. 09:17footnotefootnoteSo we can see now that computers
can not only see but they can also read, and, of course, we've shown that they
can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that
I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated
using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm
out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm
to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen
a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before,
it's seen black before, it's seen a guitar before, but it has independently generated
this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human
performance here, but we're close. In tests, humans prefer
the computer-generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old, so probably within the next year, the computer algorithm will be
well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. 10:16footnotefootnoteSo we put all this together and it leads
to very exciting opportunities. For example, in medicine, a team in Boston announced
that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors
make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly, in Stanford, a group there announced that,
looking at tissues under magnification, they've developed 
a machine learning-based system which in fact is better
than human pathologists at predicting survival rates
for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases, not only
were the predictions more accurate, but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case, they were new clinical indicators
that humans can understand. In this pathology case, the computer system actually discovered
that the cells around the cancer are as important as
the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists
had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases,
they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts
and machine learning experts, but as of last year,
we're now beyond that too. This is an example of
identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here
can identify those areas more accurately, or about as accurately,
as human pathologists, but was built entirely with deep learning
using no medical expertise by people who have
no background in the field. Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons
about as accurately as humans can, but this system was developed
with deep learning using people with no previous 
background in medicine. 11:56footnotefootnoteSo myself, as somebody with
no previous background in medicine, I seem to be entirely well qualified
to start a new medical company, which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it, but the theory seemed to suggest
that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine
using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully, the feedback
has been fantastic, not just from the media
but from the medical community, who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take
the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis
as much as possible, leaving doctors to do
what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about 15 minutes
to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now, but I've compressed it down to 
three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you
creating a medical diagnostic test, I'm going to show you 
a diagnostic test of car images, because that's something
we can all understand. 12:54So here we're starting with 
about 1.5 million car images, and I want to create something
that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled,
so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm, it can automatically identify
areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human
and the computer can now work together. So the human, as you can see here, is telling the computer
about areas of interest which it wants the computer then
to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now, these deep learning systems actually
are in 16,000-dimensional space, so you can see here the computer
rotating this through that space, trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully, the human who is driving it can then
point out the areas that are interesting. So here, the computer has
successfully found areas, for example, angles. So as we go through this process, we're gradually telling
the computer more and more about the kinds of structures
we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying
areas of pathosis, for example, or a radiologist indicating
potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be
difficult for the algorithm. In this case, it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs
of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful, manually selecting these fronts
as opposed to the backs, then telling the computer
that this is a type of group that we're interested in. 14:21So we do that for a while,
we skip over a little bit, and then we train the
machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things, and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see, it's now started to fade
some of these pictures out, showing us that it already is recognizing
how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept
of similar images, and using similar images, you can now see, the computer at this point is able to
entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point, the human
can tell the computer, okay, yes, you've done
a good job of that. 14:53Sometimes, of course, even at this point it's still difficult
to separate out groups. In this case, even after we let the
computer try to rotate this for a while, we still find that the left sides
and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give
the computer some hints, and we say, okay, try and find
a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides
as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint --
ah, okay, it's been successful. It's managed to find a way
of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. 15:26So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human
is being replaced by a computer, but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing
something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something
that takes 15 minutes for one person acting alone. 15:50So this process takes about
four or five iterations. You can see we now have 62 percent of our 1.5 million images 
classified correctly. And at this point, we
can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections, check through them to make sure
that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes, we can
let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process
for each of the different groups, we are now up to
an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images. And at this point, it's just a case of finding the small number
that aren't classified correctly, and trying to understand why. And using that approach, by 15 minutes we get
to 97 percent classification rates. 16:31footnotefootnoteSo this kind of technique
could allow us to fix a major problem, which is that there's a lack
of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says
that there's between a 10x and a 20x shortage of physicians
in the developing world, and it would take about 300 years to train enough people
to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help
enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches? 16:56footnotefootnoteSo I'm very excited
about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that
every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services
are over 80 percent of employment. What are services? These are services. These are also the exact things that
computers have just learned how to do. So 80 percent of the world's employment
in the developed world is stuff that computers 
have just learned how to do. What does that mean? Well, it'll be fine.
They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example, there will be
more jobs for data scientists. Well, not really. It doesn't take data scientists 
very long to build these things. For example, these four algorithms
were all built by the same guy. So if you think, oh, 
it's all happened before, we've seen the results in the past
of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs, what are these new jobs going to be? It's very hard for us to estimate this, because human performance
grows at this gradual rate, but we now have a system, deep learning, that we know actually grows
in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently, we see the things around us and we say, ""Oh, computers
are still pretty dumb."" Right? But in five years' time,
computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think
about this capability right now. 18:10We have seen this once before, of course. In the Industrial Revolution, we saw a step change
in capability thanks to engines. The thing is, though,
that after a while, things flattened out. There was social disruption, but once engines were used 
to generate power in all the situations, things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different
from the Industrial Revolution, because the Machine Learning Revolution,
it never settles down. The better computers get
at intellectual activities, the more they can build better computers
to be better at intellectual capabilities, so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually
never experienced before, so your previous understanding
of what's possible is different. 18:50This is already impacting us. In the last 25 years,
as capital productivity has increased, labor productivity has been flat,
in fact even a little bit down. 19:01footnotefootnoteSo I want us to start
having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people
about this situation, people can be quite dismissive. Well, computers can't really think, they don't emote,
they don't understand poetry, we don't really understand how they work. So what? Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most
of their time being paid to do, so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our
social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality. Thank you. (Applause)"

lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. 00:30But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. 01:09Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s 
celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. 01:55As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. 02:26The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. 03:18When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. 03:53Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. 04:27And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion."

place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. 00:20If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. 00:29She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. 00:39And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. 00:56We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. 01:08If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. 01:34Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. 02:11Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. 03:15In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step."

1,The relationship between sex and imagination,Gina Gutierrez,Jun 2022,"Sex is as much mental as it is physical -- and imagination is the most powerful tool we have to expand our personal agency and capacity for pleasure, says sexual wellness storyteller Gina Gutierrez. The founder of audio-erotica company Dipsea, Gutierrez creates immersive audio stories designed to open up space to explore your desires and fantasies on your terms. She shares some tips to inspire your sexual imagination and bring joy, confidence and empowerment into your life.", (50K),"Transcript (12 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)00:01""Oh, I'm not in the mood"". Who here has ever
told a partner that before? 00:08(Laughter and murmuring) 00:12We've all done this. And if you haven't said it,
then you've probably heard it. Intuitively, we understand that our minds matter
when it comes to sex, but we’re quick to focus
on bodies, touch and sensation as the most crucial elements. We're less likely to consider
the role of our imaginations. 00:32In many parts of our life,
we are really great at imagining. Things like vacations
or dream homes or career moves. These exercises in imagination
help us define what it is we want. They allow us to flirt
with what's possible before having to make any decisions. And they're also innately pleasurable, even if those fantasies
never actually materialize. Imagination is such a powerful tool. So when it comes to sex, why isn't it
one of the first ones that we reach for? When I first started doing research
on arousal and desire, I learned that for women,
cognition is as important to arousal as the presence of sexual stimuli. In other words, using their memories,
fantasies and some focus, women can turn themselves on
with their thoughts. This particular study focused on women, and much of my own work is also focused
on people who are female identifying. But this much is clear
regardless of gender identity: the brain is the biggest sex organ, and everyone can benefit
from expanding their sexual imagination. 01:42I first started thinking about this connection
between sex and imagination while I was in college. Back then, among my friends, the definition of sex
was extremely narrow. It essentially meant penetrative sex
between a guy and a girl. And masturbation
wasn't a topic of conversation. Frankly, I think that solo sex
was seen as a last resort, a desperate or lonely act instead of a fundamentally
empowering exploration. 02:12One morning, a friend of mine
was telling me about her latest unsatisfying hookup, and I asked her what
she had been thinking about during sex. ""Hmm,"" she said. “I don’t know.” 02:27Something about that really struck me. Her entire memory of the experience
was what had happened physically. So many of us think that good sex
is something that should happen to us, that it’s in someone else’s hands,
quite literally, We expect a partner, current or future,
to be the magical unlock. Maybe because we feel
especially safe with them or attracted to them or because they have
more experience than we do. But in doing so, we forget
our own agency in the matter. We write ourselves and our imaginations
out of the pleasure equation. 03:04I had this hunch that my friend, that many of us, were experiencing
a crisis of inspiration. In the years after college, my fascination with the role
of imagination and sexuality only grew. Eventually, I left the career I'd built
to start a company called Dipsea, which creates stories, audio stories,
designed to turn women on. I decided to focus on audio because it's so immersive
and so evocative and so personal. 03:36Here's what I mean. Feel free to close your eyes
and consider where these sounds take you. 03:42(Birds chirping) 03:44(Water flowing) 03:57OK. Open your eyes. Were those not the sounds
you were imagining I'd play? 04:02(Laughter) 04:03Here's what comes to my mind. I'm in the mountains. I can feel the sunshine on my face. I can feel the cool chill
coming up off the Alpine water. I can see the tiny flecks
of sparkle in the granite. I bet that every person in this room
is imagining something a little different, but filled with all sorts of distinct
details about the surroundings, about the circumstances. Audio is incredible that way. Erotic audio stories
have characters and plot, but like the sounds you just heard
create a blueprint for your mind to then fill in the blanks. They allow you to develop
your own vision of what's appealing in a way that can get lost when you see something specific
or explicit onscreen. 04:51You may not be ready or interested in dipping a toe
into erotic audio stories. And that's OK. So today I'm going to walk you through how you might get started
creating your own stories and activating
your own sexual imagination. I won't take this too far.
You don't have to follow along right now. But consider this a guide for the next time
you get a little me time. 05:13(Laughter) 05:15First, you'll want to settle
into your mind the same way that you
might start a meditation. Then imagine that your mind
is like a projector. Everything you can see and experience
is what's right in front of you. Everything to your left,
right, behind you, that's out of frame. This is important because
while there are thoughts that turn us on, there are also thoughts that are
incredibly effective at turning us off: stress, shame, insecurities, and also the things
that inexplicably ick us out. So when a thought appears
that isn't working, and it inevitably will, you'll be able to sweep it out of frame. 05:57You can start with your senses. Imagine colors, textures, sounds, images, anything that gives you sensory pleasure. Sometimes I like to imagine
cherry blossoms softly floating down from trees. Or I use a fiery pinkish orange
or a relaxing blue as a backdrop for the experience that I'm imagining. 06:19Next, try places. And keep in mind that setting
will be more important to some of us than to others. Reach back into your memory to that secluded beach
you visited many years ago. Or create a setting from scratch
with as much privacy and comfort, or as many adventurous stakes as you like. Next think about a person
and layer on a narrative. Maybe it's a character
from one of your favorite books. Maybe it's your girlfriend. Hey, maybe it's a guy in a kilt. Whoever it is, how do they approach you? What's motivating them? What energy are they coming to you with? What about you? What do you say? And what do you do together? And when you find something
that you really like, play it out for a while. You’ll have just designed your own story. 07:09The more you flex this muscle, the more you'll understand
what turns you on and be able to communicate
those things to a partner. You can share the entire fantasy
with them if you're comfortable. That kind of disclosure
can be very intimate and affirming. Or ... don't. It is not a betrayal
to use your imagination to bring you more pleasure. Fantasy is a safe space, and it's time we bust the myth
that what you fantasize about and what you want to happen in reality are always the same thing. 07:44So allow me to offer us
a bigger definition of what sex is. Sex isn't just a physical act. It's a mental experience. And it isn't wholly
dependent on a partner. It starts with you. You're the one in control
of creating the most pleasure for you. You're the protagonist. As much as you love someone
or feel attracted to them, they are playing a supporting role. And you for them. Sex is an avenue to accessing feelings
of aliveness, empowerment, joy and confidence innate to all of us. That aliveness,
that is the impact of sexual wellness. And you will feel it
walking down the street, entering any conversation,
navigating any relationship. Put that way, none of us can afford
not to prioritize sex. It isn't a nice-to-have
or an if-I-get-to-it, dead last on our list
right after picking up the dry cleaning. 08:45So the next time you notice that you haven't been
in the mood for a while, carve some time out for yourself and let your imagination

1,Why bittersweet emotions underscore life's beauty,Susan Cain,May 2022,"Life is a constant state of both joy and sorrow, dark and light, bitter and sweet. In a meditative conversation, author Susan Cain explores how being attuned to the bittersweetness of life -- and being fully present for both the happy times and the sad times -- helps us navigate love and loss and connect to the ""insane beauty"" of the world. (This conversation, hosted by TED current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was part of an exclusive TED Membership event. Visit ted...", (47K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de Portugalالعربية中文 (简体)한국어00:00Susan Cain: The idea of bittersweetness
is that we live in a constant state, all humans do, it's a constant state
of a kind of existence simultaneously of joy and sorrow, dark and light, bitter and sweet. And then what comes with that is a heightened awareness
of impermanence in all things, and also a kind of curiously piercing joy
at the beauty of the world. Because there's something
about having this deep awareness that the joy comes with sorrow,
the sorrow comes with joy, that makes us really attuned
to the insane beauty all around us. 00:42You know, I think the Stoics
come at that from one point of view. You know, there's the stoic idea
of, they would call it memento mori, to remember all the time
that we could die tomorrow, we don't know what's going to happen. And that's a way of both calming us down and also making life feel
a little more precious. So you know, the Stoics come at it
from that point of view. I don't know that I think of myself
as a Stoic explicitly, but I do feel there's something
about being aware of life's fragility that situates us exactly
where we should be. 01:18Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Why do you think art is a way that we see
bittersweetness being expressed really masterfully? 01:29SC: I believe that all humans ... That the most fundamental
aspect of our humanity is that we all have a kind of
longing for a state that I call the perfect
and beautiful world. You know, like in ""The Wizard of Oz,""
it's called ""somewhere over the rainbow,"" all religions have their own name for it, my favorite is the Sufi name
of the beloved of the soul. And what creativity really is
at the end of the day is an expression of that longing
for a more perfect and beautiful world. You know, what an artist
or a musician is doing, is they're having a vision of ... You know, the gap between
the world that we're in and the world that they longed to be in
and therefore to create. And so whether you're talking
about a violin piece or a rocket to Mars, there's really no difference
between those two things. 02:21Like, the word longing itself, the etymology of it literally means
to reach for, you know, to grow longer and to reach for. And that's what we're doing
when we're creative. And I do want to hasten to say that ... You don't need to compose a symphony that people are going to be listening to
hundreds of years later. You don't have to build the rocket to Mars in order to express
that fundamental human creativity. You could be sitting at home
and drawing a picture or baking a pie. It doesn't really matter. Like, all these different actions are expressions of our longing
and of our better nature. 03:01I believe that the art and the music and the nature and religion
and spirituality are all just different
manifestations of the same thing. And what that thing is, we probably
all have to define for ourselves, but it is the most fundamental
drive in all of human nature. And I believe our best one, you know,
it's the one that leads to creativity, but also to connection and to love. Like, I literally -- sorry to go on
with this question, but I literally have sitting taped up
in front of me in my office right now ... A quotation from the poet
Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī, who was a Sufi poet, and I'm going to quote it for you, but I'm just going to set
the context of the poem. It's basically ... It’s about a man who is praying to Allah, and a cynical person
comes along and asks him, ""Why are you praying? You never got an answer back, did you? So why are you praying?"" 04:03And the man thinks about it and is troubled
by the cynic's observation. And he falls into a fitful sleep during
which he's visited by Khidr, the guide of souls, who says to him, ""Why did you stop praying?"" 04:18And he said, ""Well, you know,
God never answered me, Allah never answered."" 04:22And this is what Khidr
says to him, he says, and now I'm quoting from the poem itself, ""This longing you express
is the return message. The grief you cry out from
draws you toward union. Your pure sadness that wants help
is the secret cup."" 04:40And I have this taped up in my office because I believe that ... I believe that that's the truth, whether we consider ourselves atheists
or believers or somewhere in between. To me, is a false dichotomy. 04:54WPR: It's beautiful. Can you share a little bit more
about the process that went into writing this book and how you ultimately found yourself in this place where bittersweet
was the end product? 05:09SC: As most of us do,
I come from a heritage of love and loss. In my case, most members of my family,
the previous generations, were killed in the Holocaust. On my mother's side and my father's side. You know, I explore in the book
the whole phenomenon of inherited grief, how it transmits to us,
both culturally and epigenetically. And so I think that that's a kind of
unconscious backdrop that had been with me from the beginning. Of just having a sense
of kind of, like a tragic view of life, but also a view that I kind of, just can't believe
how beautiful it is sometimes. So I'm sort of holding
those two things at the same time. And yeah, so I just had
all these questions about how to make sense
of this paradox of life. 06:07And so I just went off
on this five-year journey. I mean, I went and talked to Pete Docter,
who is the director at Pixar, who created the movie ""Inside Out,"" which is a movie that's really
all about sadness and the positive value
that sadness has in our lives. And as I say, I explored
all these wisdom traditions. I went and talked to neuroscientists. I spent a lot of time with a psychologist
named Dacher Keltner, who's done all this fascinating, groundbreaking work on what he calls
your inner compassionate instinct and how we're basically
evolutionarily designed to react to the sadness of other beings. And this comes from the fact that we're creatures
who have to take care of our young like, we don't survive
if we don't do that. And so that means that we're primed
to respond to the cries of babies. Except it radiates out from there. We don't only respond
to our own baby's tears, we end up responding to other babies, and we also end up responding
to other beings in general. And we definitely do not get this right, because we also, as Darwin had noticed, Darwin said, we have this deep,
compassionate instinct, but we also have obviously this propensity
to these astonishing acts of cruelty. So both of these things are part of us. And ... And the question becomes, how do we most draw
on the compassionate side of our deeper instincts? 07:45WPR: There's a question here from Miriam where they ask just about how
we can be present for each other as we're feeling different emotions. The question specifically is, ""Can we be fully present for one another
if one is experiencing sadness and the other is happiness?"" 08:01SC: Yeah, I think the answer is to be
fully present for each other. And I'll tell you one little hack
that I've developed for that. I don’t know if hack is the right word. But there’s this amazing video
that went viral a few years ago. It was put out by the Cleveland
Clinic Hospital. And this was a video
that they put together to teach empathy to their caregivers. And the way they did this, is they had a camera kind of, moving through the corridors
of the hospital, lingering for a moment on the face
of this passer-by or that passer-by. Just the way you do in normal life, right? You're like, walking through
and you just see people as you go and you’re not really thinking
that much about it. Except that in the case of this video, they had little captions
underneath each random person that you were passing by. And sometimes the captions
were joyful ones, like, ""just learned that he's going to be
a father for the first time."" But because we're in a hospital,
more often the captions are not so joyful. And it's things like, you know, caption under a little girl saying
goodbye to her father for the last time. It's things like that. And you cannot watch this video
without tearing up. It's impossible. Which is why it went viral. You also become aware,
as you're watching it, you're not only tearing up, you literally are having the sensation
of expanding chest muscles. Like, you can feel it
physically and literally. And ... And we actually know
from the work of Dacher Keltner, who I was just talking about, that we have our vagus nerve, which is the biggest bundle
of nerves in our body, and it governs our most
fundamental instincts, like breathing and digestion. You know it's really basic. But your vagus nerve
also responds and fires up when it sees somebody else in distress. So you know, this is a very deep
and fundamental impulse. And what I take from the lesson
of that Cleveland Clinic video is just the simple exercise of imagining
what people's captions are as you walk through the world. You know, you don't necessarily know them. But now I'll go into a grocery store and as the person's
ringing up my groceries, I'm thinking, what's her caption? What is it? And it's a completely different way
of interacting with people once you do that. 10:28WPR: And connected to this, Gordon asks how your experience
with the pandemic and lockdown informed the writing of the book. Did it change the book from what you initially
envisioned it to be? 10:41SC: My father and my brother
actually passed away from COVID quite early during the pandemic. There's something about grappling
with these subjects for years, as I had been doing, that actually helped me pass
through those particular moments and weather those particular moments. I guess I'll just give you
one specific example. So one of the wisdom traditions
that I found most illuminating, and I wrote about this in the book, it's the one that Leonard Cohen's
song comes from, you know, the idea of light coming
from the crack in everything. So he got that from the Kabbalah, which is the mystical side
of the Jewish tradition. And one of the fundamental
stories in the Kabbalah is the idea that all of creation originally
was one divine vessel of light that ultimately shattered and that now we're living in the world
after the shattering. But these divine shards of light
are still scattered all around us, and they're buried
in the mud all around us. And so our job is
to walk through the world and pick up the shards where we can
and maybe shine them up a little bit. And the beauty is that I'm going
to see one set of shards, but you're going to notice
completely different ones. So we all go around and pick up our own. 12:04When my father passed away from COVID, I started reflecting on his life and ... My father was a person who ... He was a doctor
and a med school professor, and he worked really,
really hard and did great work. And at the same time that he did all that, he also would perform these, you could call them
senseless acts of beauty, maybe. He loved orchids, so he built a greenhouse
full of orchids in our basement. For really no reason
other than that he loved orchids. And so he grew them and gazed at them. And he loved the French language, so he learned how to speak French, even though he had no time
to visit France and rarely did. But he would sit there and learn it
and loved the act of learning it. And there were so many different
things like this that he did. And when he died, I started thinking
about all those acts of beauty that he had performed in his work and in these seemingly
senseless acts of beauty. And I framed them all as shards
that he had been picking up all his life. And ... That was, yeah, that was a really helpful way of thinking of him
and remembering him and bringing me to some form
of peace with his loss. 13:28WPR: As we slowly come out
of the pandemic, how can we better normalize
talking about loss and talking about these feelings that you've mentioned
our culture sort of shies away from? 13:39SC: Well, I think it's really helpful
to start in our organizations. I mean, we can obviously start privately, which in some ways is the easiest because we don't have to corral
anybody else to do it. But in our organizations, there are small steps that we can take. So I'm thinking, for example, I do a lot of public speaking, lately Zoom talks, where I come in
and talk about introversion and I guess now bittersweetness. Anyway, I did one not that long ago,
it was a Zoom call. And we were talking
about the power of introverts. And the call started with a chat,
just the way this one did. And the organizer asked them questions
like, ""How's everybody feeling today?"" And everybody typed in, you know,
""I'm feeling great."" ""I'm feeling excited,""
""I'm feeling joyful,"" feeling all these things. And I love it. If they were in fact
feeling that way, that's awesome. And I also ask, what is the chance
that everybody truly was feeling that way? This long list of people
coming into the chat, what's the chance that was accurate? Maybe zero percent? I would love to see us develop ways, and maybe the way to start
is with anonymous chats or an option to be anonymous in chats, but for organizers and for team leaders
and so on to be asking, ""What are you all truly feeling?"" ""What are you going through right now?"" And again, maybe anonymous and maybe not. When we're gathering in person, we could have whiteboards up. In schools they sometimes do this
and they call it a parking lot, where people could just write down
what they're going through that day, the joys and the sorrows, so that people start becoming aware
of kind of like, the normality of what actual experience is. 15:26We as a society need to figure out
how we can start telling the truth of what it's like to be alive. That's what I would say. I mean, that's actually
the reason I write books, that's how I always think of it. It's like there's really no point
other than telling a truth that isn't otherwise
being spoken out loud. 15:49And there's also an incredible
safety in numbers, you know. Once lots of people start
talking about the same thing, it suddenly becomes OK
to tell that particular truth of what it's like to be alive. So we have to just find ways of telling it and then more and more
people will share it. 16:06[Get access to thought-provoking events

for something called a 360 review. 00:05(Laughter) 00:08If you've ever worked
in the corporate world, you probably have heard
of this diabolical exercise. 00:13(Laughter) 00:15It’s an anonymous survey with
your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense
of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy
version of a 360 review. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28Which included my wife, my brother
and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave
hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start
by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought
was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers
and spin instructors, so -- 05:05(Laughter) 05:07And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons
emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart
and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" 05:17(Laughter) 05:19Hard pass. 05:20(Laughter) 05:21Pasadena. I was not going to do that. 05:24But over the ensuing days
of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons
were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing
glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss
about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing
my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose
and rugged good looks. 05:46(Laughter) 05:47And in the face of all of this
roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche
of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably
self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves
and a retractable jaw. 06:06After about five or six days
of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going
to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude,
I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing,
but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based
neurotic programs, probably injected into me
by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism
trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them,
they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive
extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. 07:03Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment,
we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend
Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish
and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. 07:19(Laughter) 07:21It's OK, sweetie.
You're good at so many other things. 07:23(Laughter) 07:25(Applause) 07:29I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing
I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you
don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with
your level of productivity or you have failed
to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. 07:51The vastly superior alternative
is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. 07:59(Laughter) 08:01As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned
how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships
with other people. And because relationships
are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood,
not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better
at loving other people. And the flip side of this
was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which
I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships
with other people. And as those relationships
suffered, so did I. 08:40Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur
unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” 08:51(Laughter) 08:53That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious
about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term
because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children
to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause)"

hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start
by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought
was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers
and spin instructors, so -- 05:05(Laughter) 05:07And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons
emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart
and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" 05:17(Laughter) 05:19Hard pass. 05:20(Laughter) 05:21Pasadena. I was not going to do that. 05:24But over the ensuing days
of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons
were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing
glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss
about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing
my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose
and rugged good looks. 05:46(Laughter) 05:47And in the face of all of this
roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche
of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably
self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves
and a retractable jaw. 06:06After about five or six days
of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going
to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude,
I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing,
but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based
neurotic programs, probably injected into me
by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism
trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them,
they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive
extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. 07:03Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment,
we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend
Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish
and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. 07:19(Laughter) 07:21It's OK, sweetie.
You're good at so many other things. 07:23(Laughter) 07:25(Applause) 07:29I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing
I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you
don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with
your level of productivity or you have failed
to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. 07:51The vastly superior alternative
is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. 07:59(Laughter) 08:01As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned
how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships
with other people. And because relationships
are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood,
not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better
at loving other people. And the flip side of this
was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which
I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships
with other people. And as those relationships
suffered, so did I. 08:40Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur
unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” 08:51(Laughter) 08:53That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious
about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term
because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children
to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause)"

watching my father raise the pistol to my mother's head. She pleaded with him to put the gun down, but he ignored her. When she bolted toward the door,
he followed close behind and once outside,
he fired one single shot. I was 12. I remember this moment frame by frame. I remember feeling numb. I remember feeling alone. 00:34Thank God, the bullet missed her, but my family would never be the same. I would never be the same. I didn't know then all the ways that my parents' on-again,
off-again relationship would impact me, but I knew I didn't want
a love like theirs. My story would be different. 00:57Years later, when I met you, I fell madly in love. Our connection was undeniable. It was as if you had been
hand-picked just for me. I thought we'd be together forever. But we struggled with some
of the same issues my parents had, and after nearly nine years together, we called it quits. 01:19We had Sekou then. He was only three. Though he was too young
to really understand what was going on, he was old enough to know that mommy and daddy were not going to be living
in the same house anymore. 01:33Our breakup hit me really hard. But I decided I wouldn't let my broken heart
get in the way of what was best for Sekou. We struggled initially,
trying to navigate this new space as co-parents. I asked myself, how do we raise this beautiful boy
full of wonder and promise and so much power, in spite of our failures as a couple? The answer for me was simple. I could either choose fear, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, or choose love. And I chose love. That means seeing
the good in you as a father. It means seeing
the good in you as a father and not your missteps as a partner. It means putting Sekou first every time, even if it means I don't get my way. 02:33I know my parents went back and forth trying to work things out
for my brother and I's sake. Though I appreciate their effort, I wish they hadn't. I saw too much, I heard too much. I knew I didn't want
that to be Sekou's story. I wanted Sekou to know what it was like to see
two parents who got along, two parents who worked together as a team. I wanted him to know what love looks like in its truest form. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not anger easily, it keeps no wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres. 03:25Shaka Senghor: It was 1983. I was 11 years old. I remember being in a basement
with my father, in our home on the east side of Detroit. I watched him stuff albums into the blue and orange milk crates, as tears streamed from his eyes. Just before that, him and my mother had just sat me and my siblings down and told us that they
were calling it quits. Thirty years later, I found myself with tears in my eyes, as I packed my belongings in our home. 04:11Ebony and I met while I was serving
a 19-year prison sentence. For four years, we used letters, phone calls and visits to build what we had imagined
to be an unshakeable bond. We fought the system together, and we thought that we would be able
to right the wrongs of our parents. She was a poet, I was a writer. She was gorgeous, with a PhD. I was handsome, with a GED. 04:49(Laughter) 04:53We built something magical. We built something
that we thought would endure. But unfortunately, our relationship became unhinged
when I was released from prison. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, trauma from prior to going to prison, baggage from her relationship, my inexperience in a relationship undid the magic of what we built
behind the walls. Centered in all of that was our beautiful boy. 05:32I remember when we first
brought Sekou home. It was so exciting, it was amazing, we worked together, we collaborated, we supported each other. You took the night shift,
I took the morning shift. And it was going amazing. And then it all changed. It changed the morning that you came in
really excited, you was like, ""Hey, I'm going back to work! Aren't you excited?"" And I was like, ""Yes.
I am ecstatic right now. 06:02(Laughter) 06:03I cannot be more delighted."" But inside, I was really afraid. But I couldn't tell you that. So instead, I said, ""Hey, go off and have a wonderful day."" 06:20And you left, and I was left with Sekou. What I understand now about that moment is that we were fostering a trust that's necessary for parents to coexist. And that you were trusting me
with our most precious gift. And that you were building the foundation
and the blocks for what's important for this portal we call parenthood. 06:48ER: Knowing how our parents'
breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising
a black boy in a society that says that black boys,
black bodies and black lives only seen as profitable or disposable. And then there's the other side. Possibility of two parents
who are no longer together coexisting, supporting each other, loving each other,
showing affection publicly in a way that honors
the relationship with our son. And even more importantly is the power to support each other
in all those vulnerable moments. 10:43There was this one time that it was my day to go pick up Sekou,
you remember that time? I go pick Sekou up, he's in first grade, and as I'm walking up, another parent walks up
and says, ""Hey, Shaka. I seen Oprah Winfrey
give a shout-out to you on CNN last night."" She was super excited, exuberant even. I was mortified. Because I thought, what's going to happen
when she tells another parent, and they tell another parent, and then they go and look me up and then they discover that I was in prison
for second-degree murder. And then their child hears about it. And they come to school,
and they say to Sekou, ""Your dad was convicted
of murdering someone."" And I remember,
as watching Sekou race out, and I knew that I had to call Ebony. When I called her,
I explained to her what happened, Ebony said, ""You have to have the talk."" 11:44So I took Sekou home, got him ready for bed, and we talked for half an hour. I talked to him
about why I went to prison. And I listened to his feedback. And then we called his mom
so we can do our nightly ritual of her offering prayer and then me doing affirmations. And I remember holding him tightly. And I realized the importance
of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.
Sekou: I'm amazing. 13:28SS: I am thoughtful.
Sekou: I am thoughtful. 13:31SS: I am kind.
Sekou: I am kind. 13:32SS: I am loving.
Sekou: I am loving. 13:34SS: I am caring.
Sekou: I am caring. 13:35SS: I am funny.
Sekou: I am funny. 13:37SS: I'm smart.
Sekou: I'm smart. 13:39SS: I'm a big boy.
Sekou: I'm a big boy. 13:41SS: I'm a soldier.
Sekou: I'm a soldier. 13:43SS: I'm a warrior.
Sekou: I'm a warrior. 13:44SS: I am Sekou.
Sekou: I am Sekou. 13:46(Cheers and applause) 13:52ER: Good job, baby."

breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising
a black boy in a society that says that black boys,
black bodies and black lives only seen as profitable or disposable. And then there's the other side. Possibility of two parents
who are no longer together coexisting, supporting each other, loving each other,
showing affection publicly in a way that honors
the relationship with our son. And even more importantly is the power to support each other
in all those vulnerable moments. 10:43There was this one time that it was my day to go pick up Sekou,
you remember that time? I go pick Sekou up, he's in first grade, and as I'm walking up, another parent walks up
and says, ""Hey, Shaka. I seen Oprah Winfrey
give a shout-out to you on CNN last night."" She was super excited, exuberant even. I was mortified. Because I thought, what's going to happen
when she tells another parent, and they tell another parent, and then they go and look me up and then they discover that I was in prison
for second-degree murder. And then their child hears about it. And they come to school,
and they say to Sekou, ""Your dad was convicted
of murdering someone."" And I remember,
as watching Sekou race out, and I knew that I had to call Ebony. When I called her,
I explained to her what happened, Ebony said, ""You have to have the talk."" 11:44So I took Sekou home, got him ready for bed, and we talked for half an hour. I talked to him
about why I went to prison. And I listened to his feedback. And then we called his mom
so we can do our nightly ritual of her offering prayer and then me doing affirmations. And I remember holding him tightly. And I realized the importance
of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.
Sekou: I'm amazing. 13:28SS: I am thoughtful.
Sekou: I am thoughtful. 13:31SS: I am kind.
Sekou: I am kind. 13:32SS: I am loving.
Sekou: I am loving. 13:34SS: I am caring.
Sekou: I am caring. 13:35SS: I am funny.
Sekou: I am funny. 13:37SS: I'm smart.
Sekou: I'm smart. 13:39SS: I'm a big boy.
Sekou: I'm a big boy. 13:41SS: I'm a soldier.
Sekou: I'm a soldier. 13:43SS: I'm a warrior.
Sekou: I'm a warrior. 13:44SS: I am Sekou.
Sekou: I am Sekou. 13:46(Cheers and applause) 13:52ER: Good job, baby."

for something called a 360 review. 00:05(Laughter) 00:08If you've ever worked
in the corporate world, you probably have heard
of this diabolical exercise. 00:13(Laughter) 00:15It’s an anonymous survey with
your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense
of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy
version of a 360 review. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28Which included my wife, my brother
and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave
hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start
by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought
was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers
and spin instructors, so -- 05:05(Laughter) 05:07And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons
emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart
and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" 05:17(Laughter) 05:19Hard pass. 05:20(Laughter) 05:21Pasadena. I was not going to do that. 05:24But over the ensuing days
of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons
were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing
glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss
about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing
my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose
and rugged good looks. 05:46(Laughter) 05:47And in the face of all of this
roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche
of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably
self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves
and a retractable jaw. 06:06After about five or six days
of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going
to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude,
I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing,
but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based
neurotic programs, probably injected into me
by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism
trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them,
they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive
extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. 07:03Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment,
we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend
Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish
and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. 07:19(Laughter) 07:21It's OK, sweetie.
You're good at so many other things. 07:23(Laughter) 07:25(Applause) 07:29I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing
I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you
don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with
your level of productivity or you have failed
to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. 07:51The vastly superior alternative
is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. 07:59(Laughter) 08:01As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned
how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships
with other people. And because relationships
are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood,
not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better
at loving other people. And the flip side of this
was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which
I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships
with other people. And as those relationships
suffered, so did I. 08:40Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur
unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” 08:51(Laughter) 08:53That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious
about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term
because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children
to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause)"

to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause)"
2,What you can learn from people who disagree with you,Shreya Joshi,Oct 2022,"Youth leader Shreya Joshi diagnoses a key source of political polarization in the US and shows why having ""uncomfortable conversations"" with people you disagree with is crucial to bridging the divide. ""When we are able to recognize what unites us, it becomes so much easier to have conversations about what divides us,"" she says.", (27K),"Transcript (2 Languages)Englishالعربية00:00OK, guys, let's go back to high school. Does anyone remember that feeling of walking into the school cafeteria
with your tray in your hand and not knowing where to sit? Yeah, I see some people nodding, OK, cool. You might have sat alone, or perhaps more likely, you looked for someone who felt familiar. You sat with a group of people
that reminded you of you. And even today,
when deciding where to sit, how many of you
chose to sit next to someone who looked or felt different from you? I would bet that not many of you did that. I guess not much changes
in some situations, whether you're 17 or you're 70. 00:49We've all likely felt this tendency
to gravitate towards people who look, think and act like us. It's comfortable,
but it can also be harmful because this polarization
that we face today isn't just about believing
that the other side is factually wrong. We are beginning to see the other side
as malevolent beings with a hateful and hidden agenda. And you can see this. You can see this in the screaming
cable news pundits, the politicians who vote down bills just because they come
from the other side of the aisle. The hate groups
that violently attack people who are different from themselves. 01:30When I see these things as a teenager, I just feel so sad, so angry and so scared of this world that I'm soon going
to be entering as an adult. But there's something that I found
in having conversations with my peers that I think can be a path forward
from all of this. An approach that focuses on conversations with the intent to listen and learn. Not to win and not to agree. 01:59So I'm a 17-year-old
from Naperville, Illinois. In the summer before my sophomore
year of high school, I attended the ACLU National Advocacy
Institute's high school program in Washington, DC. During this program, I had the chance to take part in a lot
of different political discussions. And I remember this one conversation
about the death penalty in particular. So back then, I wholeheartedly believed
in this meaning of an eye for an eye. That punishment should be equal
to the offense because, you know, that's what I grew up hearing. And so I argued the same. I was, however, met
with immediate opposition. My peers told me that the death penalty
is state sanctioned murder and that it reinforces the very behavior
that it's trying to suppress. I tried arguing that the death
penalty deters crime, but then my peers told me that in states
without the death penalty, the murder rate is actually
significantly lower. I then tried arguing that the death
penalty brings closure for the victim's families, only to be told that the length
between sentencing and execution actually puts the victim's families
through an agonizing wait period. So by this point, I realized
that this debate -- Not going all that great for me. I realized that my
perspective was inherited, and this is when I decided
to stop trying to win the debate, and instead I just listened. 03:33And in the months that followed,
I took it upon myself to learn more. I pored over articles and data from sources ranging
from the more liberal, like the Brennan Center for Justice, to the more conservative,
like The Heritage Foundation. And I learned that historically, capital punishment has been
disproportionately applied to people of color. And that the death penalty
isn’t actually proven to deter crime. Slowly, my thinking changed. And this change only happened because I engaged with people
who had opposing perspectives. You know, it's hard to break out
of your own echo chamber because most of the time we don't realize
that we're even in one until we're out of it. But this was my first step. 04:21So shortly after this experience, I started a nonpartisan initiative
called Project TEAL to encourage and empower
high school students to become politically involved. We discuss a lot of different issues
like education equity, voter suppression, racial justice. And I've seen some amazing things happen when people just talk to one another. Understanding and accepting
of our differences. 04:48I actually remember this one conversation
in the summer of 2020. There was a boy and a girl
who were debating the merit of the Black Lives
Matter movement. And I remember being afraid that their conversation
would evolve into an argument. But it didn't. Instead, I learned
that the girl, who is Black, came from a family that had been through a couple
of rough instances with the police. And the boy, who was the son of a cop, came from an upbringing in which BLM was labeled
as a movement in defiance of the police. Later on, I was surprised to learn
that, though they still didn't agree, the boy and the girl learned something about the other
that they didn't know before. And more than that, they appreciated how it shaped the other person's
unique perspective. And this was only possible because they didn't delve
into a shouting match or call each other disrespectful names. And for me, this was an “aha!” moment. I realized that we shouldn't back away
from discussing polarizing issues, even if it's with people
who disagree with us. Sure, it's uncomfortable, and yeah, I'd probably agree that we don't change our minds
most of the time. But we can better understand
opposing perspectives, which can help us to better advocate
for our own beliefs. And maybe, just maybe, it even allows us to reach a compromise when the situation demands it. 06:16So I think the question remains. How can we create space
for this kind of bipartisan discourse? Well, I think the first step
is finding a community. When I think back
to my experience in the ACLU, I think the reason we were able
to have that civil discourse was because we recognized
that we were a part of a greater cause. And it's because my peers knew me, not just as an opposing voice, but as Shreya, their peer, their fellow
teen activist and their friend. And when we are able
to recognize what unites us, it becomes so much easier
to have conversations about what divides us. And most Americans actually validate
what I have seen in practice. While 77 percent of American voters polled before the 2020
presidential election said that they had just a few
or no close friends who supported the other side's candidate, 79 percent of Americans agree that creating opportunities
for bipartisan civil discourse would be effective in reducing divisions. Seventy-nine percent. That's pretty incredible, if you ask me. 07:28We all have affinity groups
that we can join. Maybe it's a friend group
at your place of work, a book club at the local library
or the PTA at your kid's school. Whatever this group is, try to have an uncomfortable conversation
with them at least once a week. Now, OK, what exactly constitutes
as uncomfortable? I would say that's really
up for you to decide. It can be about politics, sure. Or it can be about a different
topic entirely, like religion or identity. Whatever this topic may be, just talk about something
that’s uncomfortable, unconventional and meaningful to you. And most importantly, do it with the intent to listen and learn, not to win and not to agree. And you know, another tip. Make sure to stay off of your phone
for this conversation. Yeah. You know, as someone
who's pretty much obsessed with TikTok, I completely understand how addicting
social media can be. Believe me. But by discussing polarizing
issues online, we lose that person-to-person connection that really humanizes
opposing perspectives, that allows us to see
and empathize with one another. Because by having these conversations, you will gain insight into people
who think differently than you do. And who knows, maybe
you'll convince someone of a belief that you hold dearly, or maybe you'll even be moved
to reconsider your own viewpoint. 09:03In a month's time, I'm going to be
graduating from high school. 09:06(Applause) 09:11Over the past four years, I’ve learned a lot about creating
positive discourse, but I’m still scared of this polarization, this growing unwillingness to view
those who politically disagree with us as human. Honestly, it's a little overwhelming to think that I'm soon
going to enter this reality where I'll be confronted
with this division. Where I’ll be stereotyped and judged
by my ideology, my identity and my way of thinking by people
who don't even know the real me. As a teenager, it's a lot. And I know that many of my fellow
Gen Zers feel the exact same way. And this is precisely why addressing
this polarization crisis is so urgent and demands action from all of us. 10:02Just for one moment, go back to that high school cafeteria, But this time you sit down
with that other crowd. The kids who didn't look
or think like you do. And just imagine
what you could have learned. 10:17Thank you. 10:18(Applause)"

place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. 00:20If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. 00:29She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. 00:39And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. 00:56We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. 01:08If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. 01:34Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. 02:11Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. 03:15In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step."

watching my father raise the pistol to my mother's head. She pleaded with him to put the gun down, but he ignored her. When she bolted toward the door,
he followed close behind and once outside,
he fired one single shot. I was 12. I remember this moment frame by frame. I remember feeling numb. I remember feeling alone. 00:34Thank God, the bullet missed her, but my family would never be the same. I would never be the same. I didn't know then all the ways that my parents' on-again,
off-again relationship would impact me, but I knew I didn't want
a love like theirs. My story would be different. 00:57Years later, when I met you, I fell madly in love. Our connection was undeniable. It was as if you had been
hand-picked just for me. I thought we'd be together forever. But we struggled with some
of the same issues my parents had, and after nearly nine years together, we called it quits. 01:19We had Sekou then. He was only three. Though he was too young
to really understand what was going on, he was old enough to know that mommy and daddy were not going to be living
in the same house anymore. 01:33Our breakup hit me really hard. But I decided I wouldn't let my broken heart
get in the way of what was best for Sekou. We struggled initially,
trying to navigate this new space as co-parents. I asked myself, how do we raise this beautiful boy
full of wonder and promise and so much power, in spite of our failures as a couple? The answer for me was simple. I could either choose fear, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, or choose love. And I chose love. That means seeing
the good in you as a father. It means seeing
the good in you as a father and not your missteps as a partner. It means putting Sekou first every time, even if it means I don't get my way. 02:33I know my parents went back and forth trying to work things out
for my brother and I's sake. Though I appreciate their effort, I wish they hadn't. I saw too much, I heard too much. I knew I didn't want
that to be Sekou's story. I wanted Sekou to know what it was like to see
two parents who got along, two parents who worked together as a team. I wanted him to know what love looks like in its truest form. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not anger easily, it keeps no wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres. 03:25Shaka Senghor: It was 1983. I was 11 years old. I remember being in a basement
with my father, in our home on the east side of Detroit. I watched him stuff albums into the blue and orange milk crates, as tears streamed from his eyes. Just before that, him and my mother had just sat me and my siblings down and told us that they
were calling it quits. Thirty years later, I found myself with tears in my eyes, as I packed my belongings in our home. 04:11Ebony and I met while I was serving
a 19-year prison sentence. For four years, we used letters, phone calls and visits to build what we had imagined
to be an unshakeable bond. We fought the system together, and we thought that we would be able
to right the wrongs of our parents. She was a poet, I was a writer. She was gorgeous, with a PhD. I was handsome, with a GED. 04:49(Laughter) 04:53We built something magical. We built something
that we thought would endure. But unfortunately, our relationship became unhinged
when I was released from prison. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, trauma from prior to going to prison, baggage from her relationship, my inexperience in a relationship undid the magic of what we built
behind the walls. Centered in all of that was our beautiful boy. 05:32I remember when we first
brought Sekou home. It was so exciting, it was amazing, we worked together, we collaborated, we supported each other. You took the night shift,
I took the morning shift. And it was going amazing. And then it all changed. It changed the morning that you came in
really excited, you was like, ""Hey, I'm going back to work! Aren't you excited?"" And I was like, ""Yes.
I am ecstatic right now. 06:02(Laughter) 06:03I cannot be more delighted."" But inside, I was really afraid. But I couldn't tell you that. So instead, I said, ""Hey, go off and have a wonderful day."" 06:20And you left, and I was left with Sekou. What I understand now about that moment is that we were fostering a trust that's necessary for parents to coexist. And that you were trusting me
with our most precious gift. And that you were building the foundation
and the blocks for what's important for this portal we call parenthood. 06:48ER: Knowing how our parents'
breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising
a black boy in a society that says that black boys,
black bodies and black lives only seen as profitable or disposable. And then there's the other side. Possibility of two parents
who are no longer together coexisting, supporting each other, loving each other,
showing affection publicly in a way that honors
the relationship with our son. And even more importantly is the power to support each other
in all those vulnerable moments. 10:43There was this one time that it was my day to go pick up Sekou,
you remember that time? I go pick Sekou up, he's in first grade, and as I'm walking up, another parent walks up
and says, ""Hey, Shaka. I seen Oprah Winfrey
give a shout-out to you on CNN last night."" She was super excited, exuberant even. I was mortified. Because I thought, what's going to happen
when she tells another parent, and they tell another parent, and then they go and look me up and then they discover that I was in prison
for second-degree murder. And then their child hears about it. And they come to school,
and they say to Sekou, ""Your dad was convicted
of murdering someone."" And I remember,
as watching Sekou race out, and I knew that I had to call Ebony. When I called her,
I explained to her what happened, Ebony said, ""You have to have the talk."" 11:44So I took Sekou home, got him ready for bed, and we talked for half an hour. I talked to him
about why I went to prison. And I listened to his feedback. And then we called his mom
so we can do our nightly ritual of her offering prayer and then me doing affirmations. And I remember holding him tightly. And I realized the importance
of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.
Sekou: I'm amazing. 13:28SS: I am thoughtful.
Sekou: I am thoughtful. 13:31SS: I am kind.
Sekou: I am kind. 13:32SS: I am loving.
Sekou: I am loving. 13:34SS: I am caring.
Sekou: I am caring. 13:35SS: I am funny.
Sekou: I am funny. 13:37SS: I'm smart.
Sekou: I'm smart. 13:39SS: I'm a big boy.
Sekou: I'm a big boy. 13:41SS: I'm a soldier.
Sekou: I'm a soldier. 13:43SS: I'm a warrior.
Sekou: I'm a warrior. 13:44SS: I am Sekou.
Sekou: I am Sekou. 13:46(Cheers and applause) 13:52ER: Good job, baby."
2,"How to co-parent as allies, not adversaries",Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor,Apr 2020,"When Shaka Senghor and Ebony Roberts ended their relationship, they made a pact to protect their son from its fallout. What resulted was a poetic meditation on what it means to raise a child together, yet apart. In this moving and deeply personal talk, Senghor and Roberts share their approach to co-parenting -- an equal, active partnership that rolls with the punches and revels in the delights of guiding their child through the world with thought and intention.", (65K),"Transcript (16 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)日本語한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:01Ebony Roberts: I remember
watching my father raise the pistol to my mother's head. She pleaded with him to put the gun down, but he ignored her. When she bolted toward the door,
he followed close behind and once outside,
he fired one single shot. I was 12. I remember this moment frame by frame. I remember feeling numb. I remember feeling alone. 00:34Thank God, the bullet missed her, but my family would never be the same. I would never be the same. I didn't know then all the ways that my parents' on-again,
off-again relationship would impact me, but I knew I didn't want
a love like theirs. My story would be different. 00:57Years later, when I met you, I fell madly in love. Our connection was undeniable. It was as if you had been
hand-picked just for me. I thought we'd be together forever. But we struggled with some
of the same issues my parents had, and after nearly nine years together, we called it quits. 01:19We had Sekou then. He was only three. Though he was too young
to really understand what was going on, he was old enough to know that mommy and daddy were not going to be living
in the same house anymore. 01:33Our breakup hit me really hard. But I decided I wouldn't let my broken heart
get in the way of what was best for Sekou. We struggled initially,
trying to navigate this new space as co-parents. I asked myself, how do we raise this beautiful boy
full of wonder and promise and so much power, in spite of our failures as a couple? The answer for me was simple. I could either choose fear, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, or choose love. And I chose love. That means seeing
the good in you as a father. It means seeing
the good in you as a father and not your missteps as a partner. It means putting Sekou first every time, even if it means I don't get my way. 02:33I know my parents went back and forth trying to work things out
for my brother and I's sake. Though I appreciate their effort, I wish they hadn't. I saw too much, I heard too much. I knew I didn't want
that to be Sekou's story. I wanted Sekou to know what it was like to see
two parents who got along, two parents who worked together as a team. I wanted him to know what love looks like in its truest form. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not anger easily, it keeps no wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres. 03:25Shaka Senghor: It was 1983. I was 11 years old. I remember being in a basement
with my father, in our home on the east side of Detroit. I watched him stuff albums into the blue and orange milk crates, as tears streamed from his eyes. Just before that, him and my mother had just sat me and my siblings down and told us that they
were calling it quits. Thirty years later, I found myself with tears in my eyes, as I packed my belongings in our home. 04:11Ebony and I met while I was serving
a 19-year prison sentence. For four years, we used letters, phone calls and visits to build what we had imagined
to be an unshakeable bond. We fought the system together, and we thought that we would be able
to right the wrongs of our parents. She was a poet, I was a writer. She was gorgeous, with a PhD. I was handsome, with a GED. 04:49(Laughter) 04:53We built something magical. We built something
that we thought would endure. But unfortunately, our relationship became unhinged
when I was released from prison. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, trauma from prior to going to prison, baggage from her relationship, my inexperience in a relationship undid the magic of what we built
behind the walls. Centered in all of that was our beautiful boy. 05:32I remember when we first
brought Sekou home. It was so exciting, it was amazing, we worked together, we collaborated, we supported each other. You took the night shift,
I took the morning shift. And it was going amazing. And then it all changed. It changed the morning that you came in
really excited, you was like, ""Hey, I'm going back to work! Aren't you excited?"" And I was like, ""Yes.
I am ecstatic right now. 06:02(Laughter) 06:03I cannot be more delighted."" But inside, I was really afraid. But I couldn't tell you that. So instead, I said, ""Hey, go off and have a wonderful day."" 06:20And you left, and I was left with Sekou. What I understand now about that moment is that we were fostering a trust that's necessary for parents to coexist. And that you were trusting me
with our most precious gift. And that you were building the foundation
and the blocks for what's important for this portal we call parenthood. 06:48ER: Knowing how our parents'
breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising

2,Why domestic violence victims don't leave,Leslie Morgan Steiner,Jan 2013,"Leslie Morgan Steiner was in ""crazy love"" -- that is, madly in love with a man who routinely abused her and threatened her life. Steiner tells the story of her relationship, correcting misconceptions many people hold about victims of domestic violence, and explaining how we can all help break the silence.", (224K),"Transcript (41 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolEuskaraFrançaisFrançais canadienHrvatskiItalianoKiswahiliLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenščinaSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάМонголРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทยქართული中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Joseph Geni, TranslatorMorton Bast, Reviewer00:00I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question, which has an equally disturbing answer. My topic is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks: Why does she stay? Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her? I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. 00:31I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment, my first little green American Express card, and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate, many, many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love, a psychological trap disguised as love, one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. It may even be your story. 01:28I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College, an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. (Laughter) 01:57So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races, all religions, all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women, that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. 02:37I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me, but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was 22, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the United States. 03:11I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns. 03:19I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway, and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school, and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair, and he seemed so sweet. 03:54One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. We started dating, and he loved everything about me, that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman, in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. If you had told me that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup, how short my skirts were, where I lived, what jobs I took, who my friends were and where I spent Christmas, I would have laughed at you, because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. 05:40I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce, ""You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great, but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you"" — (Laughter) — ""so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises."" Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day, his dream job, and he said that he had quit his job because of me, because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family, and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York, and my dream job, but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate, so I agreed, and I quit my job, and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love, that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical, financial and psychological trap. 07:09The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed, and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me, and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me, my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. 07:57Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment, and I got frustrated, and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream, and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded, and I put on my mother's wedding dress, and I married him. 08:40Despite what had happened, I was sure we were going to live happily ever after, because I loved him, and he loved me so much. And he was very, very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident, and he was never going to hurt me again. 09:04It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost, and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon, he got frustrated by traffic, and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. 09:35I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life, and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year, 15 million. So actually, I was in very good company. 09:58Back to my question: Why did I stay? The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stairs, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway, poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview, I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. 10:40The other question everybody asks is, why doesn't she just leave? Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask, because we victims know something you usually don't: It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship, after she's gotten out, because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries; denial of financial resources; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children, who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave? 11:49I was able to leave, because of one final, sadistic beating that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, total strangers, and I'm here today because you all helped me. 12:22We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods. The question, ""Why does she stay?"" is code for some people for, ""It's her fault for staying,"" as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. 12:46But since publishing ""Crazy Love,"" I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened, and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives -- as employees, wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man, and we have those three kids. I have that black lab, and I have that minivan. What I will never have again, ever, is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. 13:39Right now, maybe you're thinking, ""Wow, this is fascinating,"" or, ""Wow, how stupid was she,"" but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter, your sister, your best friend right now. 14:14I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims, and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children, your coworkers, your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene, deescalate it, show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. 15:29Thank you. 15:31(Applause)"
2,How peer educators can transform sex education,Thea Holcomb,Feb 2019,"Where are teens supposed to learn about sex, asks student speaker Thea Holcomb. From alarmist imagery about sexually transmitted diseases? From the Internet and all its attendant judgment, bias and dysfunction? The answer, she suggests, lies with peer educators. In this talk, Holcomb explains why properly trained peer educators are the right people to disseminate both accurate information and healthy attitudes. As she says, ""When you get accurate, judgment-free information from yo...", (9.7K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishEspañolPortuguês brasileiroРусскийالعربيةDang Nguyen, TranslatorPeter Van de Ven, Reviewer00:02Greetings audience,
I'm Thea, I'm a high school student, and today we're going to talk about sex. [It won't be too scary.] Operating on the assumption you're human,
you've certainly heard of sex. In case you haven't, 
to get you up to speed, sex is the process
by which many organisms ensure their continued existence. Here's the thing though: sex is more complicated than that because - spoiler alert! -
humans are complicated. So how do we learn about sex
if it's so complicated? You might remember
sex education like this: [Don't have sex;
you will get PREGNANT and die.] Urban Dictionary - your source
for news and information about the 21st century zeitgeist -
describes sex education as:
 "".. where they try to
scare you out of having sex with pictures of diseased genitals..."" A more hopeful description
of sex education would be something like: a lifelong process of learning
about sex and sexuality, exploring values and beliefs
and gaining skills to navigate relationships
and manage your sexual health. This, as far as I'm concerned,
is a solid definition. So what can we do to make
sex education something that teens find
actually, like, educational. Clearly, teens need answers
to their questions. Where do people go
when they have questions? [The Internet] Listen, I love the Internet. It's one of the greatest developments
in human information exchange. [Yes. Thanks Internet.] But what it says about sexual health is not accurate by any
stretch of the imagination or is so laden with bias that it feels
more like being pelted with judgement than actually receiving information. Unfortunately, not every teen
is willing and able to chat it up with
their parents about sex. So if not always the Internet,
where can teens turn? Enter the peer educator. People my age do, indeed,
talk to each other about sex. So when teens are sources
of accurate information, it spreads among us quickly. As a peer educator, I belong to a program that gives me the tools
to learn about everything from STIs and safe sex
to contraception and consent. Basically, I can tell you more about
human sexuality than the average adult. When teens see someone like me
instead of someone older, they're quite open to the information
I have to offer them. At lunch once, some friends
wanted to know the difference between hormonal and copper IUDs. So I brought this to the table. Another day, my teacher didn't understand
how emergency contraception works. So I explained it to the class. What does it look like when teens
ask me questions about sexual health? It goes something like this. Venereal disease, STD, STI?
This terminology, it baffles me. STI stands for sexually
transmitted infection. We used to say STD, which stood
for sexually transmitted disease, but it was changed recently because STI is a more
medically accurate term, and taking away
the big scary word ""disease"" helps decrease stigma. What the heck is trichomoniasis? Well, trichomoniasis is a STI usually
spread through vaginal intercourse. It's curable with just
one dose of an oral drug. Common symptoms,
regardless of a person's sex, are unusual discharge,
painful urination and itching. But it spreads really quickly because most of the time
it's asymptomatic, which means people
don't realize they have it. That's why it's so important
to get tested regularly. Is it OK to be gay? Yes, all people of all identities
and backgrounds, including on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, can live healthy and productive lives. Regardless of your beliefs, everyone has the right to explore
and express their sexuality without the fear of shame or judgement. Thanks! So often, when my peers approach me
with questions like these, seeking this or that piece of information, at least a sliver of what they're
wondering is: ""Am I normal?"" So let's talk about normal. Part of the point of peer education is to give teens
the opportunity to understand that there is no such thing
as the elusive ""normal."" Peer educators are here to say
they're armed with information that empowers you
to make informed decisions; you are going to be OK. ""Normal"" isn't really necessary. When you can get accurate, judgement-free information
from your peers, you realize that sex-ed
doesn't have to be scary. So instead of striving to be normal, let's talk to each other. Since peer education allows sex-ed
to reach the community in ways that go far beyond
pictures of diseased genitals, it turns out to be pretty brilliant. An idea that, unlike trichomoniasis,
is certainly worth spreading."
2,An ode to envy,Parul Sehgal,Oct 2013,"What is jealousy? What drives it, and why do we secretly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its ""loneliness, longevity, grim thrill"" -- that is, says Parul Sehgal, except for fiction. In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge.", (73K),"Transcript (31 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well. 01:22And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no ""Odyssey."" No jealous king, no ""Arabian Nights."" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing ""Sound and the Fury,"" we're losing ""Gatsby,"" ""Sun Also Rises,"" we're losing ""Madame Bovary,"" ""Anna K."" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, ""In Search of Lost Time,"" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable. 03:41Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood. 04:32In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, ""Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now."" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his ""collection of instruments in his private torture chamber."" 05:23Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. 05:42And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, ""You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument."" He says, ""They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value."" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, ""A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us."" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity? 07:34Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. 08:10The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. 09:25Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. 10:11But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy? 10:31Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, ""We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you."" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. 11:39It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. 12:19But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

2,The beauty and complexity of finding common ground,Matt Trombley,Jun 2020,"How can we disagree with one another, respectfully and productively? In this thoughtful talk, team builder Matt Trombley reflects on ""agonism"" -- the tendency to take a rigid stance on issues -- and shares why finding aspects of agreement can be the first step in resolving conflict. ""When you can find even the smallest bit of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person,"" he says.", (18K),"Transcript (17 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeΕλληνικάالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorKrystian Aparta, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:01So our story started several years ago, when my wife and I
got a complaint letter in the mail from an anonymous neighbor. 00:09(Laughter) 00:11I'll never forget the way
my wife transformed before my eyes from this graceful, peaceful, sweet woman into just an angry mother grizzly bear
whose cubs needed to be protected. It was intense. So here's what happened. 00:28This is our family. This is my wife and I
and our five awesome kids. We're pretty loud,
we're pretty rambunctious, we're us. You'll notice, though,
that two of our children look a little different than Mary and I, and that's because they came to us
through adoption. Our neighbor, though,
saw two different-looking children playing outside of our house every day and came to the conclusion that we must have been running
an illegal day care out of our home. 00:54(Murmuring) 00:57We were really angry to have
our children stereotyped like that, but I know that's a relatively
minor example of racial profiling. But isn't it sometimes
what we all tend to do with people who think differently, or believe differently
or maybe even vote differently? Instead of engaging as true neighbors, we keep our distance and our actions towards those are guided by who we think
sees the world as we do or who we think doesn't. 01:28footnotefootnoteSee, what my neighbor suffered from
is a condition called agonism. And sometimes we all suffer
from the same condition. It's not a medical condition,
but it is contagious. So let's talk a little bit
about what agonism is. My favorite definition of agonism is taking a warlike stance
in contexts that are not literally war. Agonism comes from the same
Greek root word ""agon"" from which we get ""agony."" How very appropriate. We all tend to show symptoms of agonism when we hold on
to two deeply held beliefs, first identified by author Rick Warren. The first one is that if love someone, we must agree with all they do or believe. And the second is the inverse, that if we disagree with someone, it must mean that we fear or we hate them. 02:25Not sure we really recognize the agony
this way of thinking brings to us, when our relationships die because we think
we have to agree or disagree no matter what. Think about the conversations
we've had around Brexit, or Hong Kong, maybe Israeli settlements
or perhaps impeachment. I bet we could all think
of at least one personal relationship that's been strained or maybe even ended
because of these topics, or tragically, over a topic much more trivial than those. The cure for agonism is not out of reach. The question is how. 03:06So might I suggest two strategies that my experience
has taught me to start with. First, cultivate common ground, which means focusing on what we share. I want you to know I'm using my words
very, very deliberately. By ""cultivate,"" I mean
we have to intentionally work to find common ground with someone. Just like a farmer works
to cultivate the soil. And common ground is a common term, so let me at least explain
what I don't mean, which is I don't mean by common ground
that we were exact, or that we totally agree and approve. All I mean is that we find
one unifying thing that we can have in a relationship
in common with another person. 03:52You know, sometimes
that one thing is hard to find. So I'd like to share a personal story, but before I do, let me tell you a little bit
more about myself. I'm Caucasian, cisgender male, middle class, evangelical Christian. And I know, as soon as some
of those words came out of my mouth, some of you had some perceptions about me. And it's OK, I know that not all
those perceptions are positive. But for those who share my faith, know that I'm about
to cut across the grain. And you may tune me out as well. So as we go, if you're having a hard time hearing me, I just gently ask that you reflect and see if you're buying into agonism. If you're rejecting me simply because you think
you see the world differently than I do, because isn't that
what we're here talking about? Alright, ready? 04:44So I've been thinking a lot
about how to find common ground in the area of gender fluidity, as an evangelical Christian. For Christians like me, we believe that God
created us man and woman. So what do I do? Do I throw up my hands and say, ""I can't have a relationship
with anybody who is transgender or LGBTQIA?"" No. That would be giving into agonism. 05:12footnotefootnoteSo I started looking
at the foundational aspects of my faith, the first of which is that of the three billion genes
that make us human -- and by the way, we share
99.9 percent of those genes -- that I believe those three billion genes
are the result of an intelligent designer. And that immediately gives me
common ground with anybody. What it also gives me ... is the belief that each
and every one of us have been given the right to life by that same intelligent designer. 05:50I dug deeper though. I found that my faith didn't teach me to start relationships
by arguing with somebody until they believed what I believed, or I convinced them. No, it taught me to start relationships by loving them as a coequal member
of the human race. Honestly though, some who share my faith draw a line and refuse to address somebody
by their preferred gender pronoun. But isn't that believing the lie
that in order for me to honor you, I have to give up what I believe? 06:25Come back in time with me -- let's say it's 20 years ago, and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep. And you open the door. Would you address him as Muhammad Ali or his former name of Cassius Clay? I'm guessing that most of you
would say Muhammad Ali. And I'm also guessing that most of you wouldn't think we'd have to
immediately convert to Islam, just by using his name. To honor him would cost me,
would cost any of us absolutely nothing, and it would give us the common ground
to have a relationship. And it's the relationship
that cures agonism, not giving up what we believe. 07:09So for me to honor my faith, it means rejecting
these rigid symptoms of agonism. Meaning, I can and I will love you. I can and I will accept you, and I don't have to buy into the lie that if I do these things,
I have to give up what I believe or chose to fear and hate you. Because I'm focusing
on what we have in common. 07:35When you can find even the smallest bit
of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand
just the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person. 07:53Our second strategy gives us room to (Inhales) breathe. To pause. To calm down. To have the kind of relationships
that cure agonism. And how to keep those relationships alive. Our second strategy is to exchange
extravagant grace. 08:18(Laughs) 08:20Once again, I'm not mincing words -- by grace, I don't mean
we should all go sign up for ballet, that would be weird. 08:25(Laughter) 08:27footnotefootnoteWhat I mean is not canceling
everything over one mistake. Even if that mistake
personally offended you. Maybe even deeply. Perhaps Holocaust survivor
Corrie ten Boom put it best when she said, ""To forgive is to set a prisoner free, only to realize that prisoner was me."" My faith teaches me that we humans
will never be perfect, myself very much included. So we need the grace of a savior, who for me is Jesus. And while I define grace
in the context of my faith, I know there's a lot of other people
who have defined it differently and in different ways. One of my favorites is radio broadcaster
Oswald Hoffmann, who said, ""Grace is the love that loves the unlovely and the unlovable."" And I just love that picture of grace. Because I know I am, and maybe a lot of you can think of a time when we're just pretty dadgum unlovable. 09:37So it would be the height of hypocrisy, dare I say repulsive to my faith, for me to accept the unconditional, unqualified
grace and love from God and then turn around and put one precondition
on the love I give you. What in the world would I be thinking? And by extravagant, I mean over the top, not just checking a box. We can all remember when we were kids and our parents forced us
to apologize to somebody and we walked up to them
and said, (Angrily) ""I'm sorry."" We just got it over with, right? That's not what we're talking about. What we're talking about
is not having to give someone grace but choosing to and wanting to. That's how we exchange extravagant grace. 10:31Listen, I know this can sound
really, really theoretical. So I'd like to tell you
about a hero of mine. A hero of grace. It's 2014. In Iran. And the mother of a murdered son
is in a public square. The man who murdered her son
is also in that square, by a gallows, on a chair of some kind, a noose around his neck and a blindfold over his eyes. Samereh Alinejad had been given the sole right
under the laws of her country to either pardon this man or initiate his execution. Put another way, she could pardon him or literally push that chair
out from underneath his feet. 11:25(Exhales) 11:27I just ... I can't picture the agony
going through both Samereh and this man at the time. Samereh with her choice to make, and this man, in the account
that I read, was just weeping, just begging for forgiveness. And Samereh had a choice. And she chose in that moment
to walk up to this man and to slap him right across the face. And that signaled her pardon. It gets better. 11:58Right afterwards, somebody asked her, they interviewed her,
and she was quoted as saying, ""I felt as if rage vanished
from within my heart and the blood in my veins
began to flow again."" Isn't that incredible? I mean, what a picture of grace,
what a hero of grace. And there's a lesson in there
for all of us. That as theologian John Piper said, ""Grace is power, not just pardon."" And if you think about it, grace is the gift we give
someone else in a relationship that says our relationship
is way more important than the things that separate us. And if you really think
about it some more, we all have the power to execute
in our relationships, or to pardon. 12:55We never did find out
the identity of our anonymous neighbor. 12:59(Laughter) 13:00But if we did, I'd hope we'd simply say, ""Can we have coffee?"" And maybe there's somebody
you need to have coffee with and find your common ground with them. Or maybe there's somebody
you're in a relationship with and you need to exchange
extravagant grace. Maybe go first. 13:21These two strategies have taught me how to exchange extravagant grace
in my relationships and to enjoy the beautiful design
of my neighbors. I want to continue to choose
relationships over agonism. Will you choose to join me? 13:40Thank you. 13:41(Applause)"
2,What young women believe about their own sexual pleasure,Peggy Orenstein,Mar 2017,"Why do girls feel empowered to engage in sexual activity but not to enjoy it? For three years, author Peggy Orenstein interviewed girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes toward and experiences of sex. She discusses the pleasure that's largely missing from their sexual encounters and calls on us to close the ""orgasm gap"" by talking candidly with our girls from an early age about sex, bodies, pleasure and intimacy.", (132K),"Transcript (27 Languages)CatalàEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenščinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийбългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00For several years now, we've been engaged in a national debate
about sexual assault on campus. No question -- it's crucial that young people
understand the ground rules for consent, but that's where the conversation
about sex is ending. And in that vacuum of information the media and the Internet -- that new digital street corner -- are educating our kids for us. If we truly want young people
to engage safely, ethically, and yes, enjoyably, it's time to have open honest discussion
about what happens after ""yes,"" and that includes breaking
the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women's capacity for
and entitlement to sexual pleasure. Yeah. 00:52(Applause) 00:53Come on, ladies. 00:54(Applause) 00:56I spent three years
talking to girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes
and experience of sex. And what I found was that while young women may feel
entitled to engage in sexual behavior, they don't necessarily
feel entitled to enjoy it. Take this sophomore
at the Ivy League college who told me, ""I come from a long line
of smart, strong women. My grandmother was a firecracker, my mom is a professional, my sister and I are loud,
and that's our form of feminine power."" She then proceeded
to describe her sex life to me: a series of one-off hookups, starting when she was 13, that were ... not especially responsible, not especially reciprocal and not especially enjoyable. She shrugged. ""I guess we girls are just socialized
to be these docile creatures who don't express our wants or needs."" ""Wait a minute,"" I replied. ""Didn't you just tell me
what a smart, strong woman you are?"" She hemmed and hawed. ""I guess,"" she finally said, ""no one told me that that smart,
strong image applies to sex."" 02:05I should probably say right up top
that despite the hype, teenagers are not engaging in intercourse
more often or at a younger age than they were 25 years ago. They are, however,
engaging in other behavior. And when we ignore that, when we label that as ""not sex,"" that opens the door
to risky behavior and disrespect. That's particularly true of oral sex, which teenagers consider
to be less intimate than intercourse. Girls would tell me, ""it's no big deal,"" like they'd all read
the same instruction manual -- at least if boys
were on the receiving end. Young women have lots
of reasons for participating. It made them feel desired; it was a way to boost social status. Sometimes, it was a way
to get out of an uncomfortable situation. As a freshman at a West Coast
college said to me, ""A girl will give a guy a blow job
at the end of the night because she doesn't
want to have sex with him, and he expects to be satisfied. So, if I want him to leave and I don't want anything to happen ... "" I heard so many stories
of girls performing one-sided oral sex that I started asking, ""What if every time
you were alone with a guy, he told you to get him
a glass of water from the kitchen, and he never got you a glass of water -- or if he did, it was like ... 'you want me to uh ...?'"" You know, totally begrudging. You wouldn't stand for it. 03:38But it wasn't always
that boys didn't want to. It was that girls didn't want them to. Girls expressed a sense of shame
around their genitals. A sense that they were
simultaneously icky and sacred. Women's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked
to their enjoyment of sex. Yet, Debby Herbenick,
a researcher at Indiana University, believes that girls' genital
self-image is under siege, with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable
in their natural state. According to research, about three-quarters of college women
remove their pubic hair -- all of it -- at least on occasion, and more than half do so regularly. Girls would tell me that hair removal
made them feel cleaner, that it was a personal choice. Though, I kind of wondered
if left alone on a desert island, if this was how they would
choose to spend their time. 04:38(Laughter) 04:39And when I pushed further, a darker motivation emerged: avoiding humiliation. ""Guys act like they
would be disgusted by it,"" one young woman told me. ""No one wants to be
talked about like that."" The rising pubic hair removal
reminded me of the 1920s, when women first started regularly
shaving their armpits and their legs. That's when flapper dresses
came into style, and women's limbs were suddenly visible, open to public scrutiny. There's a way that I think
that this too is a sign. That a girl's most intimate part
is open to public scrutiny, open to critique, to becoming more about
how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her. 05:26The shaving trend has sparked
another rise in labiaplasty. Labiaplasty, which is the trimming
of the inner and outer labia, is the fastest-growing cosmetic
surgery among teenage girls. It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015, and whereas girls under 18 comprise
two percent of all cosmetic surgeries, they are five percent of labiaplasty. The most sought-after look, incidentally, in which the outer labia
appear fused like a clam shell, is called ... wait for it ... ""The Barbie."" 06:04(Groan) 06:06I trust I don't have to tell you that Barbie is a) made of plastic and b) has no genitalia. 06:14(Laughter) 06:16The labiaplasty trend
has become so worrisome that the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued a statement on the procedure, which is rarely medically indicated, has not been proven safe and whose side effects
include scarring, numbness, pain and diminished sexual sensation. Now, admittedly, and blessedly, the number of girls involved
is still quite small, but you could see them
as canaries in a coal mine, telling us something important
about the way girls see their bodies. 06:53Sara McClelland, a psychologist
at the University of Michigan, coined what is my favorite phrase ever
in talking about all of this: ""Intimate justice."" That's the idea that sex has political,
as well as personal implications, just like, who does
the dishes in your house, or who vacuums the rug. And it raises similar
issues about inequality, about economic disparity, violence, physical and mental health. Intimate justice asks us to consider who is entitled
to engage in an experience. Who is entitled to enjoy it? Who is the primary beneficiary? And how does each partner
define ""good enough""? Honestly, I think those questions
are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront, but when we're talking about girls, I just kept coming back to the idea
that their early sexual experience shouldn't have to be
something that they get over. 08:01In her work, McClelland found that young women
were more likely than young men to use their partner's pleasure
as a measure of their satisfaction. So they'd say things like, ""If he's sexually satisfied, then I'm sexually satisfied."" Young men were more likely to measure
their satisfaction by their own orgasm. Young women also defined
bad sex differently. In the largest ever survey ever conducted
on American sexual behavior, they reported pain
in their sexual encounters 30 percent of the time. They also used words like ""depressing,"" ""humiliating,"" ""degrading."" The young men never used that language. So when young women
report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to
or greater than young men's -- and they do in research -- that can be deceptive. If a girl goes into an encounter
hoping that it won't hurt, wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm, she'll be satisfied
if those criteria are met. And there's nothing wrong with wanting
to feel close to your partner, or wanting him to be happy, and orgasm isn't the only
measure of an experience ... but absence of pain -- that's a very low bar
for your own sexual fulfillment. 09:29Listening to all of this
and thinking about it, I began to realize that we performed
a kind of psychological clitoridectomy on American girls. Starting in infancy, parents of baby boys are more likely
to name all their body parts, at least they'll say,
""here's your pee-pee."" Parents of baby girls
go right from navel to knees, and they leave this whole
situation in here unnamed. 09:52(Laughter) 09:54There's no better way
to make something unspeakable than not to name it. Then kids go into
their puberty education classes and they learn that boys
have erections and ejaculations, and girls have ... periods and unwanted pregnancy. And they see that internal diagram
of a woman's reproductive system -- you know, the one that looks
kind of like a steer head -- 10:18(Laughter) 10:22And it always grays out between the legs. So we never say vulva, we certainly never say clitoris. No surprise, fewer than half
of teenage girls age 14 to 17 have ever masturbated. And then they go
into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow
they'll think sex is about them, that they'll be able to articulate
their needs, their desires, their limits. It's unrealistic. 10:52Here's something, though. Girls' investment
in their partner's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner. So in same-sex encounters, the orgasm gap disappears. And young women climax
at the same rate as men. Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated
to get off the script -- free to create an encounter
that worked for them. Gay girls also challenged
the idea of first intercourse as the definition of virginity. Not because intercourse isn't a big deal, but it's worth questioning
why we consider this one act, which most girls associate
with discomfort or pain, to be the line in the sand
of sexual adulthood -- so much more meaningful, so much more transformative
than anything else. And it's worth considering
how this is serving girls; whether it's keeping them
safer from disease, coercion, betrayal, assault. Whether it's encouraging
mutuality and caring; what it means about the way
they see other sex acts; whether it's giving them more control over and joy in their experience, and what it means about gay teens, who can have multiple sex partners
without heterosexual intercourse. So I asked a gay girl that I met, ""How'd you know
you weren't a virgin anymore?"" She said she had to Google it. 12:21(Laughter) 12:23And Google wasn't sure. 12:25(Laughter) 12:27She finally decided
that she wasn't a virgin anymore after she'd had
her first orgasm with a partner. And I thought -- whoa. What if just for a second we imagined that was the definition? Again, not because
intercourse isn't a big deal -- of course it is -- but it isn't the only big deal, and rather than thinking about sex
as a race to a goal, this helps us reconceptualize it
as a pool of experiences that include warmth, affection, arousal, desire, touch, intimacy. And it's worth asking young people: who's really the more sexually
experienced person? The one who makes out
with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual
tension and communication, or the one who gets wasted at a party
and hooks up with a random in order to dump their ""virginity""
before they get to college? 13:29The only way that shift
in thinking can happen though is if we talk to young people
more about sex -- if we normalize those discussions, integrating them into everyday life, talking about those intimate acts
in a different way -- the way we mostly have changed in the way that we talk
about women in the public realm. 13:51Consider a survey
of 300 randomly chosen girls from a Dutch and an American university, two similar universities, talking about their early
experience of sex. The Dutch girls embodied everything
we say we want from our girls. They had fewer negative consequences, like disease, pregnancy, regret -- more positive outcomes like being able to communicate
with their partner, who they said they knew very well; preparing for the experience responsibly; enjoying themselves. What was their secret? The Dutch girls said
that their doctors, teachers and parents talked to them candidly, from an early age, about sex, pleasure
and the importance of mutual trust. What's more, while American parents weren't necessarily
less comfortable talking about sex, we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms or risk and danger, whereas Dutch parents talk
about balancing responsibility and joy. I have to tell you, as a parent myself, that hit me hard, because I know, had I not delved into that research, I would have talked to my own child
about contraception, about disease protection, about consent because I'm a modern parent, and I would have thought ... job well done. 15:24Now I know that's not enough. I also know what I hope for for our girls. I want them to see sexuality
as a source of self-knowledge, creativity and communication, despite its potential risks. I want them to be able
to revel in their bodies' sensuality without being reduced to it. I want them to be able
to ask for what they want in bed, and to get it. I want them to be safe
from unwanted pregnancy, disease, cruelty, dehumanization, violence. If they are assaulted, I want them to have recourse
from their schools, their employers, the courts. It's a lot to ask, but it's not too much. 16:15As parents, teachers,
advocates and activists, we have raised a generation
of girls to have a voice, to expect egalitarian
treatment in the home, in the classroom, in the workplace. Now it's time to demand
that intimate justice in their personal lives as well. 16:39Thank you. 16:41(Applause)"
2,How compassion could save your strained relationships,Betty Hart,Mar 2021,"When personal relationships and ideological differences collide, the result can lead to strained relations -- or even years of silence and distance. Actor Betty Hart offers an alternative to cold shoulders and haughty hellos: compassion, and a chance for growth and change instead of losing important time with loved ones.", (48K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01I am unabashedly a daddy's girl. My daddy is the first person
to have told me that I was beautiful. He often told me that he loved me, and he was one of my favorite
people in the entire world, which was why it was really challenging to discover that we had
a deep ideological divide that was so sincere and so deep that caused me to not talk
to him for 10 years. Before the term was coined, I canceled my father. 00:45In the last few years, cancel culture has of course
come into great prominence. It's existed throughout time, but cancel culture in the bigger society is when a person in prominence
says or does something that we, the people, disagree with, and the decision is made
to make them persona non grata. They are done. They are not to be revered. They are not to be
a part of our world anymore. And that is in the public realm. I'm going to talk to you today
about the private realm. When we choose to cancel
the people in our circle, the people in our core, the people who love us and who we love, and it has been mutually beneficial, but due to a deep
and sincere ideological divide, we make the decision
to cancel them out of our lives. I want to suggest that
cancel culture needs to change, and instead we need to
move to compassion culture. 01:52But before I go there, let me tell you
two of the premises that exist when we indulge in cancel culture. One, we have to believe that we're right. A hundred percent, no possibility of being wrong. And two, the other person, the person we're going to cancel, clearly does not have the ability to change, to grow, to develop. 02:21Obviously, both of these are problematic because sometimes we're not right. I don't know about you,
but there have been times in my life when I knew beyond
a shadow of a doubt that I was right only to discover that I was wrong, badly wrong, completely missed the mark. So if it could happen to me
and perhaps it's happened to you, perhaps it could happen to others. 02:49The second is a little
even more challenging because I know that
I've changed over the years. Haven't we all? Though the core parts of Betty
have pretty much stayed the same, there have been key elements
that have changed drastically. The Betty of eight years old was
not the same as the Betty of 18, which was not the same as 28,
which was not the same as 38. I've changed. And if I'm able to change, shouldn't I extend grace
to believe that others can change too? 03:27So what should we do? Instead of canceling people,
we should use the tool called compassion. I find the definition of compassion
is a fascinating one. And it's not one
that I hear people talk about. Compassion means to suffer with someone. To suffer alongside them. Imagine. When someone, say, Grandpa, says that thing
that's caused you to decide he's no longer invited to Thanksgiving, what if instead we chose
to suffer alongside him? We decided that our love
was so big, so deep, so strong that we were willing to suffer, even when it could be potentially painful. 04:22Now let's be clear. I am not denying anyone's right
to cancel anyone else. What I'm suggesting is that
maybe that's not the best way. When we think about the situation
with Grandpa at Thanksgiving, if we choose to cancel him, we are no longer in proximity to him. Not only do we not get to hear
his point of view, we don't get to share ours. What if we're the only person, because of our deep connection and love
and affection for our grandfather -- and substitute anyone you choose. What if we're the ones
to plant seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of difference. Now, to be fair, I cannot promise you
that just because you plant the seed, that it will get water, that it'll get any sunlight
or even a little fertilizer. But what I can tell you
is that if you don't plant it, who will? 05:30I find it interesting, this idea of suffering alongside someone. It means that we are choosing
to value the totality of the person rather than one particular aspect, like a framework or a mindset
or a belief system. We're choosing to believe
that the entire person is more valuable than any of the individual parts. 05:56And I found an amazing duo
who demonstrated this beautifully. Perhaps you've heard of them. The late justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were close, close friends. And they were completely divided
in terms of belief systems. In fact, Antonin Scalia once said, ""What's not to like,
other than her thoughts on the law."" He believed she was wrong. She believed he was wrong. They did not shift
in that point of view whatsoever. And yet they had tea together every week, and every New Year's Eve, they spent it together
with their families. They went on family vacations together. They chose to suffer
with each other rather than to cancel each other. Their love and respect for each other continued to grow, even though they never saw eye to eye. 07:07I imagine that curiosity
might be a part of that. That if we choose to be curious
about that which is different, we might discover something along the way. After all, if we are who we are
because of our lived experiences, isn't that true for someone else? And have we ever decided
to use that tool of empathy, of walking a mile or so
in someone else's shoes to really discover the context
for why they believe what they believe? 07:39Now, by now you're probably saying, ""Yeah, OK, Betty, this sounds good. But what about you? What about you and your dad?"" It's a fair question. After 10 years of not talking to my dad, I picked up the phone one day,
called him and said, ""I bet if it were up to you, you'd probably go back in time
and change some things. I know I would. But since we can't, how about we start again?"" And he said, ""Yes, because I love you. I always have. And I always will."" I am so grateful that I made that call because there was no way for me to know that a few years later
my dad would develop Alzheimer's. And a few years after that he would die. And we never saw eye to eye
about the thing that divided us, ever. But our love continued. It continued through those 10 years
when we didn't speak and it continued in the six years after. 09:03So I am encouraging us
to become a society of people that choose compassion over canceling. I'm asking us to consider that curiosity might be a better practice. That we might choose empathy, that we might choose
to have a love that is so deep, so wide, so strong that it can surpass differences. Why are we so scared
of differences anyway? I also want us to be a people
that plant seeds, seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of diversity. Again, I cannot promise
to you or anyone else that planting that seed
is going to make a difference. But what if it does? I am the sum of who I am because of everything
that I've been exposed to. My mind has changed over the years and grown because of the people
in my life who planted seeds in me, some that I saw and some that I didn't. So wouldn't it be great if instead of having a cancel culture we create a compassion culture where we are willing to suffer
alongside the ones we love, because we love them. And can't we become
a community that plants seeds? After all, if we don't, who will? 10:47Thank you."
2,"How to discover your ""why"" in difficult times",Simon Sinek,May 2021,"What has the coronavirus pandemic taught us about ourselves and our relationships? In a deeply personal and wide-ranging conversation, leadership expert Simon Sinek shares his own experience caring for his mental health as the world shut down. He discusses why we need to nurture friendships (in both good times and bad), explains why anyone can be a leader -- and reveals the secret to discovering your ""why"" in life. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson, ...", (62K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiTiếng ViệtРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (繁體)한국어00:00Chris Anderson: Simon, I'll start us off
by saying, I mean, here we are, look, after a year of the pandemic, probably one of the most extraordinary
experiences any of us have had. What do you think the unexpected
psychological carryovers might be? I mean, do you think we've kind of -- Part of me thinks that people
have got more fragile, that it's almost like
there's a sort of learned timidity. Have you seen any evidence of that
or how would you characterize it? 00:29Simon Sinek: I think we've definitely
all become much more aware of mental health. And that it's a real thing and that mental health affects
strong and healthy people. We all suffered trauma during COVID. Some of us dealt with it earlier,
some of us dealt with it later, some of us are still dealing with it,
but nobody escapes it. When COVID first started, you know, many of us had to pivot our organizations, had to pivot our businesses very quickly. And so I, like many others,
we went into mission mode. And I called a friend of mine
who is active-duty military. And I asked him a very simple question, how do I compartmentalize my emotions
so that I can stay focused on the mission? And he gave me a very stern warning. He said, you can't. He said, we can compartmentalize our
emotions for only a short period of time, but no one, no one escapes
the trauma of combat. And he said, you may not even experience
the trauma while you're in it, you may not experience it when
you first come home, you may experience it months later. He says, I experience it four
or five months after I get home. So immediately I hung up the phone and called all my A-type
personality friends and said, OK, we think we're good, but we're going to get hit
by this at some point. And we made a deal that when we
started to feel off our game, we would call each other. Safe space. And we made another deal
that there would be no crying alone. That if you had to cry, you picked up
the phone and you called somebody. 01:56Well, about four or five
months into COVID, I started to feel off my game
and I didn't know what was going on. And so I called that same
friend in the military and I asked no leading questions. I simply asked him, tell me what your
symptoms are when you suffer the trauma when you come home from combat. And he said, well, number one,
he falls out of his sleep pattern. He said he starts going to bed
late for no reason and doesn't want to get up in the morning. And I thought to myself, yep. He says he has some unproductive days
and he comes up with an excuse like, ""It's OK, you know,
you deserve a rest. It's fine."" But then he has another
and another and another. And I thought to myself, yep. And he said he becomes very antisocial
where he doesn't want to ask for help and he definitely doesn't want
to talk to anybody. And I thought to myself, yep. And I realized what I was going
through was trauma. And I was afraid to use
the D-word, depression, for fear that that was some
sort of diagnosis. I think a lot of people
are afraid of that word, but that's exactly
what I was going through. I was going through 
lowercase “D” depression. And I followed the rule
that we set with our friends and I called people. Because one of the things
I asked my friend is like, how do you overcome it? He said, you have to force yourself
back into a sleep pattern and force yourself to call friends
and ask for help. 03:13And so I think one of the things, I think that comes out of COVID, is we recognized just the importance
of human connection. You know, in this fast-paced
digital world, we kidded ourselves to think
that we had connections just because we were connected. But it was amazing to see
when COVID started, regardless of someone's age
or a technological competency, we all picked up the phone. Like, young people
were talking to each other. And I think that intense craving
for a human voice and human touch, I think we were reminded just
how fragile we are as human beings. 03:49CA: That phrase you've mentioned,
""no crying alone,"" that's powerful. I mean, forgive me asking,
did you cry with someone? 03:56SS: Yes. I followed my own counsel to my friends. And when I had to cry,
when I was overwhelmed, I picked up the phone and I just cried. And I had friends call me and do the same. 04:12CA: And there was healing in that. 04:14SS: The most important thing
that came from it was that we didn't -- none of us felt alone. And there's intense safety. That amazing sense of safety
that we all desire as human beings. You know, you can't feel safe
when you're vulnerable, like, that's when we need it the most. But you have to build those relationships. You build those relationships
in the happy times, the good times, where you think you're strong,
you think you're great. It’s very hard to start
building those relationships in the moment of crisis. And I think it's a lesson
for leadership, quite frankly. Which is, you can't judge
the quality of a crew by how a ship performs in calm waters. You judge the quality of a crew
by how a ship performs in rough waters. But the time in calm waters is when you're building
relationship and trust and you don't really actually know
if you have trusting relationships and trusting teams
and loving relationships until the crisis strikes. And I heard this from a lot of people: When COVID happened, they commented on how they realized
who their real friends were. Some people kind of fell by the wayside,
it was nothing personal. It's just like, we didn't call each other
and we're still, you know, weren’t angry or anything. And there are some people who came out
of the woodwork to check in on us and those friendships flourished. And that's what I mean. It takes hardship for those friendships
and that trust to really bear fruit. But that's why we have to invest
in people when we're doing well and we don't think we need anybody. And I think we forget that. 05:49CA: What would you say
to someone who has realized that they're in this moment,
what's been a really difficult year, and they actually don't feel
that there's someone they could, for example, pick up the phone and cry with? Is it hopeless for them until this passes? Or what would you say to them? 06:09SS: There is an irony. There's an irony in when we need help. And when I was writing
the book ""Leaders Eat Last,"" I had the opportunity
to spend some time with and visit Alcoholics Anonymous. And it is a remarkable organization. And many of us are familiar
with the 12-step program. And many of us are familiar
with the first step, which is admitting you have a problem. But then it's the other 11 steps
that also matter. And Alcoholics Anonymous knows that if you master the first 11 steps, but not the 12th, you are likely to succumb to the disease. But if you master the 12 steps, you're more likely
to overcome the disease. That 12th step is to help
another alcoholic. It's service. And so there's a great irony
when we need help to actually help someone who's struggling
with the same thing as us. And it is the most
healing thing we can do. So, you know, if we need
someone to cry with, it's to offer the shoulder
for somebody else to cry with. If we're feeling lonely, it's to be there for someone else
who's struggling with loneliness. And this goes way beyond these subjects, which is if we're looking for love
to help somebody else find love, if we're looking for the job we love, to help somebody else
find the job that they love. And there's tremendous value in service. 07:26And you hear about these
things all the time, you talk to people why they chose to go
in the profession they went into, especially if they're in
the service profession, let's say somebody
is a counselor for trauma. And you say, why did you go
into this profession? ""When I was younger,
I suffered a trauma, and somebody was there to counsel me and I decided I wanted to commit
my life to doing that for others."" This is what happens with service. And we forget, just because we live
in a modern world, we're actually a very
old-fashioned machine. The human animal is a legacy machine
living in a modern world. And we still work the same way we used to. And we desperately need each other
to survive and thrive as much as we did
when we were living in huts in small tribes of 150 people. And so service service is the thing. 08:12CA: That sounds like, even for someone who's not feeling,
like, depressed or at the edge right now, but a good checklist-question to ask is, is there someone
I could reach out to actually, there maybe other people
who are in a much worse situation and maybe there is a call I could make that would be incredibly
valuable to that person and help build
a relationship with future? 08:30SS: ""Are you OK?"" ""How are you? You know, a friend of mine, George Flynn, he says his test for a leader is
if they ask you how you're doing, they actually care about the answer. And I really like that. 08:46CA: OK, I could talk with you
for hours about this, but we're going to go
to some questions now. So here's a question from Kayum. ""If there is no way to get back
to normal,"" as you said, ""then are we on the right path
of building new normal already? Or can you help us with a blueprint
that new normal should be based on?"" 09:04SS: So blueprint? No. Guidances? Yes. I think that humanity has to be -- We have to remember that humanity matters. And when I say humanity,
I don't mean big-H Humanity, I mean little-H humanity, our humanity. When COVID first happened, so many leaders leaned on their humanity, whether they were effective
or ineffective leaders prior to COVID, many of them picked up the phone
and said, ""Are you OK?"" They called their teams
just to check in on them. Or they called their friends to say,
""Are you OK? How are you?"" Well, we don't need a global
pandemic to do that. That's called good leadership and we should be doing that all the time. And we should be encouraging
those in our charge to do the same for those in their charge. You know, the hierarchy
can still be effective that way. I hope that remains. I hope that remains. I hope the use of the telephone remains. That we don't just go back
to texting all the time. I hope that putting our phones away
and having family dinner remains. I think there's a lot of kids that will actually come through this with stronger relationships
with their siblings if they have them, and stronger relationship
with their parents because they had so much time together. And kids who may have struggled prior because they weren't getting
the kind of attention they needed because their parents
were so busy with work, you know, even if mom or dad
are busy on a Zoom call all day, that hour that they would ordinarily
just go get a cup of coffee or something, that they could focus on their kid. I think a lot of kids
actually will come out of this. And kids are remarkably adaptable. They're remarkably adaptable. 10:47CA: Here’s a question from Mariusz. ""Could you give us some tips
on how to discover our Why?"" 10:54SS: Absolutely. I'll give you a little exercise
that you can do with your friends. It's called the Friends Exercise. Find a friend you love and who loves you. The person who, if they called you
at three o'clock in the morning, you take the call and you know
they would do the same for you. Do not do this with a sibling or a spouse. Do not do this with a parent. Those relationships are too close. Do it with a best friend. And go up to them
and ask the simple question, ""Why are we friends?"" And they're going to look at you
like you're crazy because you're asking them
to put into words a feeling. You're asking them to use
a part of the brain, the neocortex, that doesn't control feelings, and to put the thing that exists
in the limbic brain into language, which it doesn't do. And so it's actually
a very difficult question. They're going to say, ""I don't know."" It's not that they don't know,
it's that they can't put it into words. Ironically, you stop asking
the question why and you start asking the question, ""what""
because ""what"" is a rational question. ""What is it about me that I know
that you would be there for me no matter what?"" And they won't know how to answer it. They'll start describing you. ""I don't know, you're funny, I trust you. You've always been there for me."" You play devil's advocate. ""Good. That's the definition of a friend. What specifically is it about me that I know you'd be there for me
no matter what?"" And they'll continue to do the same. They'll keep trying to describe you.
You keep playing devil's advocate. You get the idea. Eventually they'll give up
and they'll start describing themselves. And they'll say, and this is what my friend said to me
when I did it with them, ""I don't know, Simon.
I don't even have to talk to you. I could just sit in the same room as you
and I feel inspired."" And I got goosebumps,
I'm getting them right now. They will articulate the value
you have in their life and you will have some sort
of emotional response, goosebumps or you'll well up, because what they're telling you
is your Why, your Why is the thing
you give to the world. You can do this with multiple friends
and they will say almost exactly, if not the exact same thing,
because that is your Why. That is the thing you give to the world. So it may not give you exact language, but it will put you squarely
in the ballpark for what your Why is. 12:54CA: Here's an anonymous question. ""I have a friend who is currently
struggling with depression, and he's just not like he used to be. I don't know what to say to him. He's actually annoyed by the question,
'How are you doing?' How can I offer my help?"" 13:09SS: So one of the things I learned
by accident a couple of years ago is sometimes statements
work better than questions. Because questions people can avoid, right? This is what we all did during COVID. ""How are you?"" ""Fine. Fine.""
Everyone's fine, right? And then what do you do with that? And so try making a statement, right? Something's wrong. Something's different. You're not the same. I'm worried about you. Make statements. And it leaves very little room for somebody to divert the conversation. You're not the person I know. And do it with love and empathy
and the most important thing, don't show up to solve the problem. Especially when you're starting
to have a difficult conversation, you don't show up to solve the problem. You show up to create an environment in which they'd be willing
to open up to you. That's the only goal. So try a statement instead of a question. 14:15CA: So here's the last question,
I'm going to ask this for me. What do you mean, Simon,
when you say that everyone is a leader? 14:25SS: Leadership has nothing
to do with rank or title. I know many people who sit
at the highest levels of organizations who are not leaders. We do as they tell us
because they have authority over us, but we don't trust them
and we wouldn't follow them. And yet I also know many people who sit
at very low levels of organizations that have no formal rank
and no formal authority, and yet they've made the choice to look after the person
to the left of them and the person to the right of them, and we would trust them
and follow them anywhere. Leadership is the responsibility
to see those around us rise. It's the responsibility to take care
of those around us. That's what leadership is. It's not about being in charge. It's about taking care
of those in our charge. And the only thing title
and authority allow you to do is lead with greater scale. Every single one of us has the opportunity
to be the leader we wish we had. Every single one of us. 15:13CA: Simon, thank you so much
for spending this time with us. 15:16SS: Thanks, Chris. I really appreciate it. Take care of yourself.
Take care of each other. 15:20[Get access to thought-provoking

2,This could be why you're depressed or anxious,Johann Hari,Sep 2019,"In a moving talk, journalist Johann Hari shares fresh insights on the causes of depression and anxiety from experts around the world -- as well as some exciting emerging solutions. ""If you're depressed or anxious, you're not weak and you're not crazy -- you're a human being with unmet needs,"" Hari says.", (484K),"Transcript (29 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیमराठीहिन्दीગુજરાતી中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01footnotefootnoteFor a really long time, I had two mysteries
that were hanging over me. I didn't understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid
to look into them. The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime,
year after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. And I wanted to understand why. Why is this happening to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder
to get through the day? And I wanted to understand this
because of a more personal mystery. 00:43When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling,
like pain was leaking out of me. I couldn't control it, I didn't understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know
why people get like this. Some people just naturally get
a chemical imbalance in their heads -- you're clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical
balance back to normal."" 01:16footnotefootnoteSo I started taking a drug
called Paxil or Seroxat, it's the same thing with different names
in different countries. And I felt much better,
I got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking
the maximum possible dose that you're legally allowed to take. And for a lot of those 13 years,
and pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. And I started asking myself,
""What's going on here? Because you're doing everything you're told to do by the story
that's dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?"" 01:50So to get to the bottom
of these two mysteries, for a book that I've written I ended up going on a big journey
all over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leading
experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through
depression and anxiety and out the other side
in all sorts of ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people
I got to know along the way. 02:14footnotefootnoteBut I think at the heart
of what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes
of depression and anxiety. Two of them are indeed in our biology. Your genes can make you
more sensitive to these problems, though they don't write your destiny. And there are real brain changes
that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most of the factors
that have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. They are factors in the way we live. And once you understand them, it opens up a very different
set of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option
of chemical antidepressants. 02:55For example, if you're lonely, you're more likely
to become depressed. If, when you go to work,
you don't have any control over your job, you've just got to do what you're told, you're more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get out
into the natural world, you're more likely to become depressed. 03:11And one thing unites a lot of the causes
of depression and anxiety that I learned about. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Everyone here knows you've all got natural
physical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those things away from you, you'd all be in real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human being
has natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life
has meaning and purpose. You need to feel that people
see you and value you. You need to feel you've got
a future that makes sense. And this culture we built
is good at lots of things. And many things are better
than in the past -- I'm glad to be alive today. But we've been getting less and less good at meeting these deep,
underlying psychological needs. And it's not the only thing
that's going on, but I think it's the key reason
why this crisis keeps rising and rising. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression
as just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we're living. 04:22footnotefootnoteAnd it only really began
to fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview
a South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He's a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield
happened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced
chemical antidepressants for people in that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,
had never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained. And they said to him, ""We don't need them,
we've already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were going to talk about
some kind of herbal remedy, like St. John's Wort, ginkgo biloba,
something like that. Instead, they told him a story. 05:02There was a farmer in their community
who worked in the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war
with the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back
to work in the rice fields. But apparently, it's super painful
to work under water when you've got an artificial limb, and I'm guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field
where he got blown up. The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms
of classic depression. The Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave him
an antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,
""What was it?"" They explained that they went
and sat with him. They listened to him. They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it
in the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly
understandable causes in his life. One of the doctors, talking to the people
in the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn't be in this position
that was screwing him up so much, he wouldn't have to go
and work in the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks,
his crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. They said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,
that was an antidepressant, that's what you mean, right?"" 06:18(Laughter) 06:19(Applause) 06:22footnotefootnoteIf you'd been raised to think
about depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor
for an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian
doctors knew intuitively, based on this individual,
unscientific anecdote, is what the leading
medical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. 06:48If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak, you're not crazy, you're not, in the main,
a machine with broken parts. You're a human being with unmet needs. And it's just as important to think here
about what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization
are not saying. They did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you need
to pull yourself together. It's your job to figure out
and fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""We're here as a group
to pull together with you, so together, we can figure out
and fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs, and it's what every
depressed person deserves. 07:35footnotefootnoteThis is why one of the leading
doctors at the United Nations, in their official statement
for World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less
about chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances
in the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem
goes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. 08:00But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, ""OK, I could see
all the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts
who were explaining this,"" but I kept thinking, ""How can we
possibly do that?"" The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex
than what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even begin with that insight? 08:22But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people
who were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meeting people
who were understanding the deeper causes
of depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. Obviously, I can't tell you
about all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression
and anxiety that I learned about, because they won't let me give
a 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them. 08:52footnotefootnoteBut I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions
that emerge from them, if that's alright. Here's the first. We are the loneliest society
in human history. There was a recent study
that asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you're no longer
close to anyone?"" And 39 percent of people
said that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the international
measurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europe
are just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. 09:21(Laughter) 09:22footnotefootnoteI spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert
in the world on loneliness, an incredible man
named professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one question
his work poses to us. Professor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors
on the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. They weren't bigger than the animals
they took down a lot of the time, they weren't faster than the animals
they took down a lot of the time, but they were much better
at banding together into groups and cooperating. This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. And it is making us feel awful. But it doesn't have to be this way. 10:17One of the heroes in my book,
and in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. He's a general practitioner
in a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible
depression and anxiety. And like me, he's not opposed
to chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give
some relief to some people. But he could see two things. Firstly, his patients were depressed
and anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable
reasons, like loneliness. And secondly, although the drugs
were giving some relief to some people, for many people,
they didn't solve the problem. The underlying problem. One day, Sam decided
to pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,
his medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away in her home
with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam's center,
she was told, ""Don't worry, we'll carry on giving you these drugs, but we're also going to prescribe
something else. We're going to prescribe for you
to come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other
depressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out something
meaningful you can all do together so you won't be lonely and you won't feel
like life is pointless."" 11:32The first time this group met, Lisa literally started
vomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her. But people rubbed her back,
the group started talking, they were like, ""What could we do?"" These are inner-city,
East London people like me, they didn't know anything about gardening. They were like, ""Why don't we
learn gardening?"" There was an area
behind the doctors' offices that was just scrubland. ""Why don't we make this into a garden?"" They started to take books
out of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. They started to get
their fingers in the soil. They started to learn
the rhythms of the seasons. There's a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do something
even more important. They started to form a tribe. They started to form a group. They started to care about each other. If one of them didn't show up, the others would go
looking for them -- ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure out
what was troubling them that day. The way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" 12:32footnotefootnoteThis approach is called
social prescribing, it's spreading all over Europe. And there's a small,
but growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real
and meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. 12:43And one day, I remember
standing in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed
friends had built -- it's a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it's very much inspired by a guy
called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. I was thinking, so often
when people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I'm sure
everyone here said it, I have -- we say, ""You just need
to be you, be yourself."" And I've realized, actually,
what we should say to people is, ""Don't be you. Don't be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part of a group."" 13:18(Applause) 13:21The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing
more and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that's partly what got us in this crisis. It lies on reconnecting
with something bigger than you. 13:33And that really connects
to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety
that I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets
and made us physically sick. I don't say that
with any sense of superiority, I literally came to give
this talk from McDonald's. I saw all of you eating that
healthy TED breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken over
our diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values
have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years,
philosophers have said, if you think life is about money,
and status and showing off, you're going to feel like crap. That's not an exact quote
from Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. 14:17footnotefootnoteBut weirdly, hardy anyone
had scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person
I got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who's at Knox College in Illinois, and he's been researching this
for about 30 years now. And his research suggests
several really important things. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display
your way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become
depressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become
much more driven by these beliefs. All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising
and Instagram and everything like them. 14:56And as I thought about this, I realized it's like we've all been fed
since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. We've been trained to look for happiness
in all the wrong places, and just like junk food
doesn't meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don't meet
your psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent time
with professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. Because on the one hand,
I found this really challenging. I could see how often
in my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of
show-offy, grand external solution. And I could see why that
did not work well for me. I also thought,
isn't this kind of obvious? Isn't this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie
on your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought
and all the retweets you got, you're going to think about moments of love, meaning
and connection in your life. I think that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talking
to professor Kasser and saying, ""Why am I feeling
this strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,
we all know these things. But in this culture,
we don't live by them."" We know them so well
they've become clichés, but we don't live by them. I kept asking why, why would we know
something so profound, but not live by it? And after a while,
professor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect
what is important about life."" I had to really think about that. ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us
to neglect what is important about life."" 16:34footnotefootnoteAnd professor Kasser wanted to figure out
if we can disrupt that machine. He's done loads of research into this; I'll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here
to try this with their friends and family. With a guy called Nathan Dungan,
he got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions
over a period of time, to meet up. And part of the point of the group was to get people to think
about a moment in their life they had actually found
meaning and purpose. For different people,
it was different things. For some people, it was playing music,
writing, helping someone -- I'm sure everyone here
can picture something, right? And part of the point of the group
was to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicate
more of your life to pursuing these moments
of meaning and purpose, and less to, I don't know,
buying crap you don't need, putting it on social media
and trying to get people to go, 'OMG, so jealous!'"" 17:24footnotefootnoteAnd what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous
for consumerism, right? Getting people to have these meetings,
articulate these values, determine to act on them
and check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people's values. It took them away from this hurricane
of depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness
in the wrong places, and towards more meaningful
and nourishing values that lift us out of depression. 17:53But with all the solutions that I saw
and have written about, and many I can't talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so long
to see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more
complicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people,
it's not like rocket science, right? At some level, we already
know these things. Why do we find it so hard to understand? I think there's many reasons. But I think one reason is
that we have to change our understanding of what depression
and anxiety actually are. There are very real
biological contributions to depression and anxiety. But if we allow the biology
to become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture
has done pretty much most of my life, what we're implicitly saying to people
is, and this isn't anyone's intention, but what we're implicitly
saying to people is, ""Your pain doesn't mean anything. It's just a malfunction. It's like a glitch in a computer program, it's just a wiring problem in your head."" But I was only able to start
changing my life when I realized your depression
is not a malfunction. It's a signal. Your depression is a signal. It's telling you something. 19:12(Applause) 19:17We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see
in the throes of depression -- I understand that really well
from personal experience. But with the right help,
we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they're a sign of weakness,
or madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. We need to start
listening to these signals, because they're telling us
something we really need to hear. It's only when we truly
listen to these signals, and we honor these signals
and respect these signals, that we're going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,
deeper solutions. The cows that are waiting all around us. 20:11Thank you. 20:12(Applause)"

when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. 00:46This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? 01:16Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. 02:09Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. 02:45However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? 03:29According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. 03:47But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse?"

was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. 01:17The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. 02:05Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. 02:41Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. 03:03Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. 03:38The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. 04:36Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. 04:59Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity."
2,Why art is a tool for hope,JR,Jun 2022,"Famed for enormous black-and-white portraits that are pasted on surfaces ranging from the Louvre to the US-Mexico border wall, multimedia artist JR continues to tackle ambitious projects. In this powerfully moving talk, he shares how he made a giant mural on the courtyard floor of a maximum-security prison -- with the help of guards and prisoners alike -- and ended up with much more than a compelling image.", (11K),"Transcript (10 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeСрпски, Srpskiالعربية中文 (简体)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00Wow, wow, people. You know, actually, I love people
because my work is about people. It's actually about bringing
people together. I'm an artist. I mean, until I found a real job, but now it looks
like it's getting pretty serious. 00:16(Laughter) 00:18But, you know, I also love walls. And I know that walls
are supposed to divide us, but I think I've found a way to use walls to bring us together. And I've tried this in different places. This was in Israel,
Palestine, 15 years ago, where, with my friend Marco, I took photos of Israeli
and Palestinian doing the same job and then pasted them
on Israeli city and Palestinian city, and people couldn't even
recognize who is who. This was in the favelas of Brazil. Faces of women on the hills
of the community. 00:48(Applause) 00:50Often the first target of the violence
that is happening there. This is a local museum we have in Paris,
it's called the Louvre. I don’t know if you’ve heard about it,
but I thought I’d give it a shout out. And with 400 people and paper and glue, we wheat-pasted the entire plazas to make
the pyramid ten times bigger. This was at the border
between Mexico and US. Thank you. 01:15(Applause and cheers) 01:18Kikito, the little kid, is one year old, and he lives in the little house you see
on the top left of the image. I just wonder, at his age,
what is his perspective on the wall? 01:30You know, each time I do a project,
I wonder: Can art change the world? And I never really know
how a projects starts. Couple years ago, I was making breakfast and a friend of mine called me. 01:42Friend Saul, he says, ""JR, you love walls. Why don't you do a project in prison?"" 01:48I was like, you know, I was just,
""Dude, you know, I would do it, but it's too much paperwork
administrative, bureaucracy. Plus, I've been arrested 15 times,
they don't want me in there."" 01:58footnotefootnoteAnd he was like, ""I know, bro, but you love walls so much,
what you would do in there. If you could do it, what could you do?"" 02:05I was like, ""OK, you know what?"" I had an idea. If I wanted to finish my poached eggs and my, you know, French toast
before it gets cold, I had to get rid of him. So I told him, ""You know what,
I'll paste the entire prison."" 02:19He was like, ""Wow, that's amazing."" He hung up the phone, I thought I'd never hear
from him for two decades. 02:25He called his friend Scott,
who was like, ""What's up?"" 02:27Saul is like, “I spoke to JR,
he’s down to do a project in prison.” 02:30Scott's like, ""That's amazing,
let me call the governor."" Hung up the phone, called the governor. 02:35Governor was like, ""Who's this JR?"" 02:37""He does black and white, and, you know, he takes photos of people,
he records their story ..."" 02:43""I'm sorry, I've never heard of it."" 02:44""Yes, there's very large murals."" 02:46footnotefootnoteAnd the governor was like,
""Wait, wait, wait. Before I was the governor,
I was in a mural. There were 1,300 people, each one of them recorded
their story, and I was one of them. Is that the same artist?"" 02:59The guy said, ""Yes,
that's the same artist."" 03:02""Give him full clearance for every prison
in the state of California."" 03:05(Laughter and applause) 03:06Calls me back. Next thing you know, I’m on Google Earth, and there's 35 prisons. I'm looking at them and I'm like,
well, first of all, I'm a wallpaper man. I cannot paste if I don't have
my clear surface. So that doesn't work,
that doesn't work, that doesn't work. The yard is made of sand and grass. I cannot do it. I know nothing about prisons. So then I see this one and I'm like,
""Wait, can we zoom in this one?"" I'm like, ""Oh, actually, you know what? The yard here in the center
looks like it's concrete. I could work on that."" 03:35""Look, JR, that's a supermax
security prison."" It's called Tehachapi, it's actually in the top five
of the most violent prisons. 03:43I was like, ""That will do it."" 03:44The next day, we flew there. We arrived there, and of course, you know,
it's not that easy to get there. It's like fences, electric fences, walls. And you add more walls
and more people that check your IDs. I get all the way to the yard. And it looked like some army guy
with bulletproof jackets and heavily armed who say, ""Alright, this is going
to be very simple. There's some people
waiting for you in a gymnasium. We gathered some inmates. You cannot approach them,
you cannot touch them. You can sit at the chair
that we designed for you, and we're going to surround
the area of the gymnasium."" 04:15That sounds fun. I enter the room, and we do this thing in France,
I don't know if you have that, but you shake people's hand, you know? So I started shaking people's hands,
""Hello, how are you? My name is JR. What's your name?"" And go around the table, and then I sat. And I spoke with them. A lot of them have been there
since they were teenagers, some of them even from the age of 13. And I've never seen anything like it. And so I told them about my art
and about the idea. 04:43And they asked me a question, they said, ""But what is the purpose of your art?"" 04:48Well, you know, that's a good question. I don't know if I can answer before,
you know, trying a project. So I explained them an idea, and I said,
“Wait, before we start anything, I just want you to know, if there's anyone here in this room
that by being in this project, you might offend some
of your victims outside, I'm not your guy. I'm going to get
too much attention for you. If I were you, don't participate
in this project."" 05:14Six or seven guys stood up
and left the room. I was like, ""Alright."" So we kept on going
and I started photographing them. Very simple, it's just a small
part of the process. I'm not really a photographer. That’s just one part that I use,
and I get to meet them and talk with them. And each of them started
explaining me their story, where they grew up, where they come from, how many years, some of them
spent decades in this prison. 05:37And the thing is that,
I told them, I said, ""Look, this photo is nothing. I need you to go in the next room. I'm going to leave a mic there. And I want you to record
your story from the beginning. I want to understand, you have to talk like,
if you're throwing a bottle in the ocean, I want to understand where you come from. And then what brought you to make
that crime that led you to prison. And if you changed,
explain how you changed and why."" 06:04They all went, some stayed for 10 minutes, some stayed for 20, 30 minutes. Some of them were crying in that place. 06:11Then I went back to my studio
and that's what we do. We print strips of paper
like a giant puzzle, so we have to combine it together. It's all just paper and glue. And then we combine them by numbers, and then we went back there. And we started bringing
everybody in the yard. And we started pasting. Everyone from every gang,
every race, participated. 06:31Now, the thing is, we're still in a supermax security prison. So the guards were like, ""Look, we love you
with your paper and stuff, but we’re going to count
everything you brought in, and we’re going to make sure
you leave with everything out. So every hour we're going to stop
this whole project and make sure there's not
one scissors missing, one brush, one, you know,
bucket, anything."" 06:52So we went through the process, and I had planned two to three days
to paste the whole thing. Those guys were so motivated, that in literally two
or three hours we had done it. 07:03So I said, ""Wait, stop, guys, they're going to bring you
back to your cell, give me a second. I'm going to try to get
some guards to paste with us."" 07:10And they were like, look,
""We love utopianism and stuff, but that’s where it stops.” 07:14""No, just give me a second."" 07:15So I start going to the guards and I say,
""Hey, do you mind participating?"" Fifty ""no,"" one guy said ""yes."" I say, ""Cool, come with me. They're going to show you."" And then another guard and another guard. And that's where the real
walls were falling down, because there's no communication
between those guards and the inmates. 07:31(Applause) 07:35And you know what? From the floor, it was so big
we couldn't see it anyway. You had to send a drone. So remember, again,
you're in a supermax security prison. It's geofencing. 07:46(Laughter) 07:47So we send in the drone, those guys have never seen
a drone their whole life, they were more excited about the drone
than the whole project. And I was so scared because I was like,
""I hope we did the puzzle right. Because if not, it's going to look
a bit ugly from up there."" And that's what you see from up there. 08:03(Applause and cheers) 08:13Thank you. 08:14The whole yard, all their faces. And when you zoom in, actually,
you see the picnic table, you can still see, it looks like a hole,
but it's actually an illusion. And you see the guys walking on it. 08:25Now, the craziest part of all of it is because of that crazy
permit that I had, I literally walked in
without being searched. I had my phone on me. So I started filming in there
and posting it on social media. So this guy there was showing me
his tattoo on day one. And then the evening, he called
his family and they said, ""We saw you on JR's Instagram. It's incredible, we see
what you guys are doing."" 08:51He was so proud the next day he said, ""JR, do you mind me showing my diplomas?"" 08:55They started realizing the impact
of suddenly having a connection with the outside. 08:59Then this guy showed up. His name is Kevin. You know, when I saw him,
I was like, ""Whoa."" In my life, I'll never have a second
chance to ask a guy, hopefully, why he has a fucking swastika on his face. 09:13(Laughter) 09:15And so I ask him,
and he was like, ""Oh, this?"" Almost like he forgot about it. He was like, ""I did this as a gang thing
when I went in prison. But now, if I could, I would remove it."" 09:25I was like, ""OK, do you mind
if I take a photo and I share it?"" 09:28He's like, ""Yeah, sure."" 09:29I share that photo. Now, as you can imagine, on social media, a lot of people were as shocked
and offended as I was. But a lot of people were like,
“That’s strange, because that doesn't connect
with the beauty in his eyes and the humanity in him."" 09:43So I went back to him
and I said, ""Look, Kevin, there's this thing called social media. I know you've been here too long
and you don't know about this, but people are writing comments,
I'm going to read them to you. And I think some of them
you should answer. So we started talking,
and I did many and many videos and asking him again and again,
and he responded and he went deeper and deeper. And it started a chain
of people who were like, ""Let's get this tattoo out of his face."" 10:07So now before we revealed
the image that you saw, I didn't want to throw it
to the world like that. 10:14For now, only the inmates
and I have seen it. We started an app
where you can actually go in, it's totally free, and you can go and click
on any face and hear their story for as much as they want. 10:25(Applause) 10:31I wonder, you know, I've seen it. I saw people telling me that they
heard story, and like a podcast. But I wonder, how would
they feel about it? You know, I wanted the feedback from them. 10:42So I got a permit to go back into prison. And this time I said, let me work
on some more walls, I'll find an idea. So I go back in there
and I started working on the walls, but it was really, the excuse was like,
I need to speak to you guys. So I said, ""What happened, guys?"" 10:56They were like, ""Well, what do
you mean, what happened?"" 10:59I was like, ""I was on the outside,
I couldn't speak to you guys. What was the impact inside?"" 11:03""Oh, the impact inside is pretty simple. Let me tell you for myself, I mean,
my daughter never visited me in 14 years. And now she sat in her bedroom,
and she listened to my audio, and now she sees me every week.” He says, ""You can ask whoever
you want of those guys here, and they'll tell you the same story."" 11:20(Applause) 11:23And he told me another thing happened. ""Is that the guards
started listening to our stories. They treat us differently now."" 11:32Then we started seeing
the walls falling down. So I left a little souvenir
in the courtyard. I was like, ""Let me make one more
wall disappear before I go."" So we pasted the mountains
from behind the wall on the wall. And it's still there, actually. 11:46(Applause) 11:51This one is still in level four,
which is the supermax security prison. And they told me in winter
it becomes all snowy. And so you actually
don't tell the difference between the reality and the wall. 12:02Now, Kevin was still in prison, so I visited him again. And something had changed in him. He was already helping others, and, you know, you could tell that he
almost had forgotten about his tattoo, even if it was still there, because you cannot remove
tattoos in prison. So I bought him a book, and I told him, ""Look,
there's a swastika on the cover, I thought you would like it."" And he laughed. But I said, ""No, seriously,
this is our friend, Art Spiegelman, who wrote it, and he told the story
about his family in the Holocaust."" 12:33And so that night he went
and read the book. And he was really moved. He called his mom and he said, ""Mom, those French people brought me
this book that talks about the Holocaust."" 12:44And she said, ""But you stupid moron. Your family was from Poland. They were hiding Jews. They died in Auschwitz
because of protecting them. And you go in prison
and do this on your face?"" He was in shock. 12:58Couple years later,
which is a couple months ago, he came out. Like many others from the project, almost all of them got moved
to a lower-security prison, and one third of them got freed
because of having good grades and notes by the guards
after the project. So Kevin went out,
and the first thing he did was to go up that hill
that he looked at for 17 years, to look down at the prison
that he was staying in. And then the second thing,
as I promised him, I took him to a doctor
to remove his tattoo. And the session started with the laser,
and it's very painful. And at the end of it, the doctor removed
the laser and she told him, ""Well, who's better than a Jewish doctor
to remove your swastika?"" 13:46(Laughter and applause) 13:53And that's him now. 13:54(Applause and cheers) 14:01You know, we really tried
to bring him here. But his parole officer,
who is actually really nice, he said ""JR, you're pushing too much. He's not going to Canada. Sorry about this.” But he knows I'm here talking about it. 14:14You know, I want to use art as a bridge to make people talk to each other. I'm not an activist, I'm just an artist. I don't try to tell people what to think. I just try to make them think. And I really see art, to me, it's like, it's in the process. That's what's important. And after this whole project,
after everything I showed you, what shook them,
what struck them the most, is that I shook their hand. So at the end, they even
asked me for a hug. 14:43Now I remember
their first question, which was: What is the purpose of your art? Well, art can change things,
but can it change the world? Or can it change a man? Before you answer that question, think, at some point in your life,
have you changed? And if yes, if you did, why can't they? 15:06Thank you. 15:09(Applause and cheers) 15:22Helen Walters: That's amazing,
you're amazing. You also just got back from Ukraine, and I wanted to show us
just another piece of your work. 15:33JR: Oh yeah, that was in Ukraine. The biggest city in the west side
of Ukraine is called Lviv. And a friend of mine
took that photo at the border, he sent it to me,
I printed it 150 feet long. We rolled it as a tarp,
walked through the border with it. It's actually easy to go that way,
you know, to enter Ukraine. So they were like, ""Oh, you're
going to go this way? Sure."" And then we drove to, you know,
I met some people on Instagram, and they came
and picked me up in their car. And then we gathered hundreds of people. We wanted to show Putin's planes
who they were shooting out. 16:08(Applause) 16:11That little girl is actually safe. When she got photographed,
she was coming out of the country. So she’s now in Warsaw, and she’s OK. And since then, actually, we're moving this image all around Europe. So while TED was happening
in the last four days, the image was in Berlin,
Dusseldorf, Venice this morning. And then it will keep traveling
and each time, each place, people are gathering by themselves
and opening it up. 16:37HW: That is amazing, JR, thank you. 16:38JR: Thank you. (Applause)"

You saw the release of Serena in that great yellow
bathing suit last week and when I saw it,
all I could think of was, ""Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"" I was very selfish, I know. So I asked you about that picture, and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture. What do you mean? 00:30Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident. I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself, and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going -- 00:44GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe? 00:46SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it, and I didn't really tell a lot of people, to be quite honest, and I'd been saving it, and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and -- 00:57(Laughter) 00:58GK: And there it was. 00:59SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much -- and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls, and I'm like, that's weird, and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no. But it was a good moment. I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK. 01:14GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks, so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it. 01:20SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time. I've been just tracking it. 18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it, and I've been so good about it, and this was the one time that I slipped. 01:34GK: There you go. Well, congratulations. 01:36SW: Yes, thank you. 01:38GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news, were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried? That you were pregnant, I mean. 01:44SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open, which is one of the biggest grand slams. 01:51GK: You found out two days before? 01:52SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew. I was nervous. I wasn't quite sure what to think, but I just knew that at that moment it was really important for me
to just focus right there at the Australian Open, and I was definitely not sure what to do. I was like, can I play? I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so, so I had a lot of questions. 02:18GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won. 02:22(Cheers) 02:25SW: Yeah. May I just say, 23 grand slams to you. 02:32SW: Thank you. 02:33(Applause) 02:35GK: While pregnant! 02:36SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no. 02:39GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant? 02:42SW: I did. It wasn't very easy. You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant, they get sick and they get tired. 02:49GK: Have you had morning sickness? 02:51SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't. But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out, and I had to really take all that energy, put it in a paper bag, so to say, and throw it away, because I really felt
like I didn't have time to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything, because pregnant or not, no one knew, and I was supposed to win that tournament as I am every tournament that I show up. I am expected to win, and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news. 03:18GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story. 03:21SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point and kind of just bottle them up and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was. 03:32GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love. Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport. I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, ""Guess where I'm going?"" They said, ""Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant."" But then you always have
these cranky Yankees. On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase, who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things. You have responded to him. I'm not even going
to dignify what he said, but you responded. Why did you respond? 03:57SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments, and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers and the people that I've worked with. I've been a pro for almost 20 years, and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up, and it's something that these young women, they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me, and for me, it's just like, I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them. So not only -- 04:20(Applause) 04:21Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers, I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other and to stand up for myself. And at that point it was
really important for me to say, like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere, but this is inappropriate, and there's time and there's
a place for everything. And that really
wasn't the time and the place. 04:43GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere, because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36. And your coach said
age is always important, but in tennis it's very important, but he has no doubt
that you're coming back. Have you thought, am I coming back? Will I take some time off? I know the women on the tour are saying, ""How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"" What are you thinking? 05:04SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know, so for me everything is really mental. I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet. I'm really inspired by my sister. She's a year older than me,
and that's something that -- if she's still playing, I know I can play. 05:18(Laughter) 05:20And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too. So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently, and I know that
it's something I want to do. And my story is definitely not over yet. I was talking to my coach about it, and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life, and my baby's going to be in the stands and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much. 05:47GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one, to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here. A lot of people feel that. I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena. You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time: pregnant, huge win, fell in love. And when I saw you last year, I was saying, ""How's
your love life? Da da da."" You said, ""I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy. You won't know who he is."" I said, ""What's his name?"" 06:17SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes. 06:19GK: And you said, ""Alexis Ohanian.""
I said, ""I know him!"" He's awesome. But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek, and you said, you neither. 06:27SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either, but it's been the best thing for me. 06:31GK: The best thing why? Does that look like a nerdy geek? Look at the shirt. 06:36(Laughter) 06:37No, he's a very nice guy. 06:38SW: You can tell he's into technology. 06:40GK: He's a very, very nice guy. I like him very much. So how did he succeed
when others have failed? How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me? 06:49SW: Well, I'm not going to say that, but ... 06:53(Laughter) 06:54GK: Say it, Serena, say it! 06:56SW: Well ... 06:57(Laughter) 07:00Yes. 07:02(Applause) 07:05GK: But you know what I mean. 07:06SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate, and when she said that to me, I was like, you know, he really is, and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life. 07:17GK: Like? 07:18SW: Something simple. My fashion company,
we have a show every year, so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy, because I do everything for the show, and everything for it, so I was running around like crazy, and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had, and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one, and it was -- it's a weird story. It was better in person, I promise. 07:42GK: Was it a wonderful proposal? Or was it a Beyoncé song? ""If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it""? Were you feeling pressure to get married? Did you know it was coming? 07:52SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person. I really love my life. I love my freedom. I heard that kind of changes. But I love everything that I do, and I love my career, and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that. I've actually been so career-oriented and in fact, when he proposed, I was almost angry. Not almost. I was angry, because it was right
in the middle of my training season, and I said, ""I gotta win
the Australian Open. I can't fly to Rome."" Because he wanted to take me to Rome, and I said, ""I can't. I gotta win."" But that's how focused I was. 08:30GK: This is a girl that says,
""No, I can't go to Rome."" OK. 08:33SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass. I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record, and that really meant a lot to me, and when I put my mind to something, I really am determined to reach it no matter what. 08:48GK: You know, you said that for you -- I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you. 08:53SW: It is. 08:54GK: What do you mean? 08:55SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive. I feel like once you experience it, you always want to get that feeling again, and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old, but I never forgot that feeling, and I feel like every time I win one, I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship. There's really no feeling
in the world like that. And it's like, all these years of training and being a little kid and playing, and then winning
is a wonderful experience. So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling, and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like -- 09:32GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser. 09:35SW: I'm not the best loser. 09:37GK: That you're very, very, very bad. Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose. I get that. But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it. 09:46(Laughter) 09:48SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say. 09:51(Laughter) 09:53(Applause) 09:55GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus, because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story knows that you two are very close, and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do, but I often wonder,
when you're playing her, do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her. Is it harder for you
playing her or easier? 10:17SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself, because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together. And it was something
that has been difficult, because she's my toughest opponent. She's tall, she's fast, she hits hard like me, she serves like me. It's really like playing a wall. 10:33GK: She knows you. 10:34SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it, so it's something that is not very easy, but it's really about,
when I go out there, I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself, ""You know what? I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better. I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend, today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment anywhere on this world."" 11:02GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus? Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena. 11:10SW: Yes. 11:12GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister. Do you feel guilt about that? Do you feel joy in that? Is that a difficult position for you? 11:19SW: I don't feel anything in there. In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena. She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend, she's my soul mate. I mean -- There's pictures of her pushing me, really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them, of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court, and she always took care of me. I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff, and she would take her money
and give it to me at school and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without, and that's the kind of person
she actually is since I've always known her. So we always have this incredible
respect for each other and this incredible love, and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful but you can still have
a wonderful relationship. On the court we are mortal enemies, but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again. And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me, but for Venus -- 12:17(Laughter) 12:20GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball and say, ""That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah""? You never have any moment like that? 12:28SW: I feel like she should have
those moments, because she's never done
anything bad to me, but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister. 12:35GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really? I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad. 12:41SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them. 12:44GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that. 12:47SW: Yes. GK: I know that. 12:48SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose, and we are incredibly close. Not only her. I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close. 12:59GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together and say, look, we're going
to go out there and -- there's nothing? 13:05SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open, we were in the locker room together, and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing. I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate, but she was so mad at me. She's like, ""Serena, stop!""
And I was just laughing at her. But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said, the second we step on the court, it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies, but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just -- It is what it is,
because at the end of the day, she'll always be my sister. I'm not going to play Australia in -- Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever, but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say? Let's be safe and say 50 years. 13:45GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you. When you think about it,
never been anybody who has intersected
gender and race the way you have, the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have. And when you were growing up,
did you say, ""I want to be like that""? Because now little girls
are looking at you saying, ""I want to be like that."" Who was the ""I want
to be like that"" for you? 14:05SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up. For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best, and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best. So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young, I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles, and I would even see Pete Sampras, and I would see what they did, and I noticed that Steffi and Monica didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players, and they kind of were on their own, and they were just so focused and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did, and I was like, ""I want to do that."" So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best, and if you want to be the best, you have to hang around people and you have to look at people
that are the best, because you're not going to be the best if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level. 14:50GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you. 14:52SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard. 14:54SW: People say, ""Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic."" Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age. I grew up when I got older, and I had to work really hard, and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard is because I was
really, really, really small. 15:08GK: Yeah. You are no longer small. 15:11SW: No, I'm fully grown now. But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason. I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties. 15:20GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body. Your body brings men
and women to their knees. And I mean in a good way. A lot has been made about your body. It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious, there's never been anything like it. Did you have body issues
when you were growing up? Have you always been
comfortable with your body? 15:43SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female growing up in the public eye, it is a lot of scrutiny that you face, and as any female that's a teenager, I definitely was not
comfortable in my body. I didn't like it. I didn't understand why I had muscles. And I stopped lifting weights. I was like, I'm not going to do this. But then after I won the US Open, I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach, and I wanted to be happy with it, and I was so appreciative of it. I'm always healthy. I'm really fortunate and superblessed, and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body, but I want other people
and other young girls that have experienced
what I've experienced to be happy with themselves. So whatever people say -- masculine, whatever,
too much, too little -- I'm OK with it as long as I love myself. 16:30(Applause) 16:34GK: I know you learn a lot from winning, but what have you learned from losing? 16:39SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today. The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses, and some of them are extremely painful, but I wouldn't take any of them away, because every time I lose, it takes a really long time
for me to lose again because I learn so much from it. And I encourage everyone that I talk to -- I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens -- not in sports --
in business or in school -- learn from it. Don't live in the past,
live in the present, and don't make the same
mistakes in the future. That's something
that I always try to live by. 17:14GK: Now you're planning a wedding and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida? What are you thinking? Big or small? 17:25SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big, but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person. So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking -- My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today. I'm not too serious. 17:38GK: And you like to dance. And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what? 17:43SW: Oh, next for me. Obviously I'm going to have a baby and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis and keep working on my fashion line. That'll be really fun. 17:53GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl? 17:55SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other. It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling. 18:01GK: Gayle is a unisex name. Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on! 18:05SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome. We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much. 18:10Thank you guys. 18:11(Applause)"
2,How to stop swiping and find your person on dating apps,Christina Wallace,Jul 2018,"Let's face it, online dating can suck. So many potential people, so much time wasted -- is it even worth it? Podcaster and entrepreneur Christina Wallace thinks so, if you do it right. In a funny, practical talk, Wallace shares how she used her MBA skill set to invent a ""zero date"" approach and get off swipe-based apps -- and how you can, too.", (77K),"Transcript (27 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I first tried online dating
my freshman year of college, which was in 2001,
in case you can't see my wrinkle. Now, as you may have noticed,
I'm six-feet tall, and when I arrived at my chosen university and realized our men's Division III
basketball team averaged five-foot-eight, I abandoned the on-campus
scene and went online. Now, back then, online dating
was pretty close to the plot of ""You've Got Mail."" You'd write long emails
back and forth for weeks, before you finally met up in real life. Except, in my case,
you'd realize you have no chemistry and so now, you're back to square one. 00:34So, while online dating
has changed a lot in the last 17 years, many of the frustrations remain the same. Because here's what it does well. It broadens your pool of potential dates beyond your existing social
and professional circles. And here's what it doesn't do well. Literally everything else. 00:54(Laughter) 00:56A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving
math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA. So, when things aren't working out,
I tend to take a step back, apply my business toolkit
to figure out why, and to fix it. My love life was no exception. 01:12The summer before I turned 30,
I took myself on a relationship off-site. Which means I went camping solo
in Maine for a week, to do a retro on my track record
of mediocre relationships. Because the thing was,
I knew what I wanted in a partner. Kindness, curiosity, empathy,
a sense of purpose. And yet, here's what I chose for online: Ivy League degree, six feet or taller, lives within 12 subway stops of me. It's not that I intentionally
prioritized those things, it's just the easiest to vet for online. It kind of is like a résumé review, which is why these guys
looked great on paper and never quite fit me. 01:51So when I went back online
in the spring of 2016, I decided to reengineer the process
through some classic business tools. First, I went to OkCupid, because I wanted to avoid
the gamification of swipe-based apps. And also, because I wanted
a writing sample. Next, I set up a sales funnel, throwing out any sense of my type, and instead defining the criteria
that would qualify a lead. An inbound message had to do three things: had to be written in complete sentences
and with good grammar; it had to reference
something in my profile, so I know it's not
a copy-and-paste situation; and it had to avoid all sexual content. I figured this was a pretty low bar, but it turns out,
of my 210 inbound messages, only 14 percent cleared that hurdle. 02:34(Laughter) 02:36Next, I wanted to meet in real life
as quickly as possible, because the things I cared about,
I couldn't see online. But the research, and my experience, shows you only need about 30 seconds
with someone to tell if you click. 02:48So I invented the zero date. The zero date is one drink, one hour. With the goal of answering one question: Would I like to have
dinner with this person? Not ""are they the one""? Literally, ""Would I like to spend
three hours across the table from this person?"" You tell them you have a hard stop -- drinks with girlfriends,
a conference call with China -- it doesn't matter, they don't know you. The point is one hour. If it's awesome,
you schedule a first date. And if it's not awesome,
you downshift into entertainer mode and you workshop a few new stories
for your next networking event. 03:23Plus, because it's just an hour,
you can squeeze up to three in one evening and then you only have to do your hair
and pick out one great outfit a week. 03:31The zero date also gave me a chance
to see how they responded to me asking them out. I figured not everyone
would dig my moxie, and I was right. Of my 29 qualified leads,
only 15 replied to my message, and of those, six scheduled a zero date. 03:46My first zero date
was with a set designer. And we were both into yoga and preferred our bagels
with peanut butter, so it looked pretty promising. But two minutes in, I could tell
it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be
spending dinner with him. After that, I was a little nervous
about going to my next zero date. But we had agreed to meet
on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade with a flask of whiskey
to watch the sunset, and honestly, it was two blocks
from my apartment. Plus, this guy had a podcast,
I have a podcast, worst case scenario,
we can talk about our podcasts. 04:15Then, Chas set down next to me. And this kind and empathetic man told great jokes
and asked even better questions. He was a lawyer and a writer,
and his eyes twinkled when he laughed and they squeezed tight when I kissed him and at some point in the evening,
our zero date became a first date. And two years later, we have a washer,
dryer and two house plants together. 04:38Now, I can't promise
you're going to end up with house plants. But the point of this story is that online dating
doesn't have to suck. Don't treat it like a game,
and don't treat it like a resume review. Instead, use it to source
and qualify leads and then get offline as quickly
as possible with the zero date. Because the point of this isn't swiping. It's finding your person. 05:01Good luck. 05:02(Applause)"
2,How couples can sustain a strong sexual connection for a lifetime,Emily Nagoski,Sep 2019,"As a sex educator, Emily Nagoski is often asked: How do couples sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term? In this funny, insightful talk, she shares her answer -- drawing on (somewhat surprising) research to reveal why some couples stop having sex while others keep up a connection for a lifetime.", (103K),"Transcript (23 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I'm sitting in a bar
with a couple of friends -- literally, a couple, married couple. They're the parents of two young children, seven academic degrees between them, big nerds, really nice people
but very sleep-deprived. And they ask me the question
I get asked more than any other question. They go, ""So, Emily, how do couples, you know,
sustain a strong sexual connection over multiple decades?"" 00:30I'm a sex educator, which is why
my friends ask me questions like this, and I am also a big nerd like my friends. I love science, which is why
I can give them something like an answer. Research actually has
pretty solid evidence that couples who sustain
strong sexual connections over multiple decades have two things in common. 00:49footnotefootnoteBefore I can tell my friends
what those two things are, I have to tell them a few things
that they are not. These are not couples
who have sex very often. Almost none of us have sex very often. We are busy. They are also not couples who necessarily
have wild, adventurous sex. One recent study actually found that the couples
who are most strongly predicted to have strong sexual
and relationship satisfaction, the best predictor of that is not what kind of sex they have or how often or where they have it but whether they cuddle after sex. And they are not necessarily couples who constantly can't wait
to keep their hands off each other. Some of them are. They experience what the researchers
call ""spontaneous desire,"" that just sort of seems
to appear out of the blue. Erika Moen, the cartoonist
who illustrated my book, draws spontaneous desire
as a lightning bolt to the genitals -- kaboom! -- you just want it
out of the blue. That is absolutely one normal,
healthy way to experience sexual desire. But there's another healthy way
to experience sexual desire. It's called ""responsive desire."" Where spontaneous desire seems
to emerge in anticipation of pleasure, responsive desire emerges
in response to pleasure. 02:06There's a sex therapist in New Jersey
named Christine Hyde, who taught me this great metaphor
she uses with her clients. She says, imagine that your best friend
invites you to a party. You say yes because
it's your best friend and a party. But then, as the date approaches,
you start thinking, ""Aw, there's going to be all this traffic. We have to find child care. Am I really going to want
to put my party clothes on and get there at the end of the week?"" But you put on your party clothes
and you show up to the party, and what happens? You have a good time at the party. If you are having fun at the party, you are doing it right. 02:42When it comes to a sexual connection,
it's the same thing. You put on your party clothes, you set up the child care, you put your body in the bed, you let your skin
touch your partner's skin and allow your body
to wake up and remember, ""Oh, right! I like this. I like this person!"" That's responsive desire, and it is key to understanding the couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term, because -- and this is the part
where I tell my friends the two characteristics of the couples who
do sustain a strong sexual connection -- one, they have a strong friendship
at the foundation of their relationship. Specifically, they have strong trust. Relationship researcher and therapist, developer of emotionally focused therapy, Sue Johnson, boils trust down to this question: Are you there for me? Especially, are you emotionally
present and available for me? Friends are there for each other. One. 03:40The second characteristic
is that they prioritize sex. They decide that it matters
for their relationship. They choose to set aside all the other
things that they could be doing -- the children they could be raising
and the jobs they could be going to, the other family members
to pay attention to, the other friends they might
want to hang out with. God forbid they just want
to watch some television or go to sleep. Stop doing all that stuff
and create a protected space where all you're going to do
is put your body in the bed and let your skin
touch your partner's skin. So that's it: best friends, prioritize sex. 04:21So I said this to my friends in the bar. I was like, best friends, prioritize sex,
I told them about the party, I said you put your skin
next to your partner's skin. And one of the partners
I was talking to goes, ""Aaagh."" 04:34(Laughter) 04:35And I was like, ""OK,
so, there's your problem."" 04:37(Laughter) 04:38The difficulty was not that they did not
want to go to the party, necessarily. If the difficulty is just a lack
of spontaneous desire for party, you know what to do: you put on your party clothes
and show up for the party. If you're having fun at the party,
you're doing it right. Their difficulty was that this was a party where she didn't love
what there was available to eat, the music was not her favorite music, and she wasn't totally sure she felt great
about her relationships with people who were at the party. And this happens all the time: nice people who love each other
come to dread sex. These couples, if they seek sex therapy, the therapist might have them stand up and put as much distance
between their bodies as they need in order to feel comfortable, and the less interested partner
will make 20 feet of space. 05:27And the really difficult part
is that space is not empty. It is crowded with weeks or months or more of the, ""You're not listening to me,"" and ""I don't know what's wrong with me
but your criticism isn't helping,"" and, ""If you loved me, you would,""
and, ""You're not there for me."" Years, maybe, of all
these difficult feelings. In the book, I use
this really silly metaphor of difficult feelings as sleepy hedgehogs that you are fostering until
you can find a way to set them free by turning toward them
with kindness and compassion. And the couples who struggle
to maintain a strong sexual connection, the distance between them
is crowded with these sleepy hedgehogs. 06:09And it happens in any relationship
that lasts long enough. You, too, are fostering
a prickle of sleepy hedgehogs between you and your certain
special someone. The difference between couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection and the ones who don't is not that they don't experience
these difficult hurt feelings, it's that they turn towards
those difficult feelings with kindness and compassion so that they can set them free and find their way back to each other. So my friends in the bar are faced
with the question under the question, not, ""How do we sustain
a strong connection?"" but, ""How do we find our way back to it?"" And, yes, there is science
to answer this question, but in 25 years as a sex educator, one thing I have learned
is sometimes, Emily, less science, more hedgehogs. So I told them about me. 07:00I spent many months writing a book about
the science of women's sexual well-being. I was thinking about sex
all day, every day, and I was so stressed by the project
that I had zero -- zero! -- interest in actually having any sex. And then I spent months
traveling all over, talking with anyone who would listen about the science
of women's sexual well-being. And by the time I got home, you know, I'd show up for the party,
put my body in the bed, let my skin touch my partner's skin, and I was so exhausted and overwhelmed
I would just cry and fall asleep. And the months of isolation
fostered fear and loneliness and frustration. So many hedgehogs. My best friend, this person
I love and admire, felt a million miles away. 07:53But ... he was still there for me. No matter how many
difficult feelings there were, he turned toward them
with kindness and compassion. He never turned away. And what was the second characteristic of couples who sustain
a strong sexual connection? They prioritize sex. They decide that it matters
for their relationship, that they do what it takes
to find their way back to the connection. I told my friends what sex therapist
and researcher Peggy Kleinplatz says. She asks: What kind of sex
is worth wanting? My partner and I looked
at the quality of our connection and what it brought to our lives, and we looked at the family
of sleepy hedgehogs I had introduced into our home. And we decided it was worth it. We decided -- we chose -- to do
what it took to find our way, turning towards each
of those sleepy hedgehogs, those difficult hurt feelings, with kindness and compassion and setting them free
so that we could find our way back to the connection that mattered
for our relationship. 09:01This is not the story we are usually told about how sexual desire works
in long-term relationships. But I can think of nothing more romantic, nothing sexier, than being chosen as a priority because that connection matters enough, even after I introduced all of these
difficult feelings into our relationship. 09:26How do you sustain a strong
sexual connection over the long term? You look into the eyes
of your best friend, and you keep choosing
to find your way back. 09:39Thank you. 09:41(Applause)"

this big red button, what would you do? For many people, there’s no greater
motivation to do something than being told they can’t. So, what is it about being told “no”
that triggers this response? 00:29One of the most enduring explanations
for this behavior is what psychologists
call reactance theory. Reactance is a motivational state 
that occurs when people feel their freedom 
is being threatened, and it compels them to take actions 
they see as restoring that freedom. Sometimes this emerges as 
general frustration or direct argument, but the most straightforward response is to simply do the thing 
they were told not to. This behavior plays out in public spaces, like when people ignore health campaigns
they perceive as overbearing, and in private spaces,
like parent-child relationships. However, there are situations 
where something being forbidden actually makes it less tempting. 01:17In 1972, psychologists 
at the University of Colorado wanted to know if a romantic relationship 
facing parental disapproval was more likely to strengthen 
or crumble under the pressure. To answer this question, 
they surveyed 140 couples, varying widely in measures of happiness, but all fairly serious 
in terms of commitment. Only some couples reported perceived
parental opposition to their relationship over the study’s six-month period. But those that did also reported 
a steady increase in love for one another. 01:55The researchers named this trend
the Romeo and Juliet Effect after literature’s most famous
forbidden lovers and concluded that the results were
largely motivated by reactance. But in the decades since this publication, most follow-up studies have suggested
the opposite is true. In fact, the long-term success 
of a romantic relationship can be predicted by the perceived
approval or disapproval of the couple’s friends and family. This trend is known 
as the Social Network Effect. 02:31So why doesn’t reactance win 
out over the Social Network Effect? You might think it’s because we value 
our existing relationships over our potential relationships. But in most cases, 
disapproving friends and family are just voicing negative opinions or 
passively not supporting a relationship. It’s rarely a dramatic choice 
of us or them. And when it comes to parents, most people with good relationships 
with their parents feel they can ignore their parent’s advice
without serious consequences, while people with bad parental 
relationships often don’t care what they think anyway. 03:09So if disapproved relationships are 
more likely to fail, does this mean we’re not willing
to fight to date who we want? Well, it might vary from person to person. One theory is that there’s actually 
two types of reactance: defiant reactance, which is impulsively 
doing the opposite of what we’re told, and independent reactance, which reflects
our deeper desire to make our own choices. For example, if you tell someone with high
defiant reactance to lower their voice, they’ll probably start shouting. Whereas someone with high independent
reactance is more likely to simply ignore the request 
and do what they believe is appropriate. So when it comes 
to relationship disapproval, a defiant person might respond by pursuing
their romance in secret, but that doesn’t change 
how the group’s opinion negatively impacts their relationship. Conversely, someone with a particularly
independent personality might be capable of ignoring their friends’ concerns
and loving whomever they want. 04:18The idea of defiant and independent
reactance is fairly new, and researchers are still working 
to uncover all the motivations behind the Social Network Effect. But these theories help illuminate 
the important relationship between reactance and our competing needs
for independence and inclusion. How we balance these desires varies
across individuals and cultures. But no matter how prone 
to reactance we may be, our social networks are vital 
to our sense of identity and well-being. This is especially true 
in our romantic relationships. Studies have found that support 
from a few close companions can help buffer against disapproval 
from others. And most relationships do better 
once the individuals involved find supportive social networks. This outcome might not seem as romantic
as a forbidden love affair, but it’s actually in keeping 
with the story of Romeo and Juliet, whose embattled relationship couldn't
endure the threats of extreme disapproval."
2,"The profound power of gratitude and ""living eulogies""",Andrea Driessen,Jul 2022,"Why do we often wait so long to recognize each other's gifts? Why are the truest compliments for the people we love often said only after they're no longer around to hear and savor them? Andrea Driessen makes the case for writing eulogies for the living, sharing the power of ""Gracenotes"" to offer connection on a deeper level and dispel any regrets of waiting until a loved one's death to appreciate their presence in your life.", (44K),"Transcript (10 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de Portugalالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00I have a death wish. 00:04Now before you just boo me off the stage
for saying such a thing in a pandemic, I'll explain with a little back story, starting with my second grade gym class. This was the longest, most humiliating hour of the week. My PE teacher, Mr. Jensen,
was a former drill sergeant, and I always felt like the weakest kid. On my report card, he checked the boxes corresponding
to what must have been important for kids' physical
development in the '70s. Oh, except the one
on leadership qualities, he left that one unchecked. Then he added a note. He said, ""Andrea
has difficulty kicking balls."" 00:47(Laughter) 00:51My dad, who was always the one to see
people's gifts instead of their limits, wrote a letter back to Mr. Jensen. He said, ""Andrea may have
difficulty kicking balls, but you should see her stand
on her head and do cartwheels."" 01:04(Laughter) 01:06As a kid, I was usually
the smallest on the playground, never athletic, picked last for, you guessed it, kickball. I took solace in my dad's sincere support. But now, as a business owner, I can see that ball kicking
can really come in handy 01:25(Laughter) 01:27Anyway, in that one simple sentence
to a short-sighted gym teacher ""but you should see her,"" my dad showed me that focusing
on strengths more than weaknesses feels really good. That there are other ways
to look at the world and that it's important
to recognize each other's gifts. 01:46So with all that great karma my dad had built up
around appreciation with me, it only seems right that some praise
would ultimately come his way. Long into his fruitful
and active retirement, he was featured in a hometown
newspaper story. The article described the many ways he contributed to our small
Midwestern town. And he sent a copy of that piece
to my siblings and me with a short handwritten note. He was always really modest, so he just said, ""Well, it's better than having
a eulogy read over a casket."" 02:22My dad died seven years
ago at the age of 96, and he was surrounded by family
and friends and two hospice workers. He left this world not 20 feet
from where he’d come into it. He was born and he died
in the same house. I like to think he died
as well as he'd lived. On his own terms. 02:47I had the honor of giving the eulogy, and ultimately he'd chosen
cremation over that ""casket."" As I looked over at my dad's ashes, I had to smile because, you know,
our dad really loved beer. So instead of putting
his ashes in a blasé urn, we put them in a big, shiny beer growler. 03:09(Laughter) So my remarks over the growler
were a sincere tribute to a superb human being. Not unusual as far as eulogies go, except for one thing. He'd already heard it. Those many years earlier,
after I'd received his note about how having nice things
said about you while you're alive beats the alternative, I wrote my dad a letter. And the theme of the letter
reflected a common thread that I had noticed in his long life. The theme of building. Our dad had helped to build
so many things. Gun emplacements in World War II; a new industrial park; a vibrant hobby as a self-taught
and later acclaimed woodcarver; confidence in others; a many-decades-long marriage; a family, a home. And he had the chance to read it all
long before he died. 04:15So that had me asking, why are eulogies only for dead people? Why do we wait so long
to recognize each other's gifts? Why are the truest compliments
and the sincerest sentiments said about people we love when they can't hear and savor
and relish them? And how do we honor all those around us
who are very much alive? 04:45So what if we turn regret on its head and take all that love
and conscientiousness that we habitually
express after people die and do it while they're still here? Because doing that eases the pain
of death and regret for both the dying and the living. So I set out on an intentional quest
to bear witness to people who are dying. As a hospice volunteer, I'm learning that those who are dying, they want to know that they're loved. That they've loved well. They feel regret for all sorts of things. For things they didn't do
and words they didn't say. Deep down, they want to know
that their lives have mattered. They feel really mortal. Because they are. As am I. As are you. 05:45So when we learn a loved one may be dying, we face a pivotal choice. We can choose to say nothing and hope that our words
will sufficiently honor the person who's no longer here with us. Or we can step up and express
our love and appreciation while they're still here. And we can honor all those around us
who are very much alive. I call this intentional honoring
of others “Gracenotes”. And whether they’re written or spoken, they're this means of freely
and openly acknowledging someone's presence and gifts. I know in my bones that these sentiments
lessen the pain of grief and increase its grace. Like a musical grace note, they're that extra embellishment that makes something
beautiful even better. With Gracenotes, we let our family,
our friends, our kids, even our colleagues know
not just that they matter but how they matter. And these notes also help us
to overcome the illusion, the illusion that there'll always
be more time to let others know how they're impacting the world. 07:03So what do you think keeps us
from ""gracing"" each other this way? Lack of time? Fear of feeling awkward? Unresolved anger? Maybe a lack of forgiveness. 07:19With that in mind, I'll tell you
a bit about my friend Sandy. For much of her life, she had this
complicated relationship with her mom. She was holding on
to decades of resentment. Some of it was tied up
in her mom's alcoholism. But now her mom was dying of cancer. And as heart-wrenching as it was to admit, she said sometimes she wanted her to die. Sandy and I happened to go for a walk
not long after my dad passed, and I said I felt this sense of freedom
and a lack of regret, and I thought it had to be because I gave him that note
before he died. So Sandy decided to write her mom a note, and she included
an honoring set of memories about what she did love about her mom. 08:06She called me later, she said, ""You know what? It was like magic. I started liking my mom. I forgave her. I felt compassion for her. My heart got softer."" 08:26Here's the thing. When we're writing a Gracenote, you're not trying to get published
in a poetry anthology. You don't have to sound like Shakespeare. My guess is you're probably not trying
to get a job at Hallmark. Just want to sound like you. You just need to be willing to try. You're aiming for truth,
authenticity, love. What I've learned over and over
is that the pain of regret is always greater than the challenge
of writing a Gracenote. A moment of grace can be that simple
and that profound. It's an experience
that forever touches the dying and those who are left behind. 09:18So what now? You might be sitting there
thinking what you'd say or how to get started. Business groups and long-term
care groups that I speak to use what I like to call
the Mad Libs approach. Maybe you played Mad Libs
in middle school. Maybe you still play Mad Libs. It’s that fun, 
fill-in-the-blank word game. So with a little bit of Mad Libs style,
we get this easy-to-use Gracenotes road map. 09:48""You are the only person I know who ..."" 09:53""I always laugh when I think about ..."" 09:57""You will leave a legacy around ..."" 10:02Bottom line, you can't do this wrong. It's impossible. And if writing’s not your thing, what if you made a video? A drawing? Maybe you're really good
at PowerPoint decks. Could you write a grace sentence? The medium doesn't matter. What matters is the doing. 10:28What I've learned
in this journey of my own and in talking to others
about their losses, is that Gracenotes create
the sense of completeness, contentedness and calm. I vividly recall the last night
my dad was alive. By then he was unconscious,
and everyone else had gone to bed. I sat with him
with my hand softly on his. And on this unrepeatable night, I didn't have to worry
about trying to find the words to tell him all that he'd meant to me and only hope that he could
hear what I said. Instead, I could be present to his dying. I could affirm that if this
was his time to move on, that was OK. I could love him with presence
and with touch, knowing full well that my Gracenote
those many years earlier had been a sincere and thorough
rendering of his life well lived. 11:30Ever since, I've felt very little regret. And I know it's because I shared
my full heart with him before it was too late. 11:42So I hope, I deeply hope, that you don't know anyone
who's actively dying. But given the times we're in,
that may well not be the case. No matter what, I encourage you to just look around. People everywhere
are dying to be seen and heard, to know how they matter. They're dying to get your Gracenote. 12:11So that is my death wish. That you see how your note,
no matter what form it takes, is like an oasis in a desert of people who are thirsty to know
they're making a difference. Like my dad said, it's better than having
a eulogy read over a casket. 12:34Thank you. 12:36(Applause)"
2,The science behind how parents affect child development,Yuko Munakata,May 2021,"Parents, take a deep breath: how your kids turn out isn't fully on you. Of course, parenting plays an important role in shaping who children become, but psychologist Yuko Munakata offers an alternative, research-backed reality that highlights how it's just one of many factors that influence the chaotic complexity of childhood development. A rethink for anyone wondering what made them who they are today and what it means to be a good parent.", (80K),"Transcript (13 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01A few years ago, a student came up to me
after the second day of my class on parenting and child development. She hesitated for a second
and then she confessed, ""I'm really interested in this material, but I was hoping your class
would help me to become a better parent if I have kids someday."" She was disappointed. We were going to talk
about how parents do not have control in shaping who their children become. She jumped to the conclusion
that my class wouldn't help her. I was caught off guard. Would confronting the science of parenting
and child development, not be relevant to being a good parent? I hope that my class changed her mind. 00:47Parents want what's best
for their children, young and old parents, rich and poor, married and divorced. And parenting books promise to show
how to achieve the best outcomes, to address the difficult decisions
that parents face every day and in the process, to reveal why
each of us turned out the way we did. The problem is that parenting books
send conflicting messages. Tiger parenting or free-range parenting? Parent like the Dutch
to raise the happiest kids in the world or like the Germans,
to raise self-reliant children? The one consistent message
is that if your child isn't succeeding, you're doing something wrong. There's good news, though. The science supports
a totally different message that is ultimately empowering. 01:44Trying to predict
how a child will turn out based on choices made by the parents is like trying to predict a hurricane from the flap of a butterfly's wings. Do you know the butterfly, the proverbial one,
that flaps its wings in China, perturbing the atmosphere just enough
to shift wind currents that make their way to the skies
over tropical white beaches intensifying the water evaporating
from the ocean in a spiral of wind and fueling a hurricane in the Caribbean six weeks after that flutter of wings. If you are a parent, you are the butterfly flapping your wings. Your child is the hurricane,
a breathtaking force of nature. You will shape the person
your child becomes like the butterfly shapes the hurricane in complex, seemingly
unpredictable but powerful ways. The hurricane wouldn't exist
without the butterfly. 02:47""Wait,"" you might ask, what about all the successful parents
with successful children or the struggling parents
with struggling children?"" They might seem to show
the simple power of parenting. But children can be shaped by many forces
that are often intertwined, like successful parents, successful genes, successful peers and a culture of success
that they grow up in. This can make it hard to know which forces
influence who children become. ""OK,"" you might think, ""yes, it's hard to pull apart
all these possible forces, but we can make pretty good guesses
about the importance of parents."" Perhaps. 03:26Well, how many of you know
how a bicycle works? Right, you've seen people riding bikes, maybe you've ridden one yourself or even tried to teach
someone else how to do it. Just like parenting -- you've seen people doing it, maybe you've done it yourself or even tried to teach
someone else how to do it. We can feel confident about what we know. When we say we know how a bicycle works, we think we have something
in our heads like this. Something that relates the pedals
to the chain and to the wheels. But when you ask people to explain
how a bicycle works, they produce drawings like this. And like this. 04:11(Laughter) 04:13People have no idea how bicycles work. Or zippers or rainbows, or even topics they argue
passionately about. When you push people to explain
how these things work, they usually can't. Just caring about something,
like parenting, or feeling confident about it, doesn't guarantee that we understand it. And everyone can't possibly be right
about how parenting works, given how wildly beliefs have varied. 04:45Mothers in a hunter-gatherer society regretted when their children
cut themselves themselves while playing with knives, but they thought the cuts
were worth the freedom to explore. Even within one society like ours, parenting wasn't a common term
until the 1970s. Before then, parents weren't viewed
as active shapers of children's futures. Years from now, people may look back on today's views and feel just as amazed as we feel when hearing about other times and places. 05:19The science could help parents, and potential parents like my student, to understand how they actually shape
who their children become. Millions of children have been studied
to disentangle all those shaping forces that are usually intertwined. These studies follow identical
twins and fraternal twins and plain old siblings growing up together
or adopted and raised apart. And it turns out that growing up
in the same home does not make children noticeably
more alike in how successful they are, or how happy or self-reliant and so on. Imagine if you had been taken from birth and raised next door
by the family to the left and your brother or sister
had been raised next door by the family to the right, by and large, that would have made you
no more similar or different than growing up together
under the same roof. 06:19On the one hand, these findings
seem unbelievable. Think about all the ways
that parents differ from home to home and how often they argue
and whether they helicopter and how much they shower
their children with love. You would think that would matter enough to make children growing up
in the same home more alike than if they had been raised apart. But it doesn't. 06:42In 2015, a meta analysis, a study of studies, found this pattern across
thousands of studies following over 14 million twin pairs
across 39 countries. They measured over 17,000 outcomes. And the researchers concluded that every single one
of those outcomes is heritable. So genes influence who children become. But genes didn't explain everything. The environment mattered too, just something in the environment that didn't shape children growing up
in the same home to be more alike. Some people have looked at these findings and concluded that parenting
doesn't matter. That you would have become
the same person you are today, regardless of who raised you. 07:29On the other hand, and really, I should say
on the other hands, because there are many
caveats to that story, but I'll focus on one. On the other hand, these findings are not all that shocking. If you think about how the same parent could shape different
children in different ways. One child might find it helpful
when her mother provides structure. Her sister might find it's stifling. One child might think
his parents are caring when they ask questions about his friends. His brother might think
they're being nosy. One child might view
a divorce as a tragedy, while his sister sees it as a relief. Same event, different experience. 08:13My husband and I experienced
this concept 20 years ago when we were 30,000 feet
over the Atlantic, flying from Chicago to Stockholm
to work on a research project. The flight attendants
were clearing the dinner trays, people were getting ready to sleep. We hit a patch of bumpy air and a bunch of teenagers
whooped in excitement. Then all of a sudden,
the plane was plummeting, children and food carts hit the ceiling. The plane seemed to stabilize, but then plummeted again. The ceiling panels flew up
into their compartments from the force, revealing wiring inside. Debris came crumbling down on us. People were screaming and sobbing. The plane plummeted again. After an eternity,
the pilot came on and announced, ""We don't know what that was. We don't know what's coming.
Stay in your seats."" My husband came away from that experience
feeling like planes are incredibly safe. 09:15(Laughter) 09:18The airline sent a letter informing us
that we hadn't simply been falling across those thousands of feet
of clear air turbulence. The plane had been subjected
to forces greater than 2G. We learned that planes can withstand
forces many times larger. So my husband feels safe flying. He seems genuinely baffled
by how anyone could feel otherwise. I get that concept,
but only in the abstract. I've never been able to fly
the same way since. Same event, different experience. 09:53Just because an event
doesn't shape people in the same way, that doesn't mean it had no effect. Your parenting could be
shaping your children, just not in ways that lead them
to become more alike. Your parenting could be leading
your first child to become more serious, your second child to become more relaxed. Your first child to want to be like you, your second child to want
to be nothing like you. You are flapping your butterfly wings
to your hurricane children. 10:24This isn't how we typically
think about parenting. It doesn't make for simple advice. How could parenting books tell people
how to raise successful, happy, self-reliant children, if the same parenting
can lead to different outcomes for children in the same home? At this point, you might be thinking, like students in my class sometimes say, ""OK, we get it. development is complicated. And maybe it's not worth studying
because it's too complicated."" But meaning can be made from chaos. Scientists now understand
how babies go from these apparent lumps to become walking, talking,
thinking, social independent beings. They understand this process
well enough to intervene, to test newborns, for example, and treat them for a genetic condition
that used to lead to mental retardation. Scientists are developing ever more
sophisticated understanding of how parents could shape
their children's futures. 11:27Science can tell us a lot. But it will never tell us everything. So what can we do with this? First, know that parents matter. That might seem obvious, but smart people are arguing otherwise, and what seems obvious
is not always true, as we've seen. Second, know that how parents matter
is complex and difficult to predict. For anyone who has ever been a parent,
stop blaming yourself, as if you are in control
of your child's path. You have influence, but you don't have control. For anyone who has ever been a child, stop blaming your parents. 12:08(Laughter) 12:10At least for the idea
that you are defined by them. Stop blaming other parents. A recent survey of thousands of parents
revealed that 90 percent of mothers and 85 percent of fathers feel judged. Close to half feel judged all the time
or nearly all the time by people they know
and by complete strangers. These judgments probably don't reflect
what's best for the kids. How could they, given how profoundly
parenting has varied around the world and across time? And given how the same parents
can shape children under the same roof
in such different ways. Even when parents try their best,
they can't satisfy everybody. There's only so much time. 12:56This is especially true
for dragon parents. The author, Emily Rapp,
came up with this term after her baby was diagnosed
with Tay-Sachs disease. She knew then that Ronan
would never walk or talk. He would likely die before turning four. I did not know that this could also be the fate
of my firstborn son. He was born with a condition that prevents the intestine
from absorbing nutrients or water for the body. It affects one in five million babies. One in five million. It is so rare that one doctor felt confident telling us
that we would be screwed if that's what our baby had. He was the one who had
to break the news to us later. 13:58Dragon parents have a lot
to say about parenting, even though they know
their children will die young, or in my case, even if we have no idea
whether our babies will live. Emily Rapp wrote, ""We will not launch our children
into a bright and promising future, but see them into early graves."" This requires a new ferocity, a new way of thinking, a new animal. We are dragon parents, fierce and loyal and loving as hell. Our experiences have taught us
how to parent for the here and now, for the sake of parenting, for the humanity
implicit in the act itself. Parenting, I've come to understand,
is about loving my child today, now. In fact, for any parent anywhere,
that's all there is. 15:01I had thought that my expertise
in child development would help prepare me
for becoming a parent. Instead, becoming a parent helped me
to see the science in a whole new light. So third, appreciate how powerful
the moments can be because of what they mean for you
and your child right now, not because of what they mean
for your child long term, which you do not know. The activist Andrew Solomon noted, ""Though many of us take pride in how
different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different
our children are from us."" Maybe we could be less sad
if we were more realistic, if we let go of the notion that our children's futures
are in our control. If we can embrace the complexity
of our children's development that can transform how we approach
those parenting decisions we face each day and empower us to realize
how much more there is to having a child than trying to shape a specific outcome. So much more, which I appreciate every day
in moments with my firstborn son, who is thriving and with his younger brother and the unique paths they are taking. We are not screwed. 16:22(Laughter) 16:24The science of parents and children, butterflies and their hurricanes, can free people to focus
on what is most important and meaningful in our lives. This can make the experience
of being a parent and the experience of having been a child more realistic and satisfying
for everyone involved. And that, I think, is very relevant
to being a good parent."
2,A second chance for fathers to connect with their kids,"Charles C. Daniels, Jr.",Jun 2022,"Fathers have a profound impact on their children's lives, yet an estimated ten million kids in the US see their dads less than once a month. Through his advocacy and mental health center, therapist Charles C. Daniels, Jr. empowers fathers to be more present by providing mentorship and community, so they learn to forgive their own shortcomings and, most importantly, learn how to reconnect with their kids.", (45K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01Did you know that an estimated 10 million children
in the United States see their fathers less than once a month? 00:14Research tells us what happens
to boys and girls without dads or stable father figures in their lives. Poverty rates double, emotional and behavioral
health issues increase, high school dropout rates increase,
as do crime and prison rates. 00:37And I was no different. I grew up in Georgia without my father. My mother raised me. And let me tell you
something about my mom. Every day before school, she would look
me in the eyes and say to me, ""You are tall, dark and handsome."" 00:59(Laughter) 01:02(Applause) 01:07""And you can do anything
you want in this world if you put your mind to it."" But I didn't believe her. I struggled. Behavioral issues, substance abuse issues, suicidal ideation. I blamed myself
for my father being absent. 01:38I remember I was in college. In my room by myself. ""God, you have to help me use my pain."" 01:50So I went on a journey to find my father. And what I found was shocking. My father had been experiencing an issue
that he needed help in overcoming. He was experiencing his own pain. His absence was not my fault. And in a way, not his fault. Then I thought to myself, what if my father would have had
a caring group of neighbors to support him? It would have made a difference
for the both of us. 02:28Now, there's a lot of reasons that keep
fathers separated from their children. There are the ones
you might think of right away, like estrangement from a mother, substance abuse, sickness
and incarceration. But the reasons that don't get
talked about enough are the ones that exacerbate the problem. Those are the emotions
we don't talk about enough. I'm talking about shame. Guilt. And embarrassment. These emotions can cause so much harm beyond the absence. 03:19Ben was a 32-year-old father at an agency that I run
called Fathers’ UpLift, where we help fathers love,
forgive and heal. And in doing so, they learn to find the beauty
in the pain they've experienced. Now one might ask,
how can pain be beautiful? At Fathers' UpLift, we believe
that pain gives you character, strength and courage. More importantly, there is a mystery
on the other side of pain. For the population we work with, that mystery is a father's child. The warm embrace with your child
on the other side of the mystery, that is beauty. 04:13Ben spent four years
separated from his child due to co-parenting issues. restraining orders and challenges navigating
the family court. But he also experienced shame from not being able
to see his daughter daily, guilt because he was absent and embarrassment because he was unable
to spend time with his daughter on a consistent basis. 04:42Now it is imperative to note that as we stand here today, that through prior relationships
men learn to love and hate. Some of us have limited
experience with love. Therefore, relationships
that emphasize self-love play an essential role in the work we do. Lifelong relationships
are integral to our efforts, with specific emphasis
on an individual's ability to mirror new behavior and connections. 05:21Now, while many fathers like Ben
come to our agency through social service agencies
and correctional facilities, many of them come to us
through word of mouth. They come to our clinic
and can work one-on-one with a licensed therapist and coach. A team of individuals
that provide guidance, advocacy and mentorship. We also offer group therapy. In groups of five to 25 fathers or more, they share stories about their children
and comfort one another as they work to achieve a common goal. They hear stories of triumph and struggle and pour into one another
whenever there is a need. Together, we ensure
that fathers are mentally and emotionally prepared
to be in their children's lives. And when their father
has achieved his goal, he is invited to come back
and be an ambassador and pay it forward. 06:26And last but not least, we ensure that mental health providers, universities and institutions have the tools they need to engage fathers
wherever they are throughout the world, through our online
and in-person instruction. 06:43(Applause) 06:49We work with fathers
as long as they need us. Or, in other words, until they fire us. 06:56(Laughter) 06:59Now there is no easy formula here. Every dad is different. Every kid is different. Every story is different. But there are a few things
we do every time. We are loving our fathers
and the fatherless back to life. 07:19(Applause) 07:23We hug our fathers. We celebrate them on birthdays
and holidays with a call to let them know how much
we appreciate them. And we assume that they have
the power to achieve their goals. We are a consistent
source of support for them as they work to process the mistakes
they've made in the past. For the last few years, we’ve served
over 10,000 fathers in their families. 07:54(Applause) 08:01We've seen fathers accomplish goals, such as gaining shared custody
of their children, loving themselves again and gaining a newfound appreciation for everything they have
experienced in their life. All of our fathers enter our doors
feeling hopeless. But when they leave, over 90 percent of them say
they have an improved sense of identity and self-worth. We've helped fathers
released from jail and prison return home with their worth,
their dignity and their self-respect. 08:36(Applause) 08:41And of course, our work just doesn't benefit fathers. It's for the kids too. A kid blaming himself for something
he doesn't understand. The kid like I was, who struggled and who didn't understand
that fathers are human too. 09:08My father's absence inspired me to create
a safe haven for fathers nationwide. And truth be told, my father is currently leading
a life separated from me as we speak today. Unfortunately, it is not a perfect ending. But it is an important one. It sheds light on the fact
that fathers hurt too. And it is our responsibility to love them
back to life whenever the need exist. 09:43As I stand on the stage, I can't stop thinking
about my seven-year-old son, Clayton, and my one-year-old daughter,
SaMya Grace. 09:55The other day, I asked Clayton, ""What kind of father am I?"" 10:01He looked at me and said, ""Um, you have a mustache,"" 10:06(Laughter) 10:08""Long hair,"" this was before
the haircut, may I add. 10:11(Laughter) 10:13""And even a new computer."" 10:16I was like, ""OK, this is true, son."" 10:20He goes on to say, ""I love it when you buy me games,""
before hugging me -- 10:25(Laughter) 10:28And running back to his room. 10:30(Laughter) 10:33And SaMya Grace. Every time I ask her for a kiss, she puckers up her lips and she runs
to kiss me with an enormous smile. That makes my day every time. When moments like these occur, I understand that I have
the privilege to be present, unlike many of the fathers that walk
through our doors for the first time. Like them, I am far from perfect. Despite my mistakes, my greatest achievement
is being Clayton and SaMya's father. 11:13(Applause) 11:19Millions of fathers today, regardless of their location, can say the same thing. 11:31I must admit, if it had not been
for the individuals in my life that reminded me of how valuable I was, I would not be here today. I'm more than thankful for them
that they loved me back to life. 11:48Fathers that have been absent,
regardless of their past mistakes, deserve a lifeline. And if we are deserving, so are the ones who have lost their way. 12:04Take a moment with me. Fifteen seconds. And I'll keep the time. Think about the people who loved you
when you lost your way. Who huged you when you needed it. Who assumed best intention. Who validated you. And embraced you
even when you felt undeserving. Whoever came to mind, try, just try and be that to someone else. 12:40Thank you. 12:41(Applause)"
2,The mathematics of love,Hannah Fry,Feb 2015,"Finding the right mate is no cakewalk -- but is it even mathematically likely? In a charming talk, mathematician Hannah Fry shows patterns in how we look for love, and gives her top three tips (verified by math!) for finding that special someone.", (169K),"Transcript (35 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиҚазақ тіліעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love. Now, I think that we can all agree that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love. 00:10(Laughter) 00:11But it's not just because
of our dashing personalities, superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases. It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. 00:26Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled, ""Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend"" -- 00:31(Laughter) 00:33Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love. Now, Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the UK, all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him, somebody in the right age range, somebody with a university degree, somebody he's likely to get on well with, somebody who's likely to be attractive, somebody who's likely
to find him attractive. 00:56(Laughter) 00:59And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK. 01:04(Laughter) 01:05It's not looking very good, is it Peter? Now, just to put that into perspective, that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are. And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance of bumping into any one
of these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians don't really bother
going on nights out anymore. 01:31The thing is that I personally
don't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know,
just as well as all of you do, that love doesn't really work like that. Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
and rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got something
that it can offer us, because, love, as with most of life,
is full of patterns and mathematics is, ultimately,
all about the study of patterns. Patterns from predicting the weather
to the fluctuations in the stock market, to the movement of the planets
or the growth of cities. And if we're being honest,
none of those things are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either. Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love. And so, to try to persuade you of how totally amazing, excellent
and relevant mathematics is, I want to give you my top three
mathematically verifiable tips for love. 02:38(Laughter) 02:40OK, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating. So my favorite online dating
website is OkCupid, not least because it was started
by a group of mathematicians. Now, because they're mathematicians, they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade. And they've been trying
to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we interact
with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out
that on an online dating website, how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are, and actually, having people
think that you're ugly can work to your advantage. 03:27(Laughter) 03:28Let me show you how this works. In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid, you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five. Now, if we compare this score,
the average score, to how many messages
a selection of people receive, you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website. 03:52This is the graph the OkCupid guys
have come up with. And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get. But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular
than people down here, even though they have the same
score of attractiveness? And the reason why is that it's not just
straightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustrate
their findings with an example. So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example, everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either. If you compare Portia de Rossi
to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker, now, a lot of people,
myself included, I should say, think that Sarah Jessica Parker
is seriously fabulous and possibly one
of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked
on the face of the Earth. But some other people,
i.e., most of the Internet ... 04:54(Laughter) 04:56seem to think that she looks
a bit like a horse. 04:58(Laughter) 05:01Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to give
them a score between one and five I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote
would be very different. So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees
that she's very beautiful, whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread
that makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people
think that you're attractive, you're actually better off having some other people
think that you're a massive minger. That's much better
than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. 05:48Now, I think this begins
to make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages. So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive, but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested. That means there's
less competition for you and it's an extra incentive
for you to get in touch. Whereas compare that
to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody
is going to think they're attractive. Well, why would you bother
humiliating yourself, let's be honest? But here's where the really
interesting part comes. Because when people choose the pictures
that they use on an online dating website, they often try to minimize the things that they think some people
will find unattractive. The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight deliberately choosing
a very cropped photo, 06:33(Laughter) 06:35or bald men, for example, deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats. But actually this is the opposite
of what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really, instead, play up to whatever it is
that makes you different, even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive. Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway, and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage. 07:00OK, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner. So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises
of how do you then convert that success into longer-term happiness, and in particular, how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down? Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along
and shows you any interest at all. But, equally, you don't really
want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness. As my favorite author,
Jane Austen, puts it, ""An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel
or inspire affection again."" 07:41(Laughter) 07:44Thanks a lot, Jane. What do you know about love? 07:46(Laughter) 07:47So the question is then, how do you know when
is the right time to settle down, given all the people
that you can date in your lifetime? Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine, then, that you start dating when you're 15 and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35. And there's a number of people that you could potentially
date across your lifetime, and they'll be at varying
levels of goodness. Now the rules are that once
you cash in and get married, you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had, and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind. In my experience at least, I find that typically people
don't much like being recalled years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me. 08:33So the math says then
that what you should do in the first 37 percent
of your dating window, you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential. 08:43(Laughter) 08:45And then, you should pick
the next person that comes along that is better than everybody
that you've seen before. So here's the example. Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact, that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks. For instance, imagine
if your perfect partner appeared during your first 37 percent. Now, unfortunately,
you'd have to reject them. 09:18(Laughter) 09:22Now, if you're following the maths, I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyone
you've seen before, so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone. 09:32(Laughter) 09:34Probably surrounded by cats ... 09:36(Laughter) 09:37nibbling at your remains. 09:39OK, another risk is,
let's imagine, instead, that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people. That's OK, because
you're in your rejection phase, so that's fine, you can reject them. But then imagine
the next person to come along is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ... 10:01(Laughter) 10:02than everybody that you've seen before. Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them ... 10:08(Laughter) 10:09and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal. Sorry about that. But I do think that there's an opportunity
here for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this. 10:20(Laughter) 10:21""My darling husband,
you are marginally less terrible than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."" 10:26(Laughter) 10:28It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage. 10:31(Laughter) 10:33OK, so this method doesn't give you
a 100 percent success rate, but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better. And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types of fish which follow and employ
this exact strategy. So they reject every possible
suitor that turns up in the first 37 percent
of the mating season, and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier than all of the fish
that they've seen before. I also think that subconsciously,
humans, we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of time
to play the field, get a feel for the marketplace
or whatever when we're young. And then we only start looking seriously
at potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid-to-late 20s. I think this is conclusive proof,
if ever it were needed, that everybody's brains are prewired
to be just a little bit mathematical. 11:27OK, so that was Top Tip #2. Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce. OK, so let's imagine then
that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into
a lifelong relationship with them. Now, I like to think that everybody
would ideally like to avoid divorce, apart from, I don't know,
Piers Morgan's wife, maybe? 11:48(Laughter) 11:50But it's a sad fact of modern life that one in two marriages
in the States ends in divorce, with the rest of the world
not being far behind. Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps for thinking that the arguments
that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate
for mathematical investigation. For one thing, it's very hard to know what you should be measuring
or what you should be quantifying. But this didn't stop a psychologist,
John Gottman, who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of couples
having a conversation and recorded, well,
everything you can think of. So he recorded what was said
in the conversation, he recorded their skin conductivity, he recorded their facial expressions, their heart rates, their blood pressure, basically everything apart from whether
or not the wife was actually always right, which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the most
important predictors for whether or not a couple
is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each partner
was being in the conversation. 12:59Now, couples that were very low-risk scored a lot more positive points
on Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships, by which I mean,
probably going to get divorced, they found themselves getting
into a spiral of negativity. Now just by using these very simple ideas, Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple
was going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed up
with a mathematician, James Murray, that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spirals
and how they occur. And the results that they found, I think, are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting. So these equations predict how the wife
or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation, how positive or negative
they're going to be. And these equations depend on the mood of the person
when they're on their own, the mood of the person when
they're with their partner, but most importantly, they depend on how much the husband and wife
influence one another. 14:02Now, I think it's important
to point out at this stage, that these exact equations
have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries
in an arms race. 14:15(Laughter) 14:18So that an arguing couple
spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce is actually mathematically equivalent
to the beginning of a nuclear war. 14:28(Laughter) 14:31But the really important term
in this equation is the influence that people
have on one another, and in particular, something called
""the negativity threshold."" Now, the negativity threshold, you can think of as
how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get
really pissed off, and vice versa. Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person
to have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold. Where couples let things go and only brought things up
if they really were a big deal. But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples,
or the most successful couples, are the ones with a really low
negativity threshold. These are the couples
that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other
some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship, that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal. 15:44Now of course, it takes a bit more
than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising
to have a successful relationship. But I think that it's quite interesting to know that there is really
mathematical evidence to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger. 16:02So those are my top three tips of how maths can help you
with love and relationships. But I hope, that aside from
their use as tips, they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics. Because for me, equations
and symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us, from how the world works to how we behave. So I hope that perhaps,
for just a couple of you, a little bit of insight
into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have
a little bit more love for mathematics. 16:40Thank you. 16:41(Applause)"
2,A little-told tale of sex and sensuality,Shereen El Feki,Jan 2014,"“If you really want to know a people, start by looking inside their bedrooms,"" says Shereen El Feki, who traveled through the Middle East for five years, talking to people about sex. While those conversations reflected rigid norms and deep repression, El Feki also discovered that sexual conservatism in the Arab world is a relatively new thing. She wonders: could a re-emergence of public dialogue lead to more satisfying, and safer, sex lives?", (73K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So when I was in Morocco, in Casablanca, not so long ago, I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception,
pregnancy, and delivery. 00:19It was a remarkable tale, but Faiza saved the best for last. ""You know, I am a virgin,"" she told me. ""I have two medical certificates to prove it."" 00:33This is the modern Middle East, where two millennia after the coming of Christ, virgin births are still a fact of life. 00:42Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard 
over the years, traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now, I know this might sound like a dream job, or possibly a highly dubious occupation, 00:58but for me, it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots. 01:07Like so many who straddle East and West, I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better
understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from 
my background in HIV/AIDS, as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic
in the Middle East and North Africa, which is one of only two regions in the world
where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise. 01:35Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society, because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage: in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, 
in gender and generations. As I found, if you really want to know a people, you start by looking inside their bedrooms. 02:01Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines -- these are topics you are not supposed 
to challenge in word or deed. 02:13The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that, in uprisings which have blossomed 
across the region since 2011. Now while those in power, old and new, continue to cling to business as usual, millions are still pushing back, and pushing forward to what they hope
will be a better life. 02:36That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected, with the rise of such groups as the 
Muslim Brotherhood. And some people, at least, are starting 
to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. 02:54You know, as for that third red line, 
that off-limits subject, what do you think it might be? 03:00Audience: Sex. 03:01Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you. 03:02Audience: Sex. 03:03SEF: Again, please don't be shy. 03:05Audience: Sex. 03:06SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter) Across the Arab region, the only accepted
context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot, you can't 
move out of your parents' place, and you're not supposed to be having sex, and you're definitely not supposed 
to be having children. 03:37It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault, any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex, against condoms, against abortion, against homosexuality, you name it. 03:59Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was 
not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region
extoll premarital chastity, in a patriarchy, boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage, and people more or less turn a blind eye. 04:21Not so for women, who are expected to be virgins 
on their wedding night -- that is, to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern, this is a matter of family honor, 
and in particular, men's honor. 04:39And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve 
this tiny piece of anatomy -- from female genital mutilation, to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery. 04:52Faiza chose a different route: non-vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this, because there's so little 
sexuality education in schools, and so little communication in the family. 05:11When her condition became hard to hide, Faiza's mother helped her flee 
her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at 
a hospital in Casablanca, the man who offered to help her, instead tried to rape her. 05:38Sadly, Faiza is not alone. In Egypt, where my research is focused, I have seen plenty of trouble 
in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married, because marriage has become 
a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden
of costs in married life, but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers 
of the recent uprisings, and it is one of the reasons for the 
rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. 06:12There are career women who want to get married, but can't find a husband, because they defy gender expectations, or as one young female doctor 
in Tunisia put it to me, ""The women, they are becoming more and more open. But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."" 06:32And then there are men and women who 
cross the heterosexual line, who have sex with their own sex, or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws
which punish their activities, even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma, with family despair, and with religious fire and brimstone. 06:57Now, it's not as if it's all rosy 
in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness, greater sexual happiness in their married lives, but are at a loss of how to achieve it, especially wives, who are afraid 
of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. 07:16And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families, often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming 
sex trade across the Arab region. 07:32Now raise your hand if any of 
this is sounding familiar to you, from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world
has a monopoly on sexual hangups. 07:46And although we don't yet have
an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening 
inside bedrooms across the Arab region, It's pretty clear that 
something is not right. Double standards for men and women, sex as a source of shame, family control limiting individual choices, and a vast gulf between appearance and reality: what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to, and a general reluctance to move 
beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. 08:23As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me, ""Here, sex is the opposite of sport. Football, everybody talks about it, but hardly anyone plays. But sex, everybody is doing it, but nobody wants to talk about it.""
(Laughter) 08:40(Music) (In Arabic) 08:51SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice, which if you follow it,
will make you happy in life. 08:58When your husband reaches out to you, when he seizes a part of your body, sigh deeply and look at him lustily. 09:06When he penetrates you with his penis, try to talk flirtatiously and 
move yourself in harmony with him. 09:14Hot stuff! And it might sound that these handy hints come from ""The Joy of Sex"" or YouPorn. But in fact, they come from
a 10th-century Arabic book called ""The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"" which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia, and everything in between. 09:34The Encyclopedia is just one 
in a long line of Arabic erotica, much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad, there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex: not just its problems, but also its pleasures, and not just for men, but also for women. A thousand years ago, we used to have 
whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature, position and preference, a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body 
of the woman you see on this page. 10:17Today, this history is largely unknown 
in the Arab region. Even by educated people, who often
feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do
in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks
a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. 10:36But while the West has opened on sex, what we found is that Arab societies appear
to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors, this closing down is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process, one which has gained ground with the rise 
of Islamic conservatism since the late 1970s. ""Just say no"" is what conservatives 
around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region, they brand these attempts
as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab
and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control: sex wrapped up in religion. 11:32But history shows us that 
even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day, there have been times of greater pragmatism, and tolerance, and a willingness
to consider other interpretations: be it abortion, or masturbation, or even 
the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white,
as conservatives would have us believe. In these, as in so many other matters, Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray. (Laughter) 12:08Over my travels, I've met men and women 
across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum -- sexologists who are trying
to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages, innovators who are managing to get 
sexuality education into schools, small groups of men and women, lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual, who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support. Women, and increasingly men,
who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers
protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards, and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society, and critically,
stay with their kids. 13:06Now these efforts are small, 
they're often underfunded, and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that, in the long run, times are changing, and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region
through dramatic confrontation, beating or indeed baring of breasts, but rather through negotiation. 13:33What we're talking here is not about a 
sexual revolution, but a sexual evolution, 
learning from other parts of the world, adapting to local conditions, forging our own path,
not following one blazed by another. That path, I hope, will one day lead us 
to the right to control our own bodies, and to access the information 
and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely, to marry whom we choose, 
to choose our own partners, to be sexually active or not,
to decide whether to have children and when, all this without violence or force or discrimination. 14:22Now we are very far from this 
across the Arab region, and so much needs to change: law, education, media, the economy, the list goes on and on, and it is the work of a generation, at least. 14:40But it begins with a journey that I myself have made, asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has
only served to strengthen my faith, and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities 
where I once only saw absolutes. 15:01Now given the turmoil in many
countries in the Arab region, talking about sex, 
challenging the taboos, seeking alternatives might sound like
something of a luxury. 15:13But at this critical moment in history, if we do not anchor freedom and justice, dignity and equality, privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,
in our sexual lives, we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. 15:32The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,
and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. 15:42Thank you. 15:43(Applause)"
2,There's more to life than being happy,Emily Esfahani Smith,Sep 2017,"Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but what if there's a more fulfilling path?

was pursuing happiness. Everyone said the path
to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment. But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift. And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too. 00:28footnotefootnoteEventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy. But what I discovered there
changed my life. The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy. And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising
around the world, and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America. Even though life is getting
objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone. There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people, and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it. Sooner or later, I think we all wonder: Is this all there is? And according to the research,
what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness. It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life. 01:30footnotefootnoteBut that raised some questions for me. Is there more to life than being happy? And what's the difference
between being happy and having meaning in life? Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment. Meaning, though, is deeper. The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you. Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path. And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer. 02:19So this all made me wonder: How can we each live more meaningfully? To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life. And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives. 02:49footnotefootnoteThe first pillar is belonging. Belonging comes
from being in relationships where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well. But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are. True belonging springs from love. It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others. 03:20Here's an example. Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York. They don't just conduct
a transaction, though. They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans. But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change, and the vendor said, ""Don't worry about it."" But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need to make change. But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back. He was hurt. He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him. 04:02footnotefootnoteI think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it. I do. I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them. I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me. These acts devalue others. They make them feel
invisible and unworthy. But when you lead with love,
you create a bond that lifts each of you up. 04:25footnotefootnoteFor many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends. For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose. Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy. Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give. A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people. Many parents tell me, ""My purpose is raising my children."" The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others. Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work. That's how we contribute and feel needed. But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation -- these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too. Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder. Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work, but purpose gives you
something to live for, some ""why"" that drives you forward. 05:31footnotefootnoteThe third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence. Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected
to a higher reality. For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art. For another person, it was at church. For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing. Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place. These transcendent
experiences can change you. One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute. But afterwards
they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone. 06:21footnotefootnoteBelonging, purpose, transcendence. Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people. The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself
about yourself. Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity. It helps you understand
how you became you. But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them. Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret
and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts. 06:59footnotefootnoteI met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football. After his injury, Emeka told himself, ""My life was great playing football, but now look at me."" People who tell stories like this -- ""My life was good. Now it's bad."" -- tend to be more anxious and depressed. And that was Emeka for a while. But with time, he started
to weave a different story. His new story was, ""Before my injury,
my life was purposeless. I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy. But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."" That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life. After telling the new story to himself, Emeka started mentoring kids, and he discovered what his purpose was: serving others. The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a ""redemptive story,"" where the bad is redeemed by the good. People leading meaningful
lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love. 08:08But what makes people
change their stories? Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained. That's what Emeka did. You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful. After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle. But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you. 08:42Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars. My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal. Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi. Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories. Their practice also involved
serving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind
even when people wronged you. But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego. 09:28Eventually, I left home for college and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life, I felt unmoored. And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living. That's what set me on this journey. Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning. The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply. 09:54footnotefootnoteOf course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones. Gangs, cults: these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars and give people
something to live and die for. But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives. We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves. But living a meaningful life takes work. It's an ongoing process. As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story. And sometimes we can get off track. 10:36Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father. Several months after
I graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him. He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about
was needing to live so he could be there
for my brother and me, and this gave him the will
to fight for life. When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra. He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth if he died. 11:21My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi. It's a humble life, but a good life. Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live: love. His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names -- these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived. That's the story he tells himself. 11:47That's the power of meaning. Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you
something to hold on to. 12:00Thank you. 12:01(Applause)"
2,The brain in love,Helen Fisher,Jul 2008,"Why do we crave love so much, even to the point that we would die for it? To learn more about our very real, very physical need for romantic love, Helen Fisher and her research team took MRIs of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped.", (217K),"Transcript (34 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىमराठीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I and my colleagues Art Aron
and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were happily in love,
15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting
our third experiment: studying people who report
that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. So, this is the short story
of that research. 00:24In the jungles of Guatemala,
in Tikal, stands a temple. It was built by the grandest Sun King,
of the grandest city-state, of the grandest civilization
of the Americas, the Mayas. His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. He stood over six feet tall. He lived into his 80s, and he was buried beneath
this monument in 720 AD. And Mayan inscriptions proclaim
that he was deeply in love with his wife. So, he built a temple
in her honor, facing his. And every spring and autumn,
exactly at the equinox, the sun rises behind his temple, and perfectly bathes her temple
with his shadow. And as the sun sets
behind her temple in the afternoon, it perfectly bathes
his temple with her shadow. After 1,300 years, these two lovers
still touch and kiss from their tomb. 01:24Around the world, people love. They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love. They tell myths and legends about love. They pine for love, they live for love,
they kill for love, and they die for love. As Walt Whitman once said,
""O I would stake all for you."" Anthropologists have found evidence
of romantic love in 170 societies. They've never found a society
that did not have it. 01:54But love isn't always a happy experience. In one study of college students,
they asked a lot of questions about love, but the two that stood out
to me the most were: ""Have you ever been rejected
by somebody who you really loved?"" And the second question was: ""Have you ever dumped somebody
who really loved you?"" And almost 95 percent of both men
and women said yes to both. Almost nobody gets out of love alive. 02:22So, before I start telling you
about the brain, I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful
love poem on Earth. There's other love poems that are,
of course, just as good, but I don't think this one
can be surpassed. It was told by an anonymous
Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896. And here it is. I've never had the opportunity
to say it before. ""Fire runs through my body
with the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body
with the fires of my love for you. Pain like a boil about to burst
with my love for you, consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love? I am told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here. My body is numb with grief. Remember what I said, my love. Goodbye, my love, goodbye."" Emily Dickinson once wrote,
""Parting is all we need to know of hell."" How many people have suffered in all the millions of years
of human evolution? How many people around the world are dancing with elation
at this very minute? Romantic love is one of the most powerful
sensations on Earth. 03:48So, several years ago,
I decided to look into the brain and study this madness. Our first study of people
who were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to say
very little about it. We found activity in a tiny,
little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells
called the A10 cells, cells that actually make
dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed, this part, the VTA,
is part of the brain's reward system. It's way below your cognitive
thinking process. It's below your emotions. It's part of what we call
the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving. In fact, the same brain region
where we found activity becomes active also
when you feel the rush of cocaine. 04:39But romantic love is much more
than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine. Romantic love is an obsession,
it possesses you. You lose your sense of self. You can't stop thinking
about another human being. Somebody is camping in your head. As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
""My longing had no time when it ceases."" Wild is love. And the obsession can get worse
when you've been rejected. 05:08So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,
the neuroscientists on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine
after they had just been dumped. It was very difficult actually,
putting these people in the machine, because they were in such bad shape. 05:23(Laughter) 05:27So anyway, we found activity
in three brain regions. We found activity in the brain region, in exactly the same brain region
associated with intense romantic love. What a bad deal. You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do
is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life --
but no, you just love them harder. As the poet Terence,
the Roman poet once said, he said, ""The less my hope,
the hotter my love."" And indeed, we now know why. Two thousand years later,
we can explain this in the brain. That brain system -- the reward system for wanting, for motivation,
for craving, for focus -- becomes more active
when you can't get what you want. In this case, life's greatest prize:
an appropriate mating partner. 06:14We found activity
in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated
with calculating gains and losses. You're lying there,
you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating what went wrong. What have I lost? As a matter of fact, Lucy and I
have a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, ""Oh, you're a bad pony,
I'm not going to bet on you."" And indeed, it's this part of the brain, the core of the nucleus accumbens, that is becoming active
as you're measuring your gains and losses. It's also the brain region
that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks
for huge gains and huge losses. 07:03Last but not least,
we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment
to another individual. No wonder people suffer around the world,
and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love, not only are you engulfed
with feelings of romantic love, but you're feeling deep
attachment to this individual. Moreover, this brain circuit
for reward is working, and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all,
to win life's greatest prize. 07:41So, what have I learned
from this experiment that I would like to tell the world? Foremost, I have come to think that romantic love is a drive,
a basic mating drive. Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you looking
for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy on just one at a time,
conserve your mating energy, and start the mating process
with this single individual. I think of all the poetry
that I've read about romantic love, what sums it up best
is something that is said by Plato over 2,000 years ago. He said, ""The god of love
lives in a state of need. It is a need, it is an urge,
it is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst,
it's almost impossible to stamp out."" I've also come to believe
that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction
when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction
when it's going poorly. 08:38And indeed, it has all
of the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person,
you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormous
risks to win this person. And it's got the three main
characteristics of addiction: tolerance, you need to see them
more, and more, and more; withdrawals; and last: relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair. It's been about eight months,
she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving along
in her car the other day, and suddenly she heard a song
on the car radio that reminded her of this man. Not only did the instant
craving come back, but she had to pull over
from the side of the road and cry. So, one thing I would like
the medical community, and the legal community,
and even the college community, to see if they can understand,
that indeed, romantic love is one of the most addictive
substances on Earth. 09:30I would also like to tell the world
that animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything
that comes along. Too old, too young, too scruffy,
too stupid, and they won't do it. Unless you're stuck
in a laboratory cage -- and you know, if you spend
your entire life in a little box, you're not going to be as picky
about who you have sex with, but I've looked in a hundred species, and everywhere in the wild,
animals have favorites. As a matter of fact,
ethologists know this. There are over eight words
for what they call ""animal favoritism:"" selective proceptivity, mate choice,
female choice, sexual choice. And indeed, there are now
three academic articles in which they've looked
at this attraction, which may only last for a second, but it's a definite attraction, and either this same brain region,
this reward system, or the chemicals of that reward
system are involved. In fact, I think animal attraction
can be instant -- you can see an elephant
instantly go for another elephant. And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call
""love at first sight."" 10:38People have often asked me whether what I know about love
has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say, ""Hardly."" You can know every single ingredient
in a piece of chocolate cake, and then when you sit down
and eat that cake, you can still feel that joy. And certainly, I make all the same
mistakes that everybody else does too, but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion, really,
for all human life. As a matter of fact, in New York,
I often catch myself looking in baby carriages
and feeling a little sorry for the tot. And in fact, sometimes
I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intense
this brain system is. Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague, Art Aron -- putting people who are reporting
that they are still in love, in a long-term relationship,
into the functional MRI. We've put five people in so far, and indeed, we found exactly
the same thing. They're not lying. The brain areas associated
with intense romantic love still become active, 25 years later. 11:54There are still many questions
to be answered and asked about romantic love. The question that I'm working on
right this minute -- and I'm only going to say it
for a second, and then end -- is, why do you fall in love
with one person, rather than another? I never would have
even thought to think of this, but Match.com, the Internet dating site, came to me three years ago
and asked me that question. And I said, I don't know. I know what happens in the brain,
when you do become in love, but I don't know why you fall in love
with one person rather than another. And so, I've spent
the last three years on this. And there are many reasons
that you fall in love with one person rather than another,
that psychologists can tell you. And we tend to fall in love with somebody
from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence,
of good looks, the same religious values. Your childhood certainly plays a role,
but nobody knows how. And that's about it, that's all they know. No, they've never found the way two personalities
fit together to make a good relationship. 12:51So, it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you
towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire
to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin,
estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four
very broad personality types associated with the ratios
of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site
that I have created, called Chemistry.com, I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree
you express these chemicals, and I'm watching who chooses who to love. And 3.7 million people have taken
the questionnaire in America. About 600,000 people have taken it
in 33 other countries. I'm putting the data together now, and at some point --
there will always be magic to love, but I think I will come closer
to understanding why it is you can walk into a room
and everybody is from your background, your same general level
of intelligence, good looks, and you don't feel
pulled towards all of them. I think there's biology to that. I think we're going to end up,
in the next few years, to understand all kinds
of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person
rather than another. 14:06So, I will close with this. These are my older people. Faulkner said, ""The past is not dead,
it's not even past."" Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage
from our yesteryear in the human brain. And so, there's one thing that makes me
pursue my understanding of human nature, and this reminds me of it. These are two women. Women tend to get intimacy
differently than men do. Women get intimacy
from face-to-face talking. We swivel towards each other, we do what we call
the ""anchoring gaze"" and we talk. This is intimacy to women. I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby
in front of your face, cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words. Men tend to get intimacy
from side-by-side doing. As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away. 15:00(Laughter) 15:02I think it comes from millions of years
sitting behind the bush, looking straight ahead, trying to hit
that buffalo on the head with a rock. I think, for millions of years,
men faced their enemies, they sat side-by-side with friends. So my final statement is: love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. 15:27Thank you. 15:28(Applause)"

In this performance, Byrne appears as a hologram named Pilar, transmitting a story of love and loss back to us from a near future when humans have colonized the universe.

Hope so. I have no idea if you're seeing this, but I'm just going to look ahead
and trust that you're there. I've drawn a semicircle
in the sand in front of me so I don't walk past it
and look like I'm floating in midair. 00:26footnotefootnoteRight now I'm standing in the open air, on a beach under a palm tree, in the exact spot
where your stage used to be. I have 12 minutes with you. I set a limit. My wife Navid once said that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy. For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo. But we only had three days to make it, and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind. But she did it, and it's perfect. And she looked at it and said, ""Proof of concept --
creation needs constraint."" So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you
about my greatest discovery. 01:24footnotefootnoteFor my whole life, my obsession
has been eternal life, as I know it is so many of yours. You may be happy to know
that your research will pay off. I am 318 years old. The average human lifespan
is now 432 years, and my work has been to extend
the human lifespan indefinitely. And I've never questioned that someday, we'll reach a point
where we'll be content. But the opposite keeps happening: the longer we live,
the longer we want to live, the less we want to die. 02:03Who can blame us? The universe is so big. There won't ever not be more to see. Just yesterday, I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa and sail from island to island
all over the planet, and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter. And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean. And then there are others
where there's no one and there never has been, and so you go just for the pleasure
of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before. You could spend 400 years doing just that. 02:51footnotefootnoteRight now the Moon is rising
in the Northeast. I can see the cities on it
with my naked eye. They're connected like nerve clusters: Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator. And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility. 03:12footnotefootnoteThat's where Navid and I met. We were both artists downtown. The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square, and we bumped shoulders. And I turned to apologize and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything, said, ""Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"" And first of all, I thought,
""Who the hell are you?"" But second, the question annoyed me, because the answer is so simple. I said, ""We didn't pass through each other because elementary particles have mass and because the space
between elementary particles is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass, and we've known that for 800 years."" She must have been in one of those moods where she likes to mess with strangers. Or maybe she was just flirting with me, because she looked at me and said,
""I thought you'd say that. Think deeper."" And then she took off her belt, this belt that I'm wearing now, and she said, ""Our universe is built
so that particles have mass. Without that basic constraint, we'd have just passed right through
each other at the speed of light and never even known."" 04:36And that's how our romance began. Navid and I never ran out of things to talk about. Never. It was incredible. It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together and we kept arriving at new vistas, and these new, perfect
constellations of words would come out of us to describe them. And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them, and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up. Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread, and that we were always
adding in a little more flour and a little more water, and folding it in and turning it over and never getting around to baking it. 05:32footnotefootnoteIf my obsession was eternal life,
Navid's obsession was touch. She had a genius for it. All of her work revolved around it. My body was like a canvas for her, and she would draw her fingertip
down over my face so slowly that I couldn't feel it moving. And she was obsessed with the exact moment when I would stop being able to tell
the difference between her body and mine. Or she would just lie across me
and dig her shoulder into mine and say, ""Pilar, why does
this feel so good?"" I'd say, ""I don't know!"" And she always had a facetious answer
for her facetious question, but the answer I remember today is, ""It feels good because the universe chose
its constraints, and we are its art."" 06:41It's always funny what you think
the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be. In your time, scientists thought
humans could freeze themselves and wake up in the future. And they did -- but then they died. In your time, scientists thought
humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years. And they did, but eventually, they died anyway. In your time, Earth
is the only place people live. In my time, Earth is the place
people come to die. 07:25footnotefootnoteSo when Navid started to show the signs, our friends assumed I would do
what everyone does, which is say goodbye
and send her to Earth, so that none of us
would have to look at her or be around her
or think about her and her ... failure to keep living. More than anything, they didn't want to be around
her actual physical body. They kept referring to it as ""declining,"" even though she herself
was fascinated by it, the changes it was going through, following the rules of its nature
day by day, independent of her will. I did send Navid to Earth. But I came with her. I remember a friend of ours,
just before we left, said, ""I just think it's arrogant, like the rules don't apply to you,
like you think your love is that special."" But I did. 08:32So, even here on Earth, I kept working on how to extend life. It didn't occur to me that there could be any other response. I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me that day in Azadi Square, that without that basic constraint -- a universe that granted mass to matter -- we would not exist. That's one rule. Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy. And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass. I know. I tried everything. I tried creating a photon box
where the Higgs field was altered. I tried recording all
subatomic movements in my body and replaying them on closed loop. Nothing worked. 09:21But my final innovation
was to create a coil dimension with the boundaries of a body
in which time moved infinitely slower, but whose projection would appear
to move in normal time. That body would then appear
in our universe as a hologram -- here but not here. When I realized I'd done it, I ran to her room, so happy to tell her I'd done it, moving through space
almost normally to all eyes, even to my own, and went to lie down next to her, and forgot, and fell right through her. I'd found a way to eternal life, at the expense of the one thing
Navid loved most, which was to touch and be touched. And she threw me out. I still got to watch, though. 10:39Humans live 400 years now, and we still die. And when death comes, the dying still pick at their bedsheets, and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides, and their breaths get further
and further apart, like they're falling asleep. 11:09I've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure. And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet. But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends. Maybe that's the paradox: constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom. 11:39(Sighs) 11:45There was a thunderstorm
here this morning. There is another forecast for tonight, but for now the sky is clear. I can't feel the wind here, but I just asked one of the caretakers
who passed by what it felt like, and she said it felt warm,
like melted butter. An answer worthy of my wife. I have to find my way back to the flesh. Until then, I take up no space
but the space you give me."
3,Rethinking thinking,Trevor Maber,Sep 2018,"Every day, we meet people and process our interactions-- making inferences and developing beliefs about the world around us. In this lesson, Trevor Maber introduces us to the idea of a 'ladder of inference' and a process for rethinking the way we interact. [Directed by Biljana Labovic, narrated by Trevor Maber].", (24K),"Transcript (21 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийՀայրենעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Tom Carter, TranslatorBedirhan Cinar, Reviewer00:14Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. ""That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?"" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. ""That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot."" And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. ""My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk."" But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations
did you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs."
3,The necessity of normalizing queer love,Panti Bliss,Jun 2020,The public displays of affection that straight couples take for granted every day can be outright dangerous for queer couples to practice -- what do you do when simply holding hands with a loved one can be considered a political act? Irish activist Panti Bliss shares what it's like to navigate such a world and highlights the importance of normalizing queer love in public spaces., (16K),"Transcript (8 Languages)DeutschEnglishFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroČeštinaСрпски, Srpskiالعربية日本語Liam Regan, TranslatorDenise RQ, Reviewer00:08Hi! Hi! I am forty-five years old. I know I look amazing, thank you.
(Laughter) I am forty-five years old and I have never once unselfconsciously held hands
with a lover in public. I am forty-five years old
and I have never once casually, comfortably, carelessly
held hands with a partner in public. I don't know how many of you
can even imagine what that might be like because, of course,
it's a small thing, isn't it, holding hands with a lover in public? And it's not that nobody wanted to,
it's just that we didn't feel comfortable. Now, like many gay people,
when I was younger, in my young life, I struggled at one time against being gay. I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be this thing
that I didn't really understand. This thing that I had learned
was shameful or jokeworthy. But when I eventually did
sort of understand and come to accept who and what I am, I have never since that moment, never once, have I ever wished
that it turned out differently! I am thoroughly, deeply, delightedly,
happy to be gay! (Applause) It suits me! (Laughter)
I am really good at it! (Laughter) And yet, everyday
I am jealous of straight people, because that private, little, small,
intimate gesture of affection has never once been mine. Everyday I see young, straight couples
walking through the park and they are casually holding hands
and I am jealous of them! I see a teenage couple at a bus stop and she is leaning into him,
and her hand is in his, and both of their hands are
tucked into his jacket pocket for warmth, and I am jealous of that teenage couple! I will sometimes see a man
who unconsciously put his hand, a protective arm,
around his girlfriend and she'll link her fingers through his,
and I am jealous of that! Maybe you're on Grafton Street
and you see an older lady and she gestures to draw
her husband's attention to something in the window, and without even thinking
he just takes her hand and they stand there
peering into the window discussing whatever it is
that drew their attention and their hands are
just carelessly joined together, and I am jealous of that! Because gay people do not
get to hold hands in public without first considering the risk. Gay people do not get to put an arm
through another arm or put a hand on a boyfriend's waist
without first considering what the possible
consequences might be. We look around to see:
where are we, who's around, is it late at night?
What kind of area is it? Are there bored teenagers
hanging around looking for amusement? Are there bunches of lads
standing outside a pub? And if we decided OK,
maybe it is, it's OK, well then we do hold hands, but the thing is that now those hands
are not casual and thoughtless. They are now
considered and weighed. But we stroll on hand in hand
trying to be just normal and carefree just like everybody else,
but actually we're not! Because we are constantly scanning
the pavement ahead, just in case. And then even if we do see, you know,
a group of blokes coming towards us, maybe we will decide sort of silently
to continue holding hands, defiantly! But now our small, intimate gesture
between two people in love is no longer a small, intimate gesture. It is a political act of defiance,
and it has been ruined. And anyway then you sort of think: ""Well, we've had such a lovely afternoon
poking around in that garden center looking at things for the garden
we don't actually have."" (Laughter) And then you think, all it will take
is one spat ""faggots"" or a split lip to turn that really lovely afternoon
into a bad afternoon that you will never want to remember. And even if you are somewhere
where you think: ""Ah, it's perfectly fine here. Nobody here is going to react badly
to our tiny gesture."" You know, I don't know, say you're
wandering through a posh department store. Even then people will notice. Now, they may only notice
because they're thinking: ""Isn't nice to see two gays
holding hands in public?"" But they still notice, and I don't want them to notice because then our small, intimate,
private, little, human gesture has been turned into a statement,
and I don't want that! Our little, private, gesture,
like Schrödinger's cat, is altered simply by being observed. We live in this sort of homophobic world, and you might think that a small, little thing
like holding hands in public, ""Well, it's just a small thing,""
and you're right! It is indeed just a small thing. But it is one of many small things
that make us human, and there are lots of small things everyday that LGBT people
have to put up with, that other people
don't have to put up with. Lots of small things
that we have to put up with in order to be safe or not to be
the object of ridicule or scorn. And we are expected
to put up with those things and just thank our blessings
that we don't live in a country where we could be imprisoned
or executed for being gay. And we are so used to making
those small adjustments everyday, that even now we rarely ourselves
even notice that we are doing it, because it is just part
of the background of our lives. This constant malign presence
that we have assimilated, and if we complain about it, we are told
we have nothing to complain about because: ""Aren't you lucky
that you don't live in Uganda?"" And yes, I am lucky
that I don't live in Uganda, but that's not good enough! This isn't some sort of game
or competition where the person who has it the worst
wins the right to complain and everybody else has to just
put up or shut up. Our society is homophobic! It is infused with homophobia. It is dripping with homophobia. And when you are forty-five years old and
you have spent thirty years putting up, thirty years absorbing
all of those small slights and intimidations and sneers
and occasionally much worse, you just get tired of it. You get fed up putting up. I am fed up of reading yet another article
by yet another straight person explaining why I am less somehow
than everybody else. You get fed up listening to people
describe you as intrinsically disordered, people who don't even know you,
from their celibate pulpits. You get fed up of the scrawled graffiti, and you get fed up of people
sneeringly describe things as gay. You get fed up of steeling yourself
to pass by the Saturday night drunks hoping that they won't notice you, and you get fed up of people
using their time and energies and talents to campaign against you being treated
just like every other citizen. (Applause) I'm forty-five
and I'm fed up putting up. Now I would, of course, prefer if nobody
harbored any animosity towards gay people or any discomfort with gay relationships, but, you know, I can live with the kind of
small, personal, private homophobia that some people might have. For example,
I can live with Mary in Wicklow who sometimes turns on the television
and sees Graham Norton and thinks, ""Oh, he seems nice enough
but does he have to be so gay?"" (Laughter) I can live with that. I can live with Mary who doesn't
know any gay people, apart from that fella who does her hair
once a month in ""Curl Up and Dye"". (Laughter) Mary, whose only knowledge of gay people
and our relationships comes from what she has gleaned from
schoolyards, church and Coronation Street. I can live with that. I would be happy to sit down on the sofa
and watch Coronation Street with Mary. I would be happy to have a cup of tea
with her and discuss with her why she feels a little uncomfortable
with gay relationships and I would hope that
Mary would change her mind. I would hope that she would
meet more gay people and find out pretty quickly that
we are just as ordinary, just as nice or just as annoying
as all of you people are. And I would hope that
she would change her mind for her own sake
as much as anybody else's, because gay people are just as capable of bringing goodness into Mary's life
as anybody else. And, of course, we could
help her with the decorating! (Laughter) But that kind of personal discomfort
with gay people and their relationships is entirely different from the kind of homophobia
that manifests itself in public. The kind of homophobia that manifests itself in an attempt
to have LGBT people treated differently or less than everybody else. The kind of homophobia that
seeks to characterize gay people and their relationships
as less worthy of respect. That kind of homophobia
I do have a problem with, and I think gay people should be allowed
to call it when they see it, because it is our right to do so! Of course, many people
object to the word homophobia itself. They object to the ""phobia"" part. 'I'm not afraid of you,"" they say. (Laughter) But I'm not saying that homophobes cower in fear every time
they pass a Cher album, (Laughter) but they are afraid. They are afraid of what the world
will look like when it treats gay, lesbian
and bisexual people with the same respect as everybody else. They are afraid that they won't fit
in this brave new world of equality. But, of course, their fear is irrational because, of course, the world
will not look any different. Kids will still want to eat ice cream,
dogs will still play fetch, the tide will still come in, and parallel parking
will still be difficult. (Laughter) The most vocal homophobes
who know that they long ago lost the arguments around
the decriminalization of homosexual sex or every other advance
for gay people since. These days you will find
those very vocal homophobes clustered around
the same-sex marriage debate -- and it is quite the spectacle because, of course, they know that they can't just come right out
and bluntly say what drives them, which is an animus towards gay people, and a disgust at what
they imagine we do in bed, because they know that that won't wash
with the general public anymore. So they are forced to sort of scramble
for any other reason that they can think of
to argue their case. So, gay people are going to destroy
the institution of marriage, gay couples will be wandering through
orphanages picking babies off shelves trying to find one that matches
their new IKEA sofa. (Laughter) Or that allowing gay people to get
married will destroy society itself, and many, many more including
my own personal favorite, which is the old argument that the word
""marriage"" is defined in some dictionary as a union between a man and a woman, and that therefore same-sex marriage
can't possibly be a ""marriage"". Which is a piffling argument against
words and dictionaries and not an argument against
same-sex marriage. (Applause) Now, of course, the other real driver
of homophobia, and you can all clutch your pearls here
because I am going to go here, is a disgust with gay sex,
in particular with gay male sex. The poor old lesbians just get caught
in the homophobic crossfire. (Laughter) You know guilty by association. Because what they really
don't like is anal sex, sodomy, you know, buggery, and they assume that that is all we do. They feverishly imagine that we spend all
day jumping around buggering each other. I mean they obsess on it, and, in fact,
what they actually do, is reduce us down to this one sex act,
whether or not we do it at all, because we are not regular people
with the same hopes and aspirations and ambitions and feelings
as everyone else, we are simply walking sex acts. Earlier this year I was invited
to take part in the St. Pat's for All parade
in Queens, New York. Now it is a really lovely, charming,
grassroots event in Queens which was set up in response to
the ban on gay groups marching in the famous Manhattan
St. Patrick's Day Parade. In that Manhattan St. Patrick's Day Parade
any Irish group who wants can march, Irish policemen can march,
Irish firemen, Irish footballers, Irish community groups,
Irish volleyball teams, Irish book clubs. Any Irish people who want
to have a good shot at being allowed to march
in that parade -- except for Irish gays, because, as far as the organizers
of that parade are concerned, gays are nothing more
than walking sex acts, and there is no place for buggery
in their parade. Now, I actually saw
a small documentary once about one of the leaders of
the organizers of that parade, they are the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and they're like
a Catholic Orange Order (Laughter) -- they dress the same and everything -- (Laughter) and in the documentary, you know,
he was a nice old fellow, and he had this lovely wife,
and they seemed very happy together. And when I looked at them,
I saw this life lived together, and I imagined if I asked him
about their life together, that he would remember
the first time they met, he would remember how nervous he was
on their first date together, and how proud he was when he turned
and saw her coming up the aisle in that dress that she had
fretted over for so long. And I imagine that if I asked him, he would remember that phone call
to say that she had gone into labor and the dash across town, and the other time when she
went so far past her due date that she promised she would bounce up
and down on a trampoline until the baby bounced out of her
and how they laughed so hard about that. And I imagine he would
remember other occasions like when their youngest broke his arm
and cried all the way to the hospital, and that other time when she was sick and
he could not sleep alone in the empty bed and so in the middle of the night he
got up and went back to the hospital even though he knew they wouldn't
let him in to see her at that hour. I imagine that he would remember all
of those things and many more. All of the small things that go up
to making a relationship and making a person a person. And when I looked at him,
I imagined all of those things too. But when he looks at me
he doesn't see me that way. He doesn't see gay people that way. To him we are just sex acts and there
is no place for sex acts in his parade. I am forty-five years old
and I am fed up putting up. So, I'm not anymore. I'm forty-five years old
and I am not putting up anymore because I don't have the energy anymore. Putting up is exhausting! I am forty-five years old
and I'm not putting up anymore because I don't have
the patience anymore. Forty-five years old! I was born
six months before the Stonewall riots, and you have had
forty-five years to work out, that despite appearances, I am just as ordinary,
just as unremarkable, and just as human as you are! I'm forty-five years old
and I am not asking anymore I am just being -- human being! Thank you for your time! (Applause) Thank you! Thank you! (Applause)"
3,The lost art of letter-writing,Lakshmi Pratury,Dec 2007,"Lakshmi Pratury remembers the lost art of letter-writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died. Her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper, too.", (24K),"Transcript (44 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCrnogorskiDeutschEnglishEspañolEsperantoFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیमराठीहिन्दीગુજરાતીภาษาไทยབོད་སྐད་မြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So I thought, ""I will talk about death."" Seemed to be the passion today. Actually, it's not about death. It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about. 00:14So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, ""Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."" And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. 01:03After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore. Handwriting is a disappearing art. I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new? Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. But too late. But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him. 01:51So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. A value for things with a personal touch -- an autographed book, a soul-searching letter. If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. 02:21So what do I plan to leave for my son? I collect autographed books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy. I plan to publish my own notebook. As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son. 02:52I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years. I took it out for the first time to come here. ""Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up. I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."" Thank you."
3,A love story about the power of art as organizing,Aja Monet and phillip agnew,Feb 2019,"In a lyrical talk full of radical imagination, poet Aja Monet and community organizer phillip agnew share the story of how they fell in love and what they've learned about the powerful connection between great social movements and meaningful art. Journey to Smoke Signals Studio in Miami, their home and community art space where they're creating a refuge for neighbors and creators -- and imagining a new answer to distraction, anger and anxiety.", (99K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Aja Monet: Our story begins
like all great, young love stories. 00:05Phillip Agnew: She slid in my DMs ... 00:07AM: He liked about 50 of my photos, back-to-back,
in the middle of the night -- 00:11PA: What I saw was an artist
committed to truth and justice -- and she's beautiful, but I digress. 00:18AM: Our story actually begins
across many worlds, over maqluba and red wine in Palestine. But how did we get there? 00:27PA: Well, I was born in Chicago, the son of a preacher and a teacher. My ears first rung with church songs
sung by my mother on Saturday mornings. My father's South Side
sermons summoned me. My first words
were more notes than quotes. It was music that molded me. Later on, it was Florida A&amp;M University
that first introduced me to organizing. In 2012, a young black male
named Trayvon Martin was murdered, and it changed my life
and millions of others'. We were a ragtag group
of college kids and not-quite adults who had decided enough was enough. Art and organizing became our answer
to anger and anxiety. We built a movement
and it traveled around the world and to Palestine, in 2015. 01:09AM: I was born to a single mother in the Pink House projects
of Brooklyn, New York. Maddened by survival, I gravitated inwards towards books, poems
and my brother's hand-me-down Walkman. I saw train-station theater, subwoofing streets and hood murals. In high school, I found a community
of metaphor magicians and truth-telling poets in an organization called Urban Word NYC. Adopted by the Black Arts movement, I won the legendary
Nuyorican Poets Cafe Grand Slam title. 01:40(Applause and cheers) 01:42At Sarah Lawrence College,
I worked with artists to respond to Hurricane Katrina
and the earthquake; I discovered the impact of poetry and the ability to not just
articulate our feelings, but to get us to work
towards changing things and doing something about it, when a friend, Maytha Alhassen,
invited me to Palestine ... 02:02PA: We were a delegation
of artists and organizers, and we immersed ourselves
in Palestinian culture, music, their stories. Late into the night, we would have discussions
about the role of art in politics and the role of politics in art. Aja and I disagree. 02:18AM: Oh, we disagree. 02:19PA: But we quite quickly
and unsurprisingly fell in love. Exhibit A: me working my magic. 02:26(Laughter) 02:28AM: Obvious, isn't it? Four months later, this artist -- 02:33PA: and this organizer -- 02:35AM: moved into a little home
with a big backyard, in Miami. 02:42PA: (Sighs) Listen, five months
before this ever happened, I predicted it all. I'm going to tell you -- a friend sat me down and said, ""You've done so much for organizing, when are you going to settle down?"" I looked him straight in the face and I said, ""The only way
that it would ever happen is if it is a collision. This woman would have to knock me
completely off course."" I didn't know how right I was. 03:04(Laughter) 03:05Our first few months
were like any between young lovers: filled with hot, passionate, all-night ... 03:12AM: nonstop ... 03:14PA: discussions. 03:15(Laughter) 03:16PA: Aja challenged everything
I knew and understood about the world. She forced me -- 03:21AM: lovingly -- 03:22PA: to see our organizing
work with new eyes. She helped me see the unseen things and how artists illuminate
our interior worlds. 03:29AM: There were many days
I did not want to get up out of bed and face the exterior world. I was discouraged. There was so much loss and death and artists were being used
to numb, lull and exploit. While winning awards, accolades
and grants soothed so many egos, people were still dying and I was seeking community. Meeting Phillip brought so much joy,
love, truth into my life, and it pulled me out of isolation. He showed me that community
and relationships wasn't just about building
great movements. It was integral in creating
powerful, meaningful art, and neither could be done in solitude. 04:14PA: Yeah, we realized many of our artist
and organizer friends were also lost in these cycles of sadness, and we were in movements
that often found themselves at funerals. We asked ourselves what becomes of a generation
all too familiar with the untimely ends of lives
streamed daily on our Timelines? It was during one
of our late-night discussions that we saw beyond art and organizing and began to see that art was organizing. 04:40AM: The idea was set: art was an anchor,
not an accessory to movement. Our home was a home
of radical imagination; an instrument of our nurturing hearts; a place of risk where were dared
to laugh, love, cry, debate. Art, books, records and all this stuff
decorated our walls, and there was lizards -- walls of palm trees that guided
our guests into our backyard, where our neighbors would come
and feel right at home. The wind -- the wind was an affirmation
for the people who walked into the space. And we learned that in a world -- a bewildering world
of so much distraction -- we were able to cultivate a space
where people could come and be present, and artists and organizers
could find refuge. 05:32PA: This became Smoke Signals Studio. 05:35AM: As we struggle to clothe, house,
feed and educate our communities; our spirits hunger for connection,
joy and purpose; and as our bodies
are out on the front lines, our souls still need to be fed, or else we succumb
to despair and depression. Our art possesses rhythmic communication, coded emotional cues, improvised feelings of critical thought. Our social movements should be like jazz: encouraging active participation, listening, spontaneity and freedom. What people see as a party ... 06:14PA: is actually a movement meeting. See, we aren't all protest and pain. Here's a place to be loved, to be felt, to be heard, and where we prepare
for the most pressing political issues in our neighborhoods. See, laws never change culture, but culture always changes laws. Art -- 06:36(Applause) 06:38footnotefootnoteArt as organizing is even changing
and opening doors in places seen as the opposite of freedom. Our weekly poetry series is transforming the lives of men
incarcerated at Dade Correctional, and we're so excited to bring you all
the published work of one of those men, Echo Martinez. In the intro, he says ... 06:55AM: ""Poetry for the people
is a sick pen's penicillin. It's a cuff key to a prisoner's dreams. The Molotov in the ink. It is knowledge, it is overstanding, it is tasting ingredients
in everything you've been force-fed, but most of all, it's a reminder
that we all have voices, we all can be heard
even if we have to scream."" 07:14In 2018, we created our first annual
Maroon Poetry Festival at the TACOLCY Center in Liberty City. There, the Last Poets,
Sonia Sanchez, Emory Douglas and the late, great Ntozake Shange, performed and met
with local artists and organizers. We were able to honor them for their commitment
to radical truth-telling. And in addition to that, we transformed a public park into the physical manifestation
of the world we are organizing for. Everything that we put into poetry, we put into the art, into the creativity, into the curated kids' games and into the stunning stage design. 07:57PA: Our work is in a long line
of cultural organizers that understood to use art
to animate a radical future. Artists like June Jordan, Emory Douglas and Nina Simone. They understood what many of us
are just now realizing -- that to get people to build the ship, you've got to get
them to long for the sea; that data rarely moves people,
but great art always does. This understanding -- 08:21(Applause) 08:24footnotefootnoteThis understanding informed the thinking behind the Dream Defenders'
""Freedom Papers,"" a radical political vision
for the future of Florida that talked about people over profits. Now, we could have done a policy paper. Instead, artists and organizers
came together in their poetry to create incredible murals and did the video that we see behind us. We joined the political precision
of the Black Panther Party and the beautiful poetry
of Puerto Rican poet Martín Espada to bring our political vision to life. 08:55AM: Now thousands of Floridians
across age, race, gender and class see the ""Freedom Papers""
as a vision for the future of their lives. For decades, our artists and our art
has been used to exploit, lull, numb, sell things to us and to displace our communities, but we believe
that the personal is political and the heart is measured by what is done, not what one feels. And so art as organizing is not
just concerned with artists' intentions, but their actual impact. Great art is not a monologue. Great art is a dialogue
between the artist and the people. 09:41PA: Four years ago, this artist ... 09:44AM: and this organizer ... 09:46PA: found that we were not just a match. 09:49AM: We were a mirror. 09:50PA: Our worlds truly did collide, and in many ways ... 09:54AM: they combined. 09:56PA: We learned so much about movement, about love and about art
at its most impactful: when it articulates the impossible
and when it erodes individualism, when it plays into the gray places
of our black and white worlds, when it does what our democracy does not, when it reminds us
that we are not islands, when it adorns every street
but Wall Street and Madison Avenue, when it reminds us that we are not islands and refuses to succumb to the numbness, when it indicts empire and inspires each
and every one of us to love, tell the truth and make revolution irresistible. 10:34AM: For the wizards -- 10:35(Applause) 10:39AM: For the wizards
and ways of our defiance, love-riot visions of our rising,
risen, raised selves. 10:49The overcoming grace -- fires, bitter tongues, wise as rickety rocking chairs, suffering salt and sand skies. 10:58Memories unshackled and shining stitches on a stretch-marked heart. 11:04For the flowers that bloom
in midnight scars. How we suffered and sought a North Star. When there was no light, we glowed. We sparked this rejoice, this righteous delight. We have a cause to take joy in. How we weathered and persisted, tenacious, no stone unturned. How we witnessed the horror of mankind and did not become
that which horrified us. 11:35PA: Thank you. 11:36AM: Thank you. 11:37(Applause)"

princess of Tara, and bride-to-be, was furious. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, leader of the Fianna, Ireland’s most celebrated band 
of warriors, had just arrived at her castle. Gráinne had believed she was betrothed
to a young soldier, bold and brilliant enough to be her equal. Yet upon their arrival, it became clear
she was expected to marry Fionn himself; who, while once a legend, 
was far past his prime. Gráinne would not suffer this insult. 00:40Before the wedding,
the King held a great banquet. As the warriors told tales of Fionn’s
strength and magical healing hands, Gráinne waited to enact her revenge. But while scanning the room, her eyes
locked on to one of the guests. Diarmuid, one of Fionn’s bravest soldiers and foster child 
of the God of Love himself, was renowned for his stunning beauty. Perhaps this was the bold warrior
the princess had imagined? Only one way to find out. 01:10Gráinne swept into action, slipping a sleeping draught 
into the partygoers’ goblets. Soon the hall fell silent—
save for two unenchanted guests. The pair immediately felt a powerful
connection. But Diarmuid hesitated. He’d never put his interests
before the Fianna’s. Seeing Diarmuid waver 
between duty and desire, Gráinne took the decision 
out of his hands. With a light kiss, 
she placed a geas on his brow— an ancient spell that bound them together,
for better or worse. 01:46As the pair escaped,
Diarmuid’s heart was racing. Had he really betrayed Fionn 
for a woman he’d just met? To answer his son’s questions, 
Angus Óg appeared beside them. The God of Love blessed their union
and eased his son’s concern. But he also warned that endless
difficulties lay ahead. 02:07At the palace, Fionn awoke full of wrath. He rallied an epic war band that quickly
caught up to the lovers. To buy time, Diarmuid and Gráinne conjured
a massive enclosure with seven doors. While Gráinne escaped with Angus Óg,
Diarmuid went door to door seeking Fionn. Some of the Fianna sought peaceful
surrender, others itched for combat. Diarmuid gave neither. But when he finally heard his leader’s 
voice calling for blood, he knew there was no turning back. Launching himself over the barricade,
Diarmuid leapt to Gráinne’s side. The chase was on. 02:45The pair ventured west, where they soon 
encountered the giant Modan. Eager to help the lovers, he guarded 
them at night and carried them by day. And once the pair had crossed
countless rivers and hills, their fear began to ease. They left the forest’s cover, laughing, 
flirting, and growing bolder each day. 03:04But Fionn saw their contentment
was an opportunity. He enlisted three sea chiefs 
to capture the wandering lovers. Diarmuid scared them 
off with mystifying sword tricks— only for Fionn to send poisonous hounds. Diarmuid and Gráinne fled yet again 
into an even more tangled forest— a sight which filled the Fianna
with exhaustion. They implored Fionn to give up the hunt,
and at this, their leader grew quiet. He’d already lost a dear friend— now it seemed his wrath had cost him
the respect of his men as well. Swallowing his rage, 
he called off the chase. 03:45For years, Gráinne and Diarmuid
lived in peace. In time, Angus Óg even brokered 
an agreement between the warriors, and their conflict faded into memory. But Gráinne never forgot 
the love god’s warning. 04:00One day, Fionn invited Diarmuid 
on a boar hunt high in the mountains. While the two were riding,
a venomous boar charged them and mortally wounded Diarmuid. As he bled, the old warrior begged 
his friend for water, as all the Fianna knew drinking 
from the hands of Fionn Mac Cumhaill could save their lives. But as Fionn turned to aid Diarmuid,
his old resentments came rushing back. For just a moment, his fingers parted,
letting the water trickle to the ground. And by the time Fionn realized 
his mistake, it was too late. And the embers of rage that long burned
inside him were finally quenched by tears."

before we dive into talking about sex. (Laughter) Just one big, slow, deep breath in. (Inhales) And a big, slow, deep breath out. (Exhales) OK, now let's talk about sex. So yes, my name is Emily.
I am a sex educator. It's the best job in the world. In the fall of 2010, I taught a class called
""Women's Sexuality"" at Smith College. It was a 100-level,
introductory-level class, but I shoehorned in
all the science I could, all the psychophysiology and all the neuroscience and even - God forbid - all the sociology, and at the end of this really
intense semester, I asked my students to write down just one really important thing
that they had learned. This is what they said: ""I'm normal."" ""I am normal."" ""Just because my sexuality
is not the same as other women's, that does not make me abnormal."" ""Everything is normal.
Bringing joy and confidence to sex."" ""I learned that everything is normal, making it possible for me to go
through the rest of my life with confidence and joy."" 187 students I had in that class, and more than half of them
wrote something along the lines of ... ""I'm normal."" So I sat in my office, and I read those responses
with tears in my eyes. There was something essential
to my students about feeling normal, and somehow my class had unlocked
the door to that feeling. Moments like that are why
I'm a sex educator; it's why I'm here. I mean, it's why I'm here in Nevada, but it's why I'm here: to give everyone on Earth an experience like the one
my students had, of unlocking the door
to their own authentic sexual well-being. So that's what I'm going to do
with you guys today. (Laughter) Because it turns out,
we all really are ... normal. The science says so. I can prove it! Are you ready? Let's do it! OK!
(Inhales deeply) The mechanism in your brain
that controls sexual response is the ""dual control model."" The dual control model -
that means there's how many parts? Two! Thank you! And if I tell you the first part is
the sexual accelerator or the ""gas pedal,"" that means the second part
has to be the ... ? Brake! They don't let just anybody
into these TED Talks. (Laughter) So, the sexual accelerator notices all the sexually-relevant
information in the environment, everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine, that your brain codes
as sexually relevant, and it sends the signal
that says ""Turn on."" And it is functioning at a low level
all the time, including right now, just the fact that we're talking about sex
is a little bit sexually relevant. At the same time that
that's happening, in parallel, your brake is noticing all the very good
reasons not to be turned on right now. This is everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine that your brain codes
as a potential threat. And it sends a signal
that says ""Turn off."" So the process of becoming aroused is the dual process of turning on the ons and turning off the offs. Usually when people struggle with
their sexual well-being, it's because - sometimes there's not enough
stimulation to the gas pedal, but more often, it's because
there's too much stimulation to the brake, and all kinds of things can hit the brake. Like: Are you worried
about unwanted pregnancy? Are you worried about your kids
walking in, in the middle? Are you really sure that your partner
loves your sexy body? Are you really sure
that you love your sexy body? Did you spend the first
two decades of your life in a culture that taught you that sex
is dangerous, disgusting and dirty? That's going to hit the brake, right? (Laughter) So the first thing science tells us to do when we're struggling
with our sexual functioning, when we want to access
our own authentic sexual well-being, is to start to think through: What are things that hit our accelerator?
What are the things that hit our brake? And especially, what are some strategies that we can use in order to minimise the things
that are hitting the brake? I'm going to talk about two
such evidence-based strategies at the end of the talk. But before I do that, I need to come clean
with you about something, which is that all that stuff I just said isn't anywhere near as simple
as I made it sound. Sorry. To explain what I mean, I'll tell you about
the only affective neuroscience that has ever made me laugh out loud. OK. So I need you to imagine
that you're a lab rat. You're a very savvy, experienced lab rat and the researchers have inserted a probe
into your nucleus accumbens, a little, sort of jellybean-shaped thing
in the middle of your emotional brain. It's a painless procedure,
the researchers are clear to say. Plink! So you're this sort of
semi-remote-controlled bionic rat, and you're in a three-chambered box, here you are in box #1 -
just the ordinary lab environment - there's a bit of noise, the lights are on,
but it's fine, you're good at this. So when the researchers
zap the front of your nucleus accumbens, here's what you do: Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh! So these are approach, moving toward,
curious behaviors, right? Ooh! What's that? And then, in this ordinary
lab environment - the first box - when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens, you do this: aaah, what the hell is that!? You're kicking up dust
in the face of the predator. These are stress, avoidance,
dread responses, right? Moving away as opposed to moving towards. Hit the front? Ooh..! What's that?
Hit the back? What the hell is that!? Got that?
(Laughter) That's box #1. So we move into box #2. Now box #2 is silent, and it's dark, and it smells like your mother. (Laughter) It is ... I call it the ""Rat Spa."" It's the most peaceful, calm state of mind
you can imagine being in, and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens, What do you do? Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh! And then, when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens, What do they do? Ooh, ooh! What's that? When you're in a calm, relaxed,
peaceful state of mind, your brain will interpret
almost any sensation as something that should be
approached with curiosity. Even stimulation
that in a different context, it might interpret as a potential threat
to be moved away from. But wait ... There's more! (Laughter) We move to box #3. So, here in box #3,
the lights are on really bright, music's played at different volumes,
you can't even get used to it, they specify in the research paper - this made me laugh out loud - they specify they're playing Iggy Pop. So ...
(Laughter) Imagine ""Lust for Life"" is playing
at lots of different volumes, you can't get used to it, you're an introverted bookworm
in the worst nightclub in the world, and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens, What do you do? Aah..! What the hell is that!? Exactly! They don't let just anybody 
into these talks, that's amazing! So, when you are in a stressed-out, 
threatened state of mind, your brain will interpret almost
any sensation as something to be avoided, as a potential threat - even stimulation
that in a different context, it might've interpreted as something
to be approached with curiosity. All of which is a really nerdy way of describing a thing all
of us have experienced in the form of tickling. (Laughter) Because, you know,
tickling is not everyone's favorite, that's fair, I understand, but at least hypothetically,
you can imagine a world where you're in a sexy, fun,
flirty state of mind already, and your certain special someone
starts tickling on you, and it can feel fun and playful and
potentially lead to further nooky, right? But if that exact same
certain special someone tried to tickle when you were
pissed off at them, (Laughter) how would that feel? As one of my students recently put it:
""Violence would shortly ensue."" (Laughter) But the weird thing is,
it's exactly the same sensation, but because the context is different, your brain interprets it
entirely the opposite way. So when I say, ""Turn on the ons,
and turn off the offs,"" it's nowhere near as simple as just
""Touch me here - don't touch me that way."" What it means is, create a context
that allows your brain to interpret the world
as a pleasurable, safe, sexy place. For most people - again, people vary - 
but for most people, that context is low stress,
high affection and high trust. Those three things are hard enough
to come by in the 21st century, but they are not actually the keys that unlock that door
to your authentic sexual well-being. Sorry! But this is the big moment, right? This is when I - here they are. I've got this satin
shiny pillow with tassels and two keys lying on it. Right here: the keys to your 
authentic sexual well-being. Don't you want to know what they are? I will explain. The first key says ""confidence,""
and the second key says ""joy."" How do they work? What do you mean? 
Where do I get them? Confidence - Confidence comes from knowing 
what is true about your body, your sexuality, your internal experience. Knowing what's true. Knowing that you have a brake,
for example, as well as an accelerator. Knowing that they're sensitive to context, knowing what's true even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true, even if it's not what you
were taught ""should"" be true. Confidence is knowing what is true. Joy ... is loving what's true. Loving your brake
as much as your accelerator, loving that they're sensitive to context, loving what's true even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true, even - especially - if it's not
what you were taught ""should"" be true. And I guarantee you, you're going to walk out of here
with both keys in your pocket. I'm going to tell you specifically
how to get your hands on them. But first, I need to talk to you
about a cartoon panda. (Laughter) Have you seen the movie ""Kung-fu Panda""? It's about a cartoon panda named Po; he becomes a kung-fu master -
""Kung Fu Panda"" - by diligent effort,
the support of his teacher and the wisdom of the Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Scroll contains the key
to limitless power! And when Po first gets his hands 
on the Dragon Scroll he is ... disappointed because there's nothing written on it. It's blank. It just reflects his face. And then comes his epiphany: There is no secret ingredient. It's just ... you. And that is how
you get your hands on the keys that unlock the door
to your own authentic sexual well-being, by turning toward your own 
internal experience with calm curiosity. Ooh! What's that? Because it turns out
the key to limitless power is you. And now I will tell you the two concrete, specific,
evidence-based things that you can do in order to increase your grasp 
on these two keys of confidence and joy. Ready? Thing #1: What I want you to do is stand in front of a mirror
as close to naked as you can tolerate. (Laughter) It gets worse! (Laughter) So what you're going to do
is look at what you see there, and you're going to write down
everything that you see that you like. 12:45Of course, first your brain will flood
with culturally-constructed messages about how your body falls short
of the culturally-constructed ideal - that's fine, you have every other minute of the day
to have those self-critical thoughts, just set them aside, temporarily. 
 Right now, you will write down
the things you see that you like. If it is your eyelashes, write that down. If it's your toenails, write that down. And then do it again tomorrow. And then do it again the next day, and the next day, and the more often you do it, the more obvious it will become to you what a frickin' frackin'
miracle your body is, and the more immune you'll become to all the cultural, noisy crap
that's hitting the brakes. Option #2: If you genuinely
cannot imagine looking in a mirror and seeing anything there
that you would like, here's what I want you to do instead. I want you to get into a calm,
quiet state of mind, just for a couple of minutes each day, and I want you to visualize that door, that door that stands between you
and your authentic sexual well-being. And what I want you to do 
when you can see it really clearly, is that I want you to shine a beacon 
of kindness and compassion on the door. Because here's the thing about the door:
It's not innate, you weren't born with it. It was constructed in your brain by
your life experience and by your culture, and you may hate the culture
that built that door, you may work to change 
the culture that built that door, but never turn toward 
the door itself with hate, because the door is part of you too. And it is not random, 
it's there to do some work. If you've been shamed
for what's on the other side of that door, if you have been shamed
for your sexuality - and who hasn't? - that door is there trying to protect you 
from social isolation and judgement. If you have had what's behind that door - if you had your own sexuality
used against you as a weapon, if you're a survivor of sexual violence, your door is there doing
really important work. I'm talking here about one in four - you've heard these statistics already - one in four women in America,
one in six men ... One in four women in this room, one in six men. And two thirds of transgender folks. If that's you, your door is doing 
the hard work of helping you to survive in a world where your own sexuality 
can be used against you as a weapon, and it is working! You know how I can tell? Here you are! Surviving. And I am so grateful to your door 
for doing that really important work, and I don't know if your door
might be ready to open a little bit or if your door needs
to stay closed a little while longer, but I know that the first step is always to turn toward the door 
with kindness and compassion. Confidence is knowing what's true about you, your sexuality,
your internal experience. Joy is loving what's true even when it's not what you
were taught ""should"" be true. I'm a sex educator. It's the best job in the world! (Laughter) I teach people to live with confidence 
and joy inside their bodies, but really all that means is I offer them the science
that helps them find the way back to themselves. Because it turns out we all really are ... Oh, who am I kidding?
We're not just normal! We, the human species, we're amazing! We - all of us - are beguiling,
we are courageous, God knows we are delectable, we are all the way down the alphabet
to ""yopping"" and ""zesty."" (Laughter) Your body - (Cheering) (Applause) It's you guys! Your body is perfect. 
Exactly the way it is. The science says so. And now you can prove it! Thank you very much. (Cheering) (Applause)"

And when I met him, I was in awe of witnessing this tiny,
beautiful being enter into our lives. I also had this realization
that he wasn't just entering our lives, he was entering the world -- this crazy world that, especially now,
feels so incredibly challenging. I spend a lot time in my work
talking to people about who we are, who we must be and what our healing looks like. 00:36So the first time I held him, I had my pep talk ready. You know, I wanted him to know
that the way we find our strength is through our challenges. I wanted him to know
that we can all do something big when we start small. I wanted him to know
that each of us is more resilient than we could ever imagine. So here I am holding little Thelonious. I look down at him, and it hits me: he's a baby. 01:05(Laughter) 01:06He's not going to understand
a single word I say to him. So instead, I thought
it would probably be a better idea if I went home and wrote. So, this is for grownups, but it's also for Thelonious, when he's old enough to read it: 01:24footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""Be a better person."" Do not be afraid to say, ""Yes."" Start by being a better listener. Start by being better
at walking down the street. See people. Say, ""Hello."" Ask how they are doing
and listen to what they say. Start by being a better friend, a better parent,
a better child to your parents; a better sibling, a better lover,
a better partner. Start by being a better neighbor. Meet someone you do not know,
and get to know them. 02:03The world will say to you, ""What are you going to do?"" Do not be afraid to say, ""I know I can't do everything, but I can do something."" Walk into more rooms saying, ""I'm here to help."" Become intimate with generosity. Give what you can give,
and do what you can do. Give dollars, give cents, give your time, give your love, give your heart, give your spirit. 02:33The world will say to you, ""We need peace."" Find your peace within, hold it sacred, bring it with you everywhere you go. Peace cannot be shared
or created with others if we cannot first generate it within. 02:54The world will say to you, ""They are the enemy."" Love enough to know that just because someone
disagrees with you, it does not make them your enemy. You may not win an argument, you may not change a mind, but if you choose to, you can always achieve
the triumph of radical empathy -- an understanding of the heart. 03:19footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""We need justice."" Investigate. Find truth beyond
the stories you are told. Find truth beyond the way things seem. Ask, ""Why?"" Ask, ""Is this fair?"" Ask, ""How did we get here?"" Do this with compassion. Do this with forgiveness. Learn to forgive others. Start by truly learning
how to forgive yourself. We are all more than our mistakes. We are all more
than who we were yesterday. We are all deserving of our dignity. See yourself in others. Recognize that your justice is my justice, and mine is yours. There can be no liberation for one of us
if the other is not free. 04:13(Applause) 04:16The world will say to you, ""I am violent."" Respond by saying, ""I am not. Not with my words
and not with my actions."" 04:29The world will say to you, ""We need to heal the planet."" Start by saying, ""No, thank you.
I don't need a plastic bag."" Recycle, reuse. Start by picking up
one piece of trash on your block. 04:43footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""There are too many problems."" Do not be afraid
to be a part of the solutions. Start by discussing the issues. We cannot overcome what we ignore. The more we talk about things, the more we see
that the issues are connected because we are connected. 05:06The world will say to you, ""We need to end racism."" Start by healing it in your own family. 05:14The world will say to you, ""How do we speak to bias and bigotry?"" Start by having the first conversation
at your own kitchen table. 05:24The world will say to you, ""There is so much hate."" Devote yourself to love. Love yourself so much
that you can love others without barriers and without judgment. When the world asks us big questions
that require big answers, we have two options. One: to feel so overwhelmed
or unqualified, we do nothing. Two: to start with one small act
and qualify ourselves. I am the director of national security, and so are you. Maybe no one appointed us
and there were no senate confirmations, but we can secure a nation. When you help just one person
to be more secure, a nation is more secure. With just one outstretched hand
that says, ""Are you OK? I am here for you,"" we can transform insecurity into security. 06:24We find ourselves saying to the world, ""What should I do?""
""What should we do?"" The better question might be: ""How am I showing up?"" I ask the world for peace, but do I show up with peace
when I see my family and friends? I ask the world to end hatred, but do I show up with love
not only for those I know, but those I don't know? Do I show up with love for those
whose ideas conflict with my own? I ask the world to end suffering, but do I show up for those
who are suffering on my street corner? We say to the world, ""Please change; we need change."" But how do we show up
to change our own lives? How do we show up to change the lives
of the people in our communities? 07:12James Baldwin said, ""Everything now,
we must assume is in our own hands; we have no right to assume otherwise."" This has always been true. 07:23footnotefootnoteNo one nominated
Harriet Tubman to her purpose, to her mission, to her courage. She did not say, ""I'm not a congressman or the president of the United States, so how could I possibly participate
in the fight to abolish a system as big as slavery?"" She instead spent 10 years
making 19 trips, freeing 300 people, one group of people at a time. Think about the children
of those 300 people, the grandchildren,
the great-grandchildren and beyond. Our righteous acts create
immeasurable ripples in the endless river of justice. 08:03Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey,
Irma or Maria, people did not say, ""There is so much damage.
What should I do?"" They got to work on what they could do. Those with boats got in their boats and started loading in every woman,
man and child they came across. Near and far, people gave their dollars, they gave their cents, they gave their hearts, they gave their spirit. 08:29We spend so much time thinking we don't have
the power to change the world. We forget that the power to change
someone's life is always in our hands. Change-making does not belong
to one group of people; it belongs to all of us. You don't have to wait
on anyone to tell you that you are in this. Begin. Start by doing what you can
with what you've got, where you are and in your own way. 09:03footnotefootnoteWe don't have to be heroes, wear a uniform, call ourselves activists or get elected to participate. We just have to be brave enough to care. 09:16Now, around the time Thelonious was born, I went to the birthday party
of a man named Gene Moretti. It was his 100th birthday, which means he lived in the United States
through the Depression, World War II, the struggle for workers' rights, the achievement
of a woman's right to vote, the Civil Rights Movement, a man on the moon, the Vietnam War and the election
of the first black president. I sat with him, and I said, ""Gene, you have lived
in America for 100 years. Do you have any advice
during these current times?"" He smiled and said to me simply, ""Yes. Be good to as many people as possible."" And as he danced with my mother, who is, by the way, half his age, in a room full of generations
of his family and hundreds of people, many of whom traveled thousands of miles
to be there to celebrate him, I realized that he had not
just given me advice, he had given me the first step that every single one of us
is capable of making if we want to create
a real, wholehearted impact on the world around us, right now. 10:33""Be good to as many people as possible."" 10:38Thank you. 10:39(Applause)"

What's the solution? Whether you're looking to reignite the spark in your relationship or reconnect with your own desire, Kerner shares advice on how to cultivate your erotic imagination and get back on the ""arousal runway."" (Note: This talk contains mature content. In order to protect patient privacy, the speaker has combined or adj...", (12K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)FootnotesFootnotes00:00So having a sex problem
is like having a toothache. By the time you get to the dentist,
or to me, a sex therapist, you just want to get out of pain. But what we just went through with COVID,
that was like a sexual root canal. I mean, we spent months
not changing out of our pajamas. And sometimes not showering. No wonder so many of us lost our libidos. It's not that we're not sexual people. We want to want sex. We just don't want it. 00:34footnotefootnoteIn my work with couples, one of the biggest problems I see is that sex often stalls out
before it even gets started. There’s a “failure to launch,” an inability to get going
and gain momentum. For example, one of my patients shuts down as soon as her partner starts to kiss her. Turns out, her boyfriend
in the eighth grade told her she had bad breath. Another patient of mine
is terrified of losing his erection, so much so that he avoids any situation
that could possibly lead to sex. But he tells his partner he has no desire, and he blames it on work stress. Meanwhile, he's filled with longing. He just doesn't dare show it. And so his partner
feels confused and unattractive. 01:29For some of us, there just
isn't room in our busy lives for sexual energy to emerge. There isn’t what I call the “erotic
thread” between sexual events, those moments when
we can express desire or feel desire, pivot in and out of a quick sexual charge
just for the heck of it. So, you know, it's no surprise that by the time we actually
do get around to finally having sex, too often it can feel reduced to a mundane series
of predictable behaviors, stale and drained of erotic life. So why even bother? 02:09Whenever the issue is a failure to launch, what we really need is a new way in, what I call an arousal runway. And I firmly believe that that runway needs to be in the form
of psychological arousal, not just physical. For example, we know that some women
can fantasize their way to orgasm without ever touching themselves. And men -- well, men
can just look at something sexy or think about something sexy and start to get
a strong physical reaction. That's the power of psychological arousal. So why aren't we sharing
more of it with each other? 02:50Well, in the beginning of a relationship,
we really don't need to. The newness itself is often
its own form of psychological stimuli. But as we go on, and as our sexual connection
starts to lose its vitality, that's when we need to be more deliberate
about engaging our erotic minds together. Otherwise, we might start to drift apart. We might start to fall
into a sexless relationship. Some of us might even start to cheat, which is the only way that many of us know
to get back on that arousal runway. 03:29I have rarely met a couple that doesn't understand
the importance of psychological arousal and doesn't want
more of it in the bedroom, but they often just
don't know where to begin. So I give homework assignments that emphasize two types
of psychological arousal: face to face and side by side. Face to face is things
like sharing a fantasy, role-playing a sexy scenario, engaging in sexual role-play. Activities that two people can do
just between themselves with only their imaginations. Well, that's easier said than done. With so much shame
and inhibition around sex that takes willingness, it takes vulnerability,
and it takes courage. So I often suggest starting out
with a side by side experience, something that's a little less pressured. Reading some literary erotica
aloud together, listening to a sexy podcast,
watching ethical porn. That's the kind where the performers
actually want to be there. 04:41Recently, I was working
with a heterosexual couple that needed an arousal boost. They were trying to get back into sex
after having a baby. And she especially needed help
tuning out the stressors and getting into a sexual mindset. But as a breastfeeding mom,
she felt totally touched out. So she loved the idea
of psychological arousal. She thought it would be a blast
to watch porn together. She never did anything
like that in her life. But for him, that was
something private and off limits, and he was worried that she was going
to judge him based on his tastes. So I came up with a solution. I gave them a list of ethical porn sites, and I asked them, ""Hey, how do you feel about each picking a scene or two
that you think would turn on the other?"" Well, not only was he willing to do that, it led to a fascinating and funny
follow-up conversation. He asked her, ""Why exactly
did you pick tickle torture for me?"" 05:47(Laughter) 05:48So starting side by side, it helps us get face to face. But then that face to face arousal, it needs to be more
than just putting on sexy lingerie or buying handcuffs and a blindfold. On their own, those things
are pretty inert. What makes them arousing is when they
enable us to tap into our fantasies, or what the late great sex therapist
Jack Morin called a “core erotic theme.” Sexual scenarios that uniquely
turn us on more than others, and they hold on
to that erotic charge over time. 06:31footnotefootnoteWell, a lot of couples say
they don't have fantasies or they don't know
what their fantasies are. But once you start having
those side by side experiences, those erotic themes start to emerge
and get talked about. Like the couple with the new baby. Why did she end up
picking tickle torture for him? Well, she felt like
he needed to lose control, both in and out of the bedroom, and he was very ticklish. Because she was the one who actually
had to go through the pain of childbirth, but then he made such a big deal
about being in the delivery room and having to watch and how hard it was, he needed to be punished for that. 07:15(Laughter) 07:16And because she loved the idea of just
stepping out of her nurturing mom role and for a little while
being a powerful dominatrix. I can't say they ever got as far
as actually engaging in tickle torture, but I do know that they started to move
from side by side to face to face and started to play with power
in ways that they both found really hot. 07:41So what if you are someone
who fantasizes during sex but you keep it to yourself? Does that count a psychological arousal? And what if the person
you're fantasizing about isn't the person
you're actually having sex with? That can be confusing. You might start to wonder,
""What's going on here? Am I bored? Am I not into the sex?
Am I cheating in my mind? Should I push those thoughts
out of my head?"" No. Our fantasies are our allies. They help distract us away from the chaotic world
outside of our bedroom, and they lead us and they lull us
into our sexual bodies so that we can tune in and turn on. Our fantasies are our friends. You don't fear them. You follow them. 08:44Now does that mean you should
take your partner with you and tell them about that secret fantasy? Well, that depends. It could be a great way of going deeper
into that face-to-face arousal. But on the other hand, if you and your partner
are just starting to dip your toes into the shallow end of the fantasy pool, well, then you might want to hang out in the intermediate section
a little bit, you know, like splash around a little bit,
get comfortable, develop some emotional safety, establish boundaries. I mean, maybe you got
to make it clear to your partner, ""Hey, just so we know, fantasy is fantasy
because it's not reality, right?"" There's a line between thought and action. And just because you happen to have
erotic themes that turn you on and that include others, that doesn't mean that the sex
isn't still just about the two of you. 09:44A bunch of years ago, I did a study with Dr Kristen Mark
on the topic of sexual boredom. We surveyed nearly 3,500 people
in committed relationships and found that more than 50 percent were
either bored or on the brink of boredom. Women were twice as likely to be bored
in the first year of a relationship, and men got bored
in the first three years. That's a whole lot of boredom
on both sides of the bed. But the good news, the vast majority of respondents
were entirely interested in trying something new
that their partners suggested. So the antidote to boredom,
it could just be a sexy suggestion away. It could be as simple
as waking up one morning, looking at your partner and just saying, ""Hey, I just had
the hottest dream about you."" And then you fill in the blanks. If it makes you blush,
just blame it on your subconscious. The point is that sexy suggestion, that little nugget
of psychological arousal, that could be the difference
between lying in bed next to someone and feeling a million miles apart, or getting on that arousal runway
together and taking off. 11:12So what do you think? After a year and a half of being grounded, Isn't it time to spread our sexual wings
and let ourselves fly? 11:25Thank you."
1,Technology hasn't changed love. Here's why,Helen Fisher,Sep 2016,"In our tech-driven, interconnected world, we've developed new ways and rules to court each other, but the fundamental principles of love have stayed the same, says anthropologist Helen Fisher.

in the Highlands of New Guinea, and I was talking with a man
who had three wives. I asked him, ""How many wives
would you like to have?"" And there was this long pause, and I thought to myself, ""Is he going to say five? Is he going to say 10? Is he going to say 25?"" And he leaned towards me and he whispered, ""None."" 00:20(Laughter) 00:23Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives: polygyny. But in the vast majority
of these cultures, only about five or ten percent of men
actually do have several wives. Having several partners
can be a toothache. In fact, co-wives can
fight with each other, sometimes they can even poison
each other's children. And you've got to have
a lot of cows, a lot of goats, a lot of money, a lot of land, in order to build a harem. 00:51footnotefootnoteWe are a pair-bonding species. Ninety-seven percent of mammals
do not pair up to rear their young; human beings do. I'm not suggesting that we're not -- that we're necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners. I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures, I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it, and some of the brain circuitry of it. It's very common around the world, but we are built to love. 01:15footnotefootnoteHow is technology changing love? I'm going to say almost not at all. I study the brain. I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner -- people who had just
fallen happily in love, people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long-term. And it is possible
to remain ""in love"" long-term. And I've long ago maintained that we've evolved three distinctly
different brain systems for mating and reproduction: sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner. And together, these three brain systems -- with many other parts of the brain -- orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives. 02:02But they lie way below the cortex, way below the limbic system
where we feel our emotions, generate our emotions. They lie in the most primitive parts
of the brain, linked with energy, focus, craving, motivation,
wanting and drive. In this case, the drive to win life's greatest prize: a mating partner. They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors, and they're not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder. 02:34(Laughter) 02:36(Applause) 02:38There's no question that technology
is changing the way we court: emailing, texting, emojis to express your emotions, sexting, ""liking"" a photograph, selfies ... We're seeing new rules
and taboos for how to court. But, you know -- is this actually
dramatically changing love? What about the late 1940s, when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms? 03:09(Laughter) 03:10How about the introduction
of the birth control pill? Unchained from the great threat
of pregnancy and social ruin, women could finally express
their primitive and primal sexuality. 03:25Even dating sites are not changing love. I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com, I've been it for 11 years. I keep telling them
and they agree with me, that these are not dating sites, they are introducing sites. When you sit down in a bar, in a coffee house, on a park bench, your ancient brain snaps into action
like a sleeping cat awakened, and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors
did 100,000 years ago. We can give you various people -- all the dating sites can -- but the only real algorithm
is your own human brain. Technology is not going to change that. 04:09footnotefootnoteTechnology is also not going to change
who you choose to love. I study the biology of personality, and I've come to believe that we've evolved four very broad
styles of thinking and behaving, linked with the dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen systems. So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science to measure the degree to which
you express the traits -- the constellation of traits -- linked with each
of these four brain systems. I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites in 40 countries. Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire, and I've been able to watch
who's naturally drawn to whom. 04:54And as it turns out, those who were very expressive
of the dopamine system tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic -- I would imagine there's an awful lot
of people like that in this room -- they're drawn to people like themselves. Curious, creative people
need people like themselves. People who are very expressive
of the serotonin system tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules, they respect authority, they tend to be religious -- religiosity
is in the serotonin system -- and traditional people
go for traditional people. In that way, similarity attracts. In the other two cases, opposites attract. People very expressive
of the testosterone system tend to be analytical,
logical, direct, decisive, and they go for their opposite: they go for somebody who's high estrogen, somebody who's got very good verbal skills and people skills, who's very intuitive and who's very nurturing
and emotionally expressive. We have natural patterns of mate choice. Modern technology is not going
to change who we choose to love. 05:57footnotefootnoteBut technology is producing
one modern trend that I find particularly important. It's associated with the concept
of paradox of choice. For millions of years, we lived in little hunting
and gathering groups. You didn't have the opportunity to choose between 1,000 people on a dating site. In fact, I've been studying this recently, and I actually think there's some
sort of sweet spot in the brain; I don't know what it is, but apparently,
from reading a lot of the data, we can embrace about five
to nine alternatives, and after that, you get into what academics
call ""cognitive overload,"" and you don't choose any. 06:36footnotefootnoteSo I've come to think that due
to this cognitive overload, we're ushering in a new form of courtship that I call ""slow love."" I arrived at this during
my work with Match.com. Every year for the last six years, we've done a study called
""Singles in America."" We don't poll the Match population, we poll the American population. We use 5,000-plus people, a representative sample of Americans
based on the US census. 07:04We've got data now on over 30,000 people, and every single year, I see some of the same patterns. Every single year when I ask the question, over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand -- not necessarily last year,
but in their lives -- 50 percent have had
a friends with benefits during the course of their lives, and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term before marrying. Americans think that this is reckless. I have doubted that for a long time; the patterns are too strong. There's got to be some
Darwinian explanation -- Not that many people are crazy. 07:41footnotefootnoteAnd I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me. It was a very interesting academic article in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today who are living long-term with somebody, have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce. They're terrified of the social, legal, emotional, economic consequences of divorce. So I came to realize that I don't think
this is recklessness; I think it's caution. Today's singles want to know
every single thing about a partner before they wed. You learn a lot between the sheets, not only about how somebody makes love, but whether they're kind, whether they can listen and at my age, whether they've got a sense of humor. 08:29(Laughter) 08:31And in an age where we have
too many choices, we have very little fear
of pregnancy and disease and we've got no feeling of shame
for sex before marriage, I think people are taking
their time to love. 08:46And actually, what's happening is, what we're seeing is a real expansion
of the precommitment stage before you tie the knot. Where marriage used to be
the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale. But the human brain -- 09:01(Laughter) 09:03footnotefootnoteThe human brain always triumphs, and indeed, in the United States today, 86 percent of Americans
will marry by age 49. And even in cultures around the world
where they're not marrying as often, they are settling down eventually
with a long-term partner. 09:17So it began to occur to me: during this long extension
of the precommitment stage, if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry, maybe we're going to see
more happy marriages. So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America -- not on Match.com, of course -- and I asked them a lot of questions. But one of the questions was, ""Would you re-marry the person
you're currently married to?"" And 81 percent said, ""Yes."" 09:48footnotefootnoteIn fact, the greatest change
in modern romance and family life is not technology. It's not even slow love. It's actually women
piling into the job market in cultures around the world. For millions of years, our ancestors lived
in little hunting and gathering groups. Women commuted to work
to gather their fruits and vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80
percent of the evening meal. The double-income family was the rule. And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. 10:24Then the environment changed
some 10,000 years ago, we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women
became obliged, really, to marry the right person, from the right background, from the right religion and from the right kin
and social and political connections. Men's jobs became more important: they had to move the rocks,
fell the trees, plow the land. They brought the produce
to local markets, and came home with the equivalent of money. 10:49Along with this, we see a rise of a host of beliefs: the belief of virginity at marriage, arranged marriages --
strictly arranged marriages -- the belief that the man
is the head of the household, that the wife's place is in the home and most important, honor thy husband,
and 'til death do us part. These are gone. They are going, and in many places, they are gone. 11:14We are right now in a marriage revolution. We are shedding 10,000 years
of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian
relationships between the sexes -- something I regard as highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit. 11:33I'm not a Pollyanna; there's a great deal to cry about. I've studied divorce in 80 cultures, I've studied, as I say,
adultery in many -- there's a whole pile of problems. As William Butler Yeats,
the poet, once said, ""Love is the crooked thing."" I would add, ""Nobody gets out alive."" 11:51(Laughter) 11:53We all have problems. But in fact, I think the poet
Randall Jarrell really sums it up best. He said, ""The dark, uneasy world
of family life -- where the greatest can fail,
and the humblest succeed."" 12:08But I will leave you with this: love and attachment will prevail, technology cannot change it. And I will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships
must take into account one the most powerful determinants
of human behavior: the unquenchable, adaptable and primordial human drive to love. 12:33Thank you. 12:34(Applause) 12:39Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you
so much for that, Helen. As you know, there's another
speaker here with us that works in your same field. She comes at it
from a different perspective. Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
who works with couples. You study data, Esther studies the stories
the couples tell her when they come to her for help. Let's have her join us on the stage. Esther? 13:02(Applause) 13:10So Esther, when you were watching Helen's talk, was there any part of it that resonated with you
through the lens of your own work that you'd like to comment on? 13:20Esther Perel: It's interesting,
because on the one hand, the need for love
is ubiquitous and universal. But the way we love -- the meaning we make out of it -- the rules that govern
our relationships, I think, are changing fundamentally. 13:35We come from a model that, until now, was primarily regulated
around duty and obligation, the needs of the collective and loyalty. And we have shifted it to a model of free choice
and individual rights, and self-fulfillment and happiness. And so, that was
the first thing I thought, that the need doesn't change, but the context and the way
we regulate these relationships changes a lot. 14:02On the paradox of choice -- you know, on the one hand
we relish the novelty and the playfulness, I think, to be able to have so many options. And at the same time, as you talk about this cognitive overload, I see many, many people who ... who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this massa of choice, creating a case of ""FOMO"" and then leading us -- FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
or fear of missing out -- it's like, ""How do I know
I have found 'the one' -- the right one?"" 14:40So we've created what I call
this thing of ""stable ambiguity."" Stable ambiguity is when
you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing
to engage in intimacy-building. It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup. So, here on the internet
you have three major ones. One is icing and simmering, which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined
nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you
enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom
of the undefined boundaries. 15:21(Laughter) 15:24Yeah? 15:25And then comes ghosting. And ghosting is, basically, you disappear from this massa
of texts on the spot, and you don't have to deal with
the pain that you inflict on another, because you're making it
invisible even to yourself. 15:39(Laughter) 15:41Yeah? 15:42So I was thinking -- these words came up
for me as I was listening to you, like how a vocabulary
also creates a reality, and at the same time, that's my question to you: Do you think when the context changes, it still means that the nature
of love remains the same? 16:02You study the brain and I study
people's relationships and stories, so I think it's everything you say, plus. But I don't always know the degree
to which a changing context ... Does it at some point begin to change -- If the meaning changes,
does it change the need, or is the need clear
of the entire context? 16:23HF: Wow! Well -- 16:25(Laughter) 16:27(Applause) 16:30Well, I've got three points here, right? First of all, to your first one: there's no question that we've changed,
that we now want a person to love, and for thousands of years,
we had to marry the right person from the right background
and right kin connection. And in fact, in my studies
of 5,000 people every year, I ask them, ""What are you looking for?"" And every single year,
over 97 percent say -- 16:53EP: The list grows -- 16:54HF: Well, no. The basic thing is
over 97 percent of people want somebody that respects them, somebody they can trust and confide in, somebody who makes them laugh, somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find
physically attractive. That never changes. And there's certainly -- you know,
there's two parts -- 17:15EP: But you know how I call that? That's not what people used to say -- 17:19HF: That's exactly right. 17:21EP: They said they wanted somebody
with whom they have companionship, economic support, children. We went from a production economy
to a service economy. 17:28(Laughter) 17:29We did it in the larger culture,
and we're doing it in marriage. 17:32HF: Right, no question about it. But it's interesting, the millennials
actually want to be very good parents, whereas the generation above them
wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused
on being a good parent. You see all of these nuances. 17:46There's two basic parts of personality: there's your culture -- everything you
grew up to do and believe and say -- and there's your temperament. Basically, what I've been talking
about is your temperament. And that temperament is certainly
going to change with changing times and changing beliefs. 18:01And in terms of the paradox of choice, there's no question about it
that this is a pickle. There were millions of years
where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hole, and you went for it. 18:13EP: Yes, but you -- 18:14HF: I do want to say one more thing. The bottom line is, in hunting
and gathering societies, they tended to have two or three partners
during the course of their lives. They weren't square! And I'm not suggesting that we do, but the bottom line is,
we've always had alternatives. Mankind is always -- in fact, the brain is well-built
to what we call ""equilibrate,"" to try and decide: Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay? What are the opportunities here? How do I handle this there? And so I think we're seeing
another play-out of that now. 18:44KS: Well, thank you both so much. I think you're going to have
a million dinner partners for tonight! 18:48(Applause) 18:50Thank you, thank you."

are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship. They view their bond as a shield
from the loneliness of aging. 00:12I first met them at a retirement
home in Los Angeles, where I had been photographing
for three years. I saw as they approached
the gate one night, and felt an immediate connection to them. Although I didn't know the details
of their love triangle, I intuitively felt
that I had to find out who they were. Questioning a nurse
a day later, she said to me, ""Oh, you're talking about the threesome."" 00:40(Laughter) 00:41I was intrigued. 00:42(Laughter) 00:45The trio set out on a daily adventure
to coffee and doughnut shops, bus stops and street corners. I soon learned that the purpose
of these outings was solace and a search for meaning. The trio sought to combat their alienation by literally integrating themselves
in public streets. Yet, even when arm in arm,
no one saw them. 01:10We often think that as we age,
we lose the desires held in our youth. Actually, as a teenage photojournalist
when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion
and desires for intimacy that I also carried. I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset
as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy. As we walked down
the streets of Hollywood, in a neighborhood of screenwriters,
actors and filmmakers, the trio assumed the invisibility
that each senior does. I would ask myself, ""How is it that no one else
sees these three human beings? Why is it that I am
the only one who sees them?"" 02:04Years later, as I began to share
this work with the public, I noticed that people are largely
uncomfortable with this story. Perhaps it is because the trio
doesn't assume conventional notions associated with love,
romance or partnership. They were unseen in public
and shunned by their peers. They wanted to belong somewhere but only seemed to belong with each other. I wanted to belong somewhere, too. And my camera has been a catalyst
for me to belong everywhere. 02:38But beyond challenging sociocultural
norms about the elderly, the trio sheds light
on fear of remoteness. At the end of each day, they return
to their respective retirement homes. Under the surface of their aloneness, there is a desire for community,
for their people. There was a sense that they were each
yearning for their tribe, but that comfort comes with compromise, because Will cannot commit to one woman. 03:10Sitting with Jeanie one day
in her apartment, she said to me, ""Sharing Will is a thorn in your side. A relationship between a man
and a woman is private. It is a couple, not a trio."" 03:25My process is to essentially
become the people I document by spending years with them
as an observer-occupant, to create a safe space,
to then become hidden in plain sight. 03:38I was about 17 when I met the trio, and I shadowed them for four years. We actually see, in the breakdown
of social development, that adolescence and old age
look strikingly alike, because both are periods
of identity confusion. I identified with the women. But also with Will, who made me
aware of the divide in me. The schism that we each often have about what we crave
and the actuality of our situation. 04:11Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different
people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought. But I also knew what it was like
to be at the base of the triangle, like Jeanie or Adina, asking myself, ""Why aren't I enough?"" I would look through my viewfinder
and see three elderly figures, and it became impossible to deny
that regardless of age, we were each in pursuit of filling
the proverbial hole through other people. 04:46Perhaps the discomfort of looking
at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story is truly a reminder
that even at the end of life, we may never reach the fantasy
we have envisioned for ourselves. Thank you for listening. 05:02(Applause)"

incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because 
it often makes people doubt their perceptions 
of their own mistreatment. 01:04So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. 01:13First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. 01:43Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. 02:14Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re<i> </i>hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. 02:56Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. 03:38So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know

1,How understanding divorce can help your marriage,Jeannie Suk Gersen,Apr 2020,"To understand what makes marriages work, we need to talk about why they sometimes end, says family law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen. Follow along as she lays out three ways that thinking about marital decisions through the lens of divorce can help you better navigate togetherness from the beginning.", (90K),"Transcript (24 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00""Till death do us part."" When we get married, we make vows. To love, to honor, to forsake all others. Or as a friend of mine put it, ""Not to leave dirty socks
all over the house."" 00:17(Laughter) 00:19We may fall short of some of our promises some of the time, but one that will always hold true
is that first one: ""Till death do us part."" Because spouses are bound together
by their decisions, in marriage and in divorce. 00:40So, a mentor of mine once told me, ""You should always marry
your second husband first."" 00:48(Laughter) 00:53What did that mean? It didn't mean that Mr. Right
is somehow waiting behind door number two. It meant that if you want to understand what makes a marriage work, you should think
about how a marriage ends. Divorce makes extremely explicit what the tacit rules of marriage are. And everyone should
understand those rules, because doing so can help us build
better marriages from the beginning. I know, it doesn't sound very romantic, but sometimes the things we do out of love can be the very things
that make it hard for that love to last. 01:48I am a family-law professor. I have taught students, I've been an attorney, I'm a mediator and I've also been divorced. And I'm now happily married
to my actual second husband. 02:04(Laughter) 02:07The reason that I think
this is so important is that I think everyone should be having
some of these very painful conversations that divorced people experience. These are painful conversations
about what we contributed, what we owe, what we are willing to give and what we give up. And also, what's important to us. Those conversations should be happening
in a good marriage, not after it is broken. Because when you wait until it's broken, it's too late. But if you have them early on, they can actually help build
a better marriage. 02:59Three ideas that I want
to put on the table for you to consider. One, sacrifice should be thought of
as a fair exchange. Two, there's no such thing
as free childcare. And three, what's yours
probably becomes ours. So let me talk about each of these ideas. 03:26The first one, sacrifice should be a fair exchange. Take the example of Lisa and Andy. Lisa decides to go to medical school
early in the marriage, and Andy works to support them. And Andy works night shifts
in order to do that, and he also gives up a great job
in another city. He does this out of love. But of course, he also understands that Lisa's degree
will benefit them both in the end. But after a few years,
Andy becomes neglected and resentful. And he starts drinking heavily. And Lisa looks at her life
and she looks at Andy and she thinks, ""This is not the bargain
I wanted to make."" A couple of years go by, she graduates from medical school, and she files for a divorce. 04:16So in my perfect world, some kind of marriage mediator
would have been able to talk to them before Lisa went to medical school. And at that point,
that mediator might have asked, ""How exactly does fair exchange work? What does it look like in your marriage? What are you willing to give
and what are you willing to owe?"" So in a divorce, Lisa now probably is going to owe Andy
financial support for years. And Andy ... no amount of financial support
is going to make him feel compensated for what he gave up, and the lost traction in his career. 05:05If the two of them had thought
about their split early on, what might have gone differently? Well, it's possible that Lisa
would have decided that she would take loans
or work a part-time job in order to support her own tuition so that Andy wouldn't have had to bear
the entire burden for that. And Andy might have decided
to take that job in that other city and maybe the two of them
would have commuted for a couple of years while Lisa finished her degree. 05:37So let's take another couple,
Emily and Deb. They live in a big city, they have two children, they both work. Emily gets a job in a small town, and they decide to move there together. And Deb quits her job
to look after the children full-time. Deb leaves behind an extended family, her friends and a job that she really liked. And in that small town,
Deb starts to feel isolated and lonely. And 10 years later, Deb has an affair, and things fall apart. 06:14Now, the marriage mediator
who would have come in before they moved
and before Deb quit her job might have asked them, ""What do your choices about childcare do to the obligations
you have to each other? How do they affect your relationship? Because you have to remember that there is no such thing
as free childcare."" 06:38If the two of them had thought
about their split beforehand, what would have gone differently? Well, maybe Deb would have
realized a little better how much her family and her friends
were important to her precisely in what she was taking on, which is full-time parenthood. Perhaps Emily, in weighing the excitement
of the new job offer might have also thought about
what that would mean for the cost to Deb and what would be owed to Deb as a result of her taking on
full-time parenthood. 07:17So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy. Lisa had an inheritance
from her grandmother before the marriage. And when they got married,
they bought a home, and Lisa put that inheritance
toward a down payment on that home. And then Andy of course worked
to make the mortgage payments. And all of their premarital
and marital property became joined. That inheritance is now marital property. So, in a split, what's going to happen? They're going to have to sell the house
and split the proceeds, or one of them can buy the other out. 07:55So this marriage mediator, if they had talked to them
before all of this happened, that person would have asked, ""What do you want to keep separate
and what do you want to keep together? And how does that choice actually support the security
of the marriage? Because you have to remember that what's yours,
probably, will become ours, unless you actually are mindful
and take steps to do otherwise."" 08:28So if they had thought about their split, maybe they would have decided differently, maybe Lisa would have thought, ""Maybe the inheritance can stay separate,"" and saved for a day
when they might actually need it. And maybe the mortgage that they took on
wouldn't have been as onerous, and maybe Andy wouldn't have had
to work so hard to make those payments. And maybe he would have
become less resentful. Maybe they would have lived
in a smaller house and been content to do that. 08:59The point is, if they had had
a divorce-conscious discussion about what to keep separate, their marriage might have been
more connected and more together. Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices, and we demand them, without reckoning their cost. But there is wisdom
in looking at the price tags attached to our marital decisions in just the way that divorce law
teaches us to do. 09:32What I want is for people to think
about their marital bargains through the lens of divorce. And to ask, ""How is marriage a sacrifice, but an exchange of sacrifice? How do we think about our exchange?"" Second: ""How do we think about childcare and deal with the fact that there is no such thing
as free childcare?"" ""How do we deal with the fact that some things can be separate
and some things can be together, and if we don't think about it, then it will all be part
of the joint enterprise."" 10:14So basically, what I want to leave you with
is that in marriage or divorce, people should think about the way that ""till death do us part"" marriage is forever. 10:33Thank you. 10:34(Applause)"
1,How reverse mentorship can help create better leaders,Patrice Gordon,Nov 2020,"Employee diversity and inclusive leadership are goals for most organizations today, but how do we get there? Try a ""reverse mentorship"" program, which sets up junior team members to guide senior staff. Here are 6 tips to make reverse mentorship work, from executive coach and personal development advocate Patrice Gordon.", (11K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Translate @ TED, TranslatorIvana Korom, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00We've always thought of mentoring as the older generation
passing down wisdom to the young, but there's a huge benefit
to flipping that around and allowing the novice
to teach the master. 00:09[The Way We Work] 00:12[Made possible
with the support of Dropbox] 00:14The workforce currently consists
of up to five generations and it's becoming more diverse across all spectrums
of underrepresented groups. But that change
is not arriving nearly as fast in C-suites and in boardrooms. Which means there's a growing gap between leaders and their people in regards to their
perspectives and experiences. 00:30Our organizations can fall
right through that gap into the trap of stale
thinking, blind spots and having policies that could alienate these underrepresented groups, not only in regards to age, race or gender, but all different kinds of viewpoints. 00:45Reverse mentoring could be an antidote
to that tunnel vision. But making reverse mentoring work, isn't as simple as finding a mentor and pressing go. You have to be genuinely curious about learning from that individual. And you have to be intentional
about the relationship in order to make it valuable. 01:00I know this because I was asked just a year into my career
at Virgin Atlantic to be the first ever reverse mentor to mentor CEO Craig Kreeger. I'd met Craig a few times and presented to him in meetings, but this, it was a whole
different ball game. Craig had revealed
that he had no black women in his inner circle and he was keen
to understand my perspective on how to build a more inclusive
culture at Virgin Atlantic. No pressure. Here's what I learned about how to make reverse mentoring work. 01:26Lesson one, make your match thoughtfully. Find someone who has a pulse on the key spokespeople
in the organization to help you make your match. This doesn't have to be
someone in human resources, just someone who knows you
and your teams well, because chemistry really matters. The VP of people experience chose me because I was open to sharing my ideas and also my enthusiasm
for leadership development. 01:46Also make sure that your mentor isn't a direct report
or part of your team, because it will be really difficult
to elicit honest feedback from someone who you also have to review at the end of the year. If you're in finance, find someone creative in marketing, or if you're in engineering,
find someone in customer service. This will ensure
that you develop perspectives from outside of your immediate team and different perspectives
make better leaders. 02:09Lesson two, to make things simple,
set some ground rules. The first meeting should be offsite
in a neutral location. If you're the mentee,
you should set the agenda. What is it that you really want to learn? Maybe you'd like to understand your mentor's career journey or perhaps whether
they've had any major obstacles they've had to overcome, or maybe you'd like to understand how specific company policies impact them either directly or indirectly. 02:32Agree that your conversations together will be confidential and whether there are any topics
which are off limits, such as family life or specific feedback on individuals. 02:41Lesson three, start with an icebreaker. I like to think of this as a long elevator pitch
of your life stories. Who are you? Poignant moments in your life. What are your hopes and dreams? Pivot to seek differences
and not similarities because that's the real power
of reverse mentoring. Craig and I found that we had formative
experiences in common. Both of us immigrants, him a second generation
growing up in the US and myself first generation arriving in the UK from Jamaica at the age of three. But from there, our stories are quite different. 03:11Lesson four, beware of role reversion. There were a few times in our conversation where Craig slipped
into giving me career advice. And I had to say,
""Craig this is really interesting and I'd love to come back to this later, but in our limited time together, is there anything else you'd
like to understand from me?"" Now this was quite hard, but you have to remember that as a mentor for this very short period of time, your insights are actually more valuable
to the organization. 03:33Lesson five, make time for reflection. Agree the key takeaways
from each of the sessions, either at the end
or through follow-up email and schedule your sessions to allow time between for reflection. We found that three to four weeks
provided a great rhythm. 03:47And finally, give credit where credit's due. In the traditional mentoring relationship the mentor isn't expected
to be given credit. However, in reverse mentoring where the mentee actually
holds a lot of the power accurate credit really counts. 04:02Forward-thinking organizations use reverse mentoring as one of the tools to help them build
a more inclusive environment. And studies have shown that when organizations
embrace reverse mentoring members of those underrepresented groups feel more confident
in sharing their perspectives. And when accompanied
by a comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy, it leads to higher retention
amongst these groups. 04:23Personally, I found that my reverse mentoring
relationship with Craig enabled me to have a sense
of ownership and leadership in building an inclusive
culture at Virgin. And for Craig, it showed that even when you're
at the pinnacle of your career, there's still more you can learn."

laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. 00:51The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. 01:06Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. 01:40In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. 02:18Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. 03:18This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. 03:50The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. 04:54At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically 
complex issues."
1,Beautiful new words to describe obscure emotions,John Koenig,Mar 2017,"John Koenig loves finding words that express our unarticulated feelings -- like ""lachesism,"" the hunger for disaster, and ""sonder,"" the realization that everyone else's lives are as complex and unknowable as our own. Here, he meditates on the meaning we assign to words and how these meanings latch onto us.", (59K),"Transcript (37 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsO'zbekPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىहिन्दीภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words, how we define them and how they, almost as revenge, define us. 00:09The English language
is a magnificent sponge. I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it. But for all that, it has a lot of holes. In Greek, there's a word, ""lachesism"" which is the hunger for disaster. You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm. In Mandarin, they have a word ""yù yī"" -- I'm not pronouncing that correctly -- which means the longing
to feel intensely again the way you did when you were a kid. In Polish, they have a word ""jouska"" which is the kind of
hypothetical conversation that you compulsively
play out in your head. And finally, in German,
of course in German, they have a word called ""zielschmerz"" which is the dread
of getting what you want. 01:03(Laughter) 01:08Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream. I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like. 01:15Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words as I go about my day, but I'm really glad they exist. But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up. 01:25I am the author of ""The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"" which I've been writing
for the last seven years. And the whole mission of the project is to find holes
in the language of emotion and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes and quirks of the human condition that we all feel
but may not think to talk about because we don't have the words to do it. 01:53And about halfway through this project, I defined ""sonder,"" the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character and everyone else is just extras. But in reality,
we're all the main character, and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story. And so as soon as I published that, I got a lot of response from people saying, ""Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life but there was no word for that."" So it made them feel less alone. That's the power of words, to make us feel less alone. 02:32And it was not long after that that I started to notice sonder being used earnestly
in conversations online, and not long after I actually noticed it, I caught it next to me
in an actual conversation in person. There is no stranger feeling
than making up a word and then seeing it
take on a mind of its own. I don't have a word
for that yet, but I will. 02:55(Laughter) 02:57I'm working on it. 02:59I started to think
about what makes words real, because a lot of people ask me, the most common thing
I got from people is, ""Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."" And I didn't really know what to tell them because once sonder started to take off, who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't. And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day, we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much and just sort of get on with things. But once you realize that people -- that this world was built
by people no smarter than you, then you can reach out
and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have
the power to change it. 03:47And when people ask me,
""Are these words real?"" I had a variety of answers
that I tried out. Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't. But one of them I tried out was, ""Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."" The way that this path is real
because people wanted it to be there. 04:04(Laughter) 04:06It happens on college
campuses all the time. It's called a ""desire path."" 04:09(Laughter) 04:10But then I decided,
what people are really asking when they're asking if a word is real,
they're really asking, ""Well, how many brains
will this give me access to?"" Because I think that's
a lot of how we look at language. A word is essentially a key that gets us into certain people's heads. And if it gets us into one brain, it's not really worth it, not really worth knowing. Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is. A million brains, OK, now we're talking. And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can. That's what makes it worth knowing. 04:50Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this. 04:54[O.K.] 04:56That's it. The realest word we have. That is the closest thing we have
to a master key. That's the most commonly
understood word in the world, no matter where you are. The problem with that is, no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for. 05:09(Laughter) 05:11Which is kind of weird, right? I mean, it could be a misspelling
of ""all correct,"" I guess, or ""old kinderhook."" No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter says something about
how we add meaning to words. The meaning is not
in the words themselves. We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it. 05:33And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives, and searching for the meaning of life, I think words have
something to do with that. And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something, the dictionary is a decent place to start. It brings a sense of order to a very chaotic universe. Our view of things is so limited that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands and try to figure out
a way to interpret it and be able to get on with our day. We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves. 06:09I think a lot of us feel boxed in by how we use these words. We forget that words are made up. It's not just my words.
All words are made up, but not all of them mean something. We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us, and so I think I feel us drifting apart
a little more every year, the more seriously we take words. 06:39Because remember, words are not real. They don't have meaning. We do. 06:46And I'd like to leave you with a reading from one of my favorite philosophers, Bill Watterson, who created
""Calvin and Hobbes."" He said, ""Creating a life that reflects
your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it is still allowed, and I think you'll be
happier for the trouble."" 07:11Thank you. 07:12(Applause)"
1,What emotions look like in a dog's brain,Gregory Berns,Jul 2019,"How do dogs feel about their owners? In this talk, neuroscientist Dr. Gregory Berns explains how advanced brain imaging technologies could help us answer better understand the emotional bonds that exist between humans and our canine companions.", (87K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishPortuguês brasileiroРусскийעבריתالعربيةQueenie Lee, Translator00:17How many of you are dog people? A show of hands. Excellent! How about cat people? OK, you guys can go to the break early. (Laughter) So, of the dog people and the cat people
who want to be dog people, (Laughter) how many of you have thought, ""Wouldn't it be great to know
what my dog is thinking?"" I think everyone else already knows
what their dog is thinking, right? I got into this project, and I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how - This is basically
a stupid dog trick story. It really started
with this dog named Newton, who was really my favorite dog. I've had many dogs through my life,
but Newton was my favorite, and he lived to be about 15 years old. After he passed away, I thought, I have these tools, this MRI machine,
that I have been using for decades to study human decision making
and what motivates people, why haven't we used this on other animals? Certainly, other animals have many of the same feelings
and motivations that people do. But this is kind of an area of science
that people don't like to talk about. So I embarked on this project
about four years ago to try to figure out what dogs think,
and specifically what dogs think of us. If we're talking about humans, we have kind of two ways we can think about what
other people are thinking: we can either ask them,
and sometimes they will tell us if they know, and they want us
to know what they are thinking; or we can observe actions,
we can observe behaviors, we can try to infer things about what
people are thinking from their actions. With animals, and dogs, of course,
we can't really ask them. We can ask them,
and we may think that they tell us, but we really don't know
what they're thinking. So we're kind of left
with their behaviors: we can observe their actions, and we can try to infer
what they are thinking. This is the foundation of behaviorism,
and it's been around since Pavlov. But there are, of course,
very tricky issues here, and humans being humans,
we tend to anthropomorphize everything. It's kind of in this area that I became very interested 
in intrigued with the possibility of trying to figure out what dogs
are thinking by using MRI. The technique is straightforward.
It's been around for decades. The idea is: if we were studying a human, we would put a human in an MRI,
have them do some type of task, and we'd measure blood flow
or brain activity and then try to figure out
what parts of the brain do what. Very straightforward,
if you've had an MRI, it's not terribly pleasant,
but people will do it. How do we do this with other animals?
How do we do it with a dog? I'm going to show you what we found.
 Here's a short video. It's a what we call our training video,
and it demonstrates how we did this. Before I start it, you're going to see
two dogs in this video. The first dog, Callie, is my dog. She was actually
the replacement for Newton. She was adopted here in Atlanta
from the Humane Society. We loved Newton so much;
we could never get another pug, so Callie is the anti-pug. The other dog is McKenzie,
a border collie. We just kind of get right into it. I'll narrate as we go along. [Callie - Introduction to head coil] This's Mark Spivak. He's my partner in this endeavor,
he's a dog trainer. The first thing that we had to do
 is figure out how do we get dogs
to go into a tube, to put a head coil around their head
to pick up the brain waves, and hold absolutely still. What you are seeing here, is that
Callie is not a particularly obedient dog; she has no particularly special skills. But she does have one very good trait,
and that is: she likes hot dogs. Mark is doing what we call
clicker training. Every time she approximates
what we want her to do, he clicks, and then she gets a hot dog. This's the very first time she's been introduced
to the thing we call the head coil, and we didn't know at this point
 whether this was even
going to be possible. [McKenzie - Introduction to head coil] This dog, McKenzie,
a border collie, is highly trained. She's very skilled in agility,
 and her owner, as you'll see,
gets her to sit in this coil very quickly. (Video) Dog owner: Good girl! Yes! Is she too far out now? (Video) Gregory Berns: Yeah, basically, we are looking for the brain case
to be in the center, right there. That's good. (On stage) GB: If you've had an MRI, you know that you're told
not to move, right? This is the big challenge of doing this. [Mckenzie - Holding without any chin rest] Up until this point, I didn't know if this was going
to be possible until I saw this. This was literally
after about five minutes of training. When I saw that, I knew we could do this. [Callie - Training with chin rest] What you saw McKenzie doing was close
but not quite good enough. What we are going after
 if we're to achieve data
that compares to humans - (Video) GB: You are perfect! 
Excellent! Perfect job! (On stage) GB: Mark told me
I had to be more demonstrative than I am normally. (Laughter) (Video) GB: Perfect! Yes! (Laughter) (On stage) GB: What you notice we did
was we introduced a little chin rest because we have to give the dogs
a target to put their head on. McKenzie adapts this very quickly. She's actually in a simulator
for an MRI that we built. She's doing quite well, but this is actually
still too much movement. The really difficult part of this
is the noise that the scanner makes, playing in the background. These are recordings that we made
to acclimate the dogs to the training. It's very loud. This's being played at low volume
just to get her used to it. But it's really about 95 decibels, and it's like jackhammer loud. (Video) GB: That's it,
that what we are doing! (On stage) GB: This is after
about a month or two of training. [Callie - Scammer training] We're at the real MRI now. This's probably the most expensive
training session ever performed. (Laughter) We get charged about 500 dollars
an hour to use the MRI. (Laughter) But we had to use the real thing
at a certain point. At this point, we didn't even know how
they would react to the magnetic field. The key thing I want you to notice is these dogs are doing it willingly,
and they enjoy it. That is the whole point of this project. We treat these animals
as family members. We don't sedate them,
and we don't restrain them. [Callie - Final training] This's actually after
about two months of training. We made some modifications
to the chin rest, and even a shelter dog
like Callie can do this. [Full chin rest, ear muffs,
tube, hand signals] If you look carefully, you also notice
that she's wearing ear muffs. It's very important because the scanner is so loud,
and the dogs hearing is quite sensitive. [This means ""hot dog""] The other thing that we did - (Laughter) This's a scientific experiment, really. (Laughter) [This means ""no hot dog""] That's the training video. The ""hot dog, no hot dog"" hand signals, we started with this because we didn't know
if this was going to work, so we decided we needed
to do something really simple. This's just straight up
Pavlovian conditioning where we taught the dogs
two hand signals: this means ""hot dog,""
and this means ""no hot dog."" If this technique works, what we should see is activity
in the reward system of their brain to this hand signal but not this signal. I also put up a slide here. Once we started doing this, the word got out amongst
the community here in Atlanta that we're doing this crazy
dog scanning project. We're looking for volunteers, especially people who like to train dogs
and have dogs that are very well behaved. That's still true. If you have a dog that can do this
or you think can do this, talk to me. Because the project is still going on,
and it's gotten quite large. You've seen the kind of preliminary video. This's one of my favorite photos
because it's kind of captures - this is the first day
we were actually doing the scanning. It captures the human confusion here. We were just standing around trying
to figure out how we are going to do this. But Callie knows, she's been trained,
she's been doing this for two months; so she's ready to go. The head wrap is just
to keep the ear muffs in place. This is what it look likes
from the other end, from the business end of the scanner. This's actually a dog named Zen.
He's a yellow lab golden retriever. What we're studying initially
is just the reward system response. Very simply, we got
these two hand signals, and the idea is we compare
the brain response to these two things. As I said, we have many dogs
doing this now, it's not just shelter dogs. We have dogs from
service dog organizations, we have shelter dogs -
really all sorts of breeds. Before I show you some of the results, I do want to say something
about brain anatomy. A dog brain - this slide is not to scale. A dog brain is probably about the size
of a plum or a lemon maybe, depending on the size of the dog. It's not big, even if you have a big dog, most of the head is muscle,
so just going to be aware of that. But I like putting up this slide because it shows
the similarities of animal brains. You can immediately
make out common structures. You can see towards the right
that kind of pretty structure is the cerebellum that controls
various types of motor movement, and then below that,
there is the brainstem. The really the parts of the brain
that are different are what we call the cortex. That's the upper part, the folded part. The big differences between dog and human
have to do with the size of the cortex and how folded it is. What folding accomplishes is packing a lot more brain surface area
into a specific volume. Generally speaking, the more folded a brain,
the more surface area, the more brain power, if you will. There are lot of similarities,
and there are some differences. What I am particularly interested in
are the similarities. Because if we were to have a commonality
of experience with dogs, and other animals for that matter, we have to share the same
or similar brain structures. Darwin said this 150 years ago. What do the results look like? This's a very compact way
of summarizing an experiment which I showed you where the dogs
receive two different hand signals, and we've averaged the results over,
in this case, 12 dogs, I think though, we've done this
probably in over 20 dogs. The orange areas show
 what parts of the brain are more active
to this reward signal, this hot dog signal. What I want to emphasize is the brain response
is not directly to hot dogs, it's to the hand signal
that means hot dogs. You may think that's not a big deal;
it's still hot dogs. It's no surprise that dogs like hot dogs. But it is a big deal
because we train this signal; it's a symbolic representation
of a hot dog that the dog has learned and has learned
to recognize this meaning. The particular parts of the brain that are being active
are the reward system. There's kind of two hot spots. There's a headlight type picture. That's in an area of the brain
called the cortex nucleus. It's the area of the brain
that all mammals have, and it's the area that has the most
dopamine receptors in the brain. It's kind of the key center that links
reward and motivation with action. Normally, when that's active
in a human or any other animal, it means that something
important has happened, and the animal needs to do something. In this case it's quite simple
because they will just eat the hot dogs. Well, so what? So we proved that dog brains
like hot dogs. That was just the beginning. This started about four years ago, and we've since gone on
and done many other experiments. Most of the dogs in these pictures,
are still working with us in the project. We've done things looking at how their olfaction, 
or their sensory system for smell works, how they identify different people, and other dogs
in their household by smell. One of the things that we found
is that this reward system, the same part of the brain activates
when the dogs smell a familiar human, even if the human is not there. It shows that dogs
have representations of us of our identities that persist
when we are not there. When people ask me,
""Do dogs miss us when we are gone?"" I have to say yes because we find evidence
that they are remembering their humans, that they care about them, and that it's associated
with these reward responses. Is it still just hot dogs? To answer this question,
one of the other things that we did was we actually repeated
the experiment I showed you, where we show
the different hand signals. With one little twist:
we manipulate who gives the signals. Does it matter if the dog's
owner gives a signal? Or whether a stranger comes in
and gives the signal? Or even whether a computer
gives the signal? Because if you believe Pavlov,
and all the behaviorist who followed him, it really shouldn't matter, because any signal that indicates
an upcoming food treat is all the same, if animals and dogs
are just kind of robots. But in fact, we did find a difference. What's very interesting about it
is that not all dogs are the same. For example, my dog Callie
had a much greater response in that part of the brain when a stranger gave the signals
or even a computer as opposed to me! (Laughter) Other dogs in the project, some of the golden retrievers in the labs
can have had the opposite pattern, where their owners had really elicited
the strongest brain response. This is very interesting because what it does is it provides us with a neural biomarker
of the dog's personality profile. In fact, what we've done
is we've spun off a new project which we're very excited about. We've partnered with Canine Companions for Independence, which is the largest service dog training
organization in the United States. If you know anything about service dogs,
they're incredibly difficult to train. It's very expensive,
and there's a very low success rate. Roughly about 35% of dogs
that enter these programs to train to be assistance dogs
will succeed; the other 2/3 end up being released
and adopted to their puppy raisers. So we've partnered with CCI, and they're actually training their dogs
to do the MRI procedure. What we're going to do
is try to predict which of those dogs
will actually be good service dogs. I really love this project because it shows 
that even though we started this just as my silly example
of trying to understand what my dogs think,
and whether they love me, it's actually gotten much bigger. Dogs are special. They're the first domesticated animals. They have been with humans
since humans have been humans. When we look at their brains, it's almost like we
are looking back in time, and it's giving us a picture
of how the dog-human bond formed. Thank you. (Applause)"
1,How to speak up for yourself,Adam Galinsky,Nov 2016,"Speaking up is hard to do, even when you know you should. Learn how to assert yourself, navigate tricky social situations and expand your personal power with sage guidance from social psychologist Adam Galinsky.", (220K),"Transcript (31 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىગુજરાતીతెలుగుქართული中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Speaking up is hard to do. I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago, when my wife and I became new parents. It was an amazing moment. It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying. And it got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital, and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding. And we wanted to call our pediatrician, but we also didn't want
to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy,
neurotic parent. So we worried. And we waited. When we got to the doctor's office
the next day, she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated. Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her. But in that moment, I should've spoken up, but I didn't. 00:58But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't, and I learned that over 10 years ago
when I let my twin brother down. My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer
from a distribution company. He was excited, and he was inclined to accept the offer. But as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one. And it was perfect -- it was perfectly insulting. The company was so offended, they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing. 01:36And I've asked people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interests, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask. 01:48And the range of stories
are varied and diverse, but they also make up
a universal tapestry. Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake? Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes? Can I challenge my friend's
insensitive joke? Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities? 02:10footnotefootnoteAnd through these experiences,
I've come to recognize that each of us have something called
a range of acceptable behavior. Now, sometimes we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much. That's what happened with my brother. Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior. But sometimes we're too weak. That's what happened with my wife and I. And this range of acceptable behaviors -- when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded. When we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways. We get dismissed or demeaned
or even ostracized. Or we lose that raise
or that promotion or that deal. 02:49footnotefootnoteNow, the first thing we need to know is: What is my range? But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic. It expands and it narrows
based on the context. And there's one thing that determines
that range more than anything else, and that's your power. Your power determines your range. What is power? Power comes in lots of forms. In negotiations, it comes
in the form of alternatives. So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power. The company had lots of alternatives; they had power. Sometimes it's being new
to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents. Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate. Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested
than the other person. 03:43And the key thing is that when
we have lots of power, our range is very wide. We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. But when we lack power, our range narrows. We have very little leeway. The problem is that when
our range narrows, that produces something called
the low-power double bind. The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up,
we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished. 04:13footnotefootnoteNow, many of you have heard
the phrase the ""double bind"" and connected it with one thing,
and that's gender. The gender double bind is women
who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished. And the key thing is that women have
the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. But what my research has shown
over the last two decades is that what looks
like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind. And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power
differences in disguise. Oftentimes we see a difference
between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, ""Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different about the sexes."" But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation
for many sex differences is really power. And so it's the low-power double bind. And the low-power double bind
means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power. We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large. 05:22So we need to find ways
to expand our range. And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter. The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes. The second: you seem powerful
in the eyes of others. When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range. When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior. And I'm going to give you
a set of tools today. Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up. 06:03footnotefootnoteThe first tool I'm going to give you
got discovered in negotiations in an important finding. On average, women make
less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men
at the bargaining table. But Hannah Riley Bowles
and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation
where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious. That's when they advocate for others. When they advocate for others, they discover their own range
and expand it in their own mind. They become more assertive. This is sometimes called
""the mama bear effect."" Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice. 06:50But sometimes, we have
to advocate for ourselves. How do we do that? One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking. And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person. It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range. When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me
what I really want. 07:21footnotefootnoteBut here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do. So let's do a little experiment. I want you all to hold
your hand just like this: your finger -- put it up. And I want you to draw
a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible. OK, it turns out that we can
draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking. I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead -- my former student, Erika Hall. And you can see over here, that's the correct E. I drew the E so it looks like
an E to another person. That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E
from someone else's vantage point. But this E over here
is the self-focused E. We often get self-focused. And we particularly get
self-focused in a crisis. 08:14footnotefootnoteI want to tell you
about a particular crisis. A man walks into a bank
in Watsonville, California. And he says, ""Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank
up with a bomb."" Now, the bank manager
didn't give him the money. She took a step back. She took his perspective, and she noticed something
really important. He asked for a specific amount of money. 08:36So she said, ""Why did you ask for $2,000?"" 08:41And he said, ""My friend
is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately."" 08:45And she said, ""Oh! You don't want
to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan."" 08:50(Laughter) 08:51""Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."" 08:55(Laughter) 08:57Now, her quick perspective-taking
defused a volatile situation. So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious
and assertive, but still be likable. 09:09Here's another way to be assertive
but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility. Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,
and you want to sell someone a car. You're going to more likely make the sale
if you give them two options. Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car
and a five-year warranty. Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty. My research shows that when you give
people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely
to accept your offer. 09:42footnotefootnoteAnd this doesn't just
work with salespeople; it works with parents. When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything. But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea. What if I gave my daughter a choice? This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt. This pant or that pant? OK, that pant. And it worked brilliantly. She got dressed quickly
and without resistance. 10:05When I've asked the question
around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: ""When I have social support
in my audience; when I have allies."" So we want to get allies on our side. How do we do that? Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear. When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes
and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies. 10:31footnotefootnoteAnother way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice. When we ask others for advice,
they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility. And this really works to solve
another double bind. And that's the self-promotion double bind. The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments, no one notices. And if we do, we're not likable. 11:01footnotefootnoteBut if we ask for advice
about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent
in their eyes but also be likeable. And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming. There have been multiple times in life
when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given
the advice to come ask me for advice. I want you to notice
three things about this: First, I knew they were going
to come ask me for advice. Two, I've actually done research
on the strategic benefits of asking for advice. And three, it still worked! I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them
because they asked for advice. 11:46Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up is when we have expertise. Expertise gives us credibility. When we have high power,
we already have credibility. We only need good evidence. When we lack power,
we don't have the credibility. We need excellent evidence. 12:05And one of the ways
we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion. I want everyone in the next few days
to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, ""I want you to describe
a passion of yours to me."" I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, ""What did you notice
about the other person when they described their passion?"" And the answers are always the same. ""Their eyes lit up and got big."" ""They smiled a big beaming smile."" ""They used their hands all over -- I had to duck because their
hands were coming at me."" ""They talk quickly
with a little higher pitch."" 12:42(Laughter) 12:43""They leaned in
as if telling me a secret."" 12:45And then I said to them, ""What happened to you
as you listened to their passion?"" 12:50They said, ""My eyes lit up. I smiled. I leaned in."" 12:55When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage,
in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission
from others to speak up. Tapping into our passion even works
when we come across as too weak. Both men and women get punished
at work when they shed tears. But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when
we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying
disappears for both men and women. 13:28I want to end with a few words
from my late father that he spoke at my twin
brother's wedding. Here's a picture of us. My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real
passion was cinema, like my brother. And so he wrote a speech
for my brother's wedding about the roles we play
in the human comedy. 13:50And he said, ""The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving
and enriching your performance. Those who embrace their roles
and work to improve their performance grow, change and expand the self. Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful."" 14:08What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned
ranges and roles in this world. But he was also saying
the essence of this talk: those roles and ranges are constantly
expanding and evolving. 14:24So when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker. Have excellent evidence and strong allies. Be a passionate perspective taker. And if you use those tools -- and each and every one of you
can use these tools -- you will expand your range
of acceptable behavior, and your days will be mostly joyful. 14:52Thank you. 14:53(Applause)"

for all of them. I was a home-birth midwife
throughout my 20s. Delivering babies taught me
valuable and sometimes surprising things, like how to start a car at 2am. when it's 10 degrees below zero. 00:25(Laughter) 00:26Or how to revive a father
who's fainted at the sight of blood. 00:30(Laughter) 00:31Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so, to make a beautiful belly button. 00:36But those aren't the things
that stuck with me or guided me when I stopped being a midwife
and started other jobs. What stuck with me was this bedrock belief that each one of us comes into this world
with a unique worth. When I looked into the face of a newborn, I caught a glimpse of that worthiness, that sense of unapologetic selfhood, that unique spark. I use the word ""soul""
to describe that spark, because it's the only word in English
that comes close to naming what each baby brought into the room. 01:20Every newborn was as singular
as a snowflake, a matchless mash-up of biology and ancestry and mystery. And then that baby grows up, and in order to fit into the family, to conform to the culture, to the community, to the gender, that little one begins to cover its soul, layer by layer. We're born this way, but -- 01:49(Laughter) 01:51But as we grow, a lot
of things happen to us that make us ... want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity. We've all done this. Everyone in this room is a former baby -- 02:07(Laughter) 02:08with a distinctive birthright. But as adults, we spend so much
of our time uncomfortable in our own skin, like we have ADD:
authenticity deficit disorder. But not those babies -- not yet. Their message to me was: uncover your soul and look for that soul-spark in everyone else. It's still there. 02:35And here's what I learned
from laboring women. Their message was about staying open, even when things are painful. A woman's cervix normally looks like this. It's a tight little muscle at the base of the uterus. And during labor,
it has to stretch from this to this. Ouch! If you fight against that pain, you just create more pain, and you block what wants to be born. 03:06I'll never forget the magic
that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain and opened. It was as if the forces
of the universe took notice and sent in a wave of help. I never forgot that message, and now, when difficult
or painful things happen to me in my life or my work, of course at first I resist them, but then I remember
what I learned from the mothers: stay open. Stay curious. Ask the pain what it's come to deliver. Something new wants to be born. 03:45And there was one more big soulful lesson, and that one I learned
from Albert Einstein. He wasn't at any of the births, but -- 03:52(Laughter) 03:53It was a lesson about time. At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life is an illusion. We run round and round, faster and faster, trying to get somewhere. And all the while, underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension where the past and the present
and the future merge and become deep time. And there's nowhere to get to. 04:30Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension, ""only being."" And he said when he experienced it, he knew sacred awe. When I was delivering babies, I was forced off the hamster wheel. Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours, just breathing with the parents; just being. And I got a big dose of sacred awe. 04:57So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery. One: uncover your soul. Two: when things get difficult
or painful, try to stay open. And three: every now and then,
step off your hamster wheel into deep time. 05:18Those lessons have served me
throughout my life, but they really served me recently, when I took on the most
important job of my life thus far. 05:30Two years ago, my younger sister
came out of remission from a rare blood cancer, and the only treatment left for her
was a bone marrow transplant. And against the odds,
we found a match for her, who turned out to be me. I come from a family of four girls, and when my sisters found out that
I was my sister's perfect genetic match, their reaction was, ""Really? You?"" 06:00(Laughter) 06:02""A perfect match for her?"" Which is pretty typical for siblings. In a sibling society,
there's lots of things. There's love and there's friendship
and there's protection. But there's also jealousy and competition and rejection and attack. In siblinghood, that's where we start
assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul. 06:30When I discovered I was my sister's match, I went into research mode. And I discovered that the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward. You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy, and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor. And then you do everything you can to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient. I also learned that bone marrow
transplants are fraught with danger. If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy, she still would face other challenges. My cells might attack her body. And her body might reject my cells. They call this rejection or attack, and both could kill her. 07:27Rejection. Attack. Those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings. My sister and I had
a long history of love, but we also had a long history
of rejection and attack, from minor misunderstandings
to bigger betrayals. We didn't have
the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff; but, like many siblings and like people
in all kinds of relationships, we were hesitant to tell our truths, to reveal our wounds, to admit our wrongdoings. 08:05But when I learned about
the dangers of rejection or attack, I thought, it's time to change this. What if we left the bone marrow
transplant up to the doctors, but did something that we later came
to call our ""soul marrow transplant?"" What if we faced any pain
we had caused each other, and instead of rejection or attack, could we listen? Could we forgive? Could we merge? Would that teach our cells to do the same? 08:41To woo my skeptical sister,
I turned to my parents' holy text: the New Yorker Magazine. 08:47(Laughter) 08:49I sent her a cartoon from its pages as a way of explaining
why we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvested
and transplanted into her body. Here it is. 09:03""I have never forgiven him for that thing
I made up in my head."" 09:07(Laughter) 09:10I told my sister we had probably been doing the same thing, carting around made-up stories
in our heads that kept us separate. And I told her that after the transplant, all of the blood flowing in her veins would be my blood, made from my marrow cells, and that inside the nucleus
of each of those cells is a complete set of my DNA. ""I will be swimming around in you
for the rest of your life,"" I told my slightly horrified sister. 09:45(Laughter) 09:47""I think we better clean up
our relationship."" 09:52A health crisis makes people
do all sorts of risky things, like quitting a job
or jumping out of an airplane and, in the case of my sister, saying ""yes"" to several therapy sessions, during which we got down to the marrow. We looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other and blame and shame until all that was left was love. 10:26People have said I was brave
to undergo the bone marrow harvest, but I don't think so. What felt brave to me was that other kind
of harvest and transplant, the soul marrow transplant, getting emotionally naked
with another human being, putting aside pride and defensiveness, lifting the layers and sharing with each other
our vulnerable souls. I called on those midwife lessons: uncover your soul. Open to what's scary and painful. Look for the sacred awe. 11:05Here I am with my marrow cells
after the harvest. That's they call it -- ""harvest,"" like it's some kind of bucolic
farm-to-table event -- 11:14(Laughter) 11:15Which I can assure you it is not. And here is my brave, brave sister receiving my cells. After the transplant, we began to spend
more and more time together. It was as if we were little girls again. The past and the present merged. We entered deep time. I left the hamster wheel of work and life to join my sister on that lonely island of illness and healing. We spent months together -- in the isolation unit, in the hospital and in her home. 11:58Our fast-paced society does not support or even value
this kind of work. We see it as a disruption
of real life and important work. We worry about the emotional drain
and the financial cost -- and, yes, there is a financial cost. But I was paid in the kind of currency our culture
seems to have forgotten all about. I was paid in love. I was paid in soul. I was paid in my sister. 12:32My sister said the year after transplant
was the best year of her life, which was surprising. She suffered so much. But she said life never tasted as sweet, and that because of the soul-baring and the truth-telling
we had done with each other, she became more unapologetically herself with everyone. She said things
she'd always needed to say. She did things she always wanted to do. The same happened for me. I became braver about being authentic
with the people in my life. I said my truths, but more important than that,
I sought the truth of others. 13:19It wasn't until
the final chapter of this story that I realized just how well
midwifery had trained me. After that best year of my sister's life, the cancer came roaring back, and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do. They gave her just
a couple of months to live. 13:40The night before my sister died, I sat by her bedside. She was so small and thin. I could see the blood pulsing in her neck. It was my blood, her blood, our blood. When she died, part of me would die, too. 14:00I tried to make sense of it all, how becoming one with each other had made us more ourselves, our soul selves, and how by facing and opening
to the pain of our past, we'd finally been delivered to each other, and how by stepping out of time, we would now be connected forever. 14:26My sister left me with so many things, and I'm going to leave you now
with just one of them. You don't have to wait
for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships
that matter to you, to offer the marrow of your soul and to seek it in another. We can all do this. We can be like a new kind
of first responder, like the one to take
the first courageous step toward the other, and to do something or try to do something other than rejection or attack. We can do this with our siblings and our mates and our friends and our colleagues. We can do this with the disconnection and the discord all around us. We can do this for the soul of the world. 15:24Thank you. 15:25(Applause)"

Are they attractive? Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity? We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name? Where are you from? How old are you? What do you do? Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases? Have you ever been divorced? Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now? What are you into? Who are you into? What gender do you like to sleep with? 00:35I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes, though, just the question ""what do you do?"" can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. 01:14So here's a disclaimer about me, though, before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s, two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing. Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo. (Laughter) It was an unorthodox upbringing, but as a kid on the streets of New York, you learn how to trust your own instincts, you learn how to go with your own ideas. 01:53So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, ""I'm a boy."" I mean, who knows, right? When you're six, maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. 02:16So this is me when I was 11. I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called ""Julian Po."" I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See, I was also a child actor, which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity, because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. 03:05It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant, and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. 03:38When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right? No one is exactly shocked. (Laughter) But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later, when I fell in love with a man, neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment. 04:19So four, almost five years ago, Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate, was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time, getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country, between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. 04:59If this was a war with two disparate sides, I, by default, fell on team gay, because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy, over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was, a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. 05:35I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself, who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear, girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish, girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees, girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people, and I admired their freedom, but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen. 06:27I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character? How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else? Were we even a group? What group? And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination? Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was? 06:57And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party, so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice, without any lighting, or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. 07:31For me, photography is not just about exposing film, it's about exposing the viewer to something new, a place they haven't gone before, but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits, mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight, which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people. 08:05(Laughter) 08:07So this was a very large undertaking, and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold, and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. 08:31(Music) 08:43Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. (Music) 09:00Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face. (Music) 09:22""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."" It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States. 09:33[""What does equality mean to you?""] [""Marriage""] [""Freedom""] [""Civil rights""] [""Treat every person as you'd treat yourself""] 09:40It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in 29 states, more than half of this country, you can legally be fired just for your sexuality. 09:54[""Who is responsible for equality?""] 09:58I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer: ""We are all responsible for equality."" So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being. (Music) 10:28[""Self evident truths""] [""4,000 faces across America""] 10:32(Music) (Applause) 10:45iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost 85,000 people watched that video, and then they started emailing us from all over the country, asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces. That video was made in the spring of 2011, and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people. 11:18I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. 11:57So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas, we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family, you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. 12:37But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting: Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them. It presents, not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings, but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few. 13:07At some point I realized that my mission to photograph ""gays"" was inherently flawed, because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help, and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. (Laughter) People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness? 13:46Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks. Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other, but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as ""Grey."" 14:09Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative, because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice, I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. (Laughter) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this: If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here, and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another, there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. 14:59And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line? Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far? Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far? Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen? 15:26Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people, let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs, and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle, just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. 16:08So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. 17:02So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing, the right to adopt children, the right to marriage, the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here? Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman? It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things, and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period. 17:45Thank you. 17:46(Applause)"

about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years. But I want to start
with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you
about that first, and then go on into where
I think love is going. 00:36(Laughter) 00:38""What 'tis to love?"" Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been
wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on
what I call, ""special meaning."" As a truck driver once said to me, ""The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."" 01:21George Bernard Shaw said it differently. ""Love consists of overestimating
the differences between one woman and another."" And indeed, that's what we do. 01:30(Laughter) 01:33And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you
don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said, ""Love is blind."" 01:46In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world, and I just want to give
you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party. And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat. 02:19And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. ""I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. 02:37But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said,
""I felt like jumping in the sky."" You're up all night.
You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation
when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me, ""Anything she liked, I liked."" Simple. Romantic love is very simple. 03:10You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually, you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely
sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this. The whole point of this
is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team. 03:33But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving: an intense craving
to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you
on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic
is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person. 04:01And last but not least,
it is an obsession. Before I put these people
in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question
was always the same. It was: ""What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"" And indeed, they would say, ""All day. All night. I can never stop thinking
about him or her."" 04:25And then, the very last question -- I would always have to work
myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say,
""Would you die for him or her?"" And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. 04:47So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens. 05:15I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win
that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. 05:43And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected
in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. 06:27And I've also come to think that it's one of three
basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it
an ""intolerable neural itch,"" and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner. 07:00And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment,
the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team. So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends. One of the last 10,000 years and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner. 07:54The first is women working,
moving into the workforce. I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving
into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women in terms of economic power,
health and education. It's very slow. 08:26For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend. We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, ""The dogs may bark,
but the caravan moves on."" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market,
because this is not new. For millions of years,
on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80 percent
of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. In short, we're really
moving forward to the past. 09:12Then, women's worst
invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture,
men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution
and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short, they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago. We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. 09:50I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women
on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things,
and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think
that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot
that we do not have in common. 10:11We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, ""I think that we are like two feet.
We need each other to get ahead."" But we did not evolve
to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more
gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. 10:31Women's ability to find the right word
rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation,
they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years;
words were women's tools. They held that baby
in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words. And, indeed, they're becoming
a very powerful force. 10:57Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television
is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman. In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, ""To have a great writer
is to have another government."" 11:29Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women. It's one of many, many
characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills,
negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination, of long-term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns,
see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual,
holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers. 12:08Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more
step-by-step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good
ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact, there's many more
male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more
male idiots in the world. 12:31(Laughter) 12:33When the male brain works well,
it works extremely well. And what I really think
that we're doing is, we're moving towards
a collaborative society, a society in which the talents
of both men and women are becoming understood
and valued and employed. 12:49But in fact, women moving
into the job market is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life. Foremost, women are starting
to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished
when people come to me and say, ""Why is it that men are so adulterous?"" ""Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women?"" ""Well, men are more adulterous!"" And I say, ""Who do you think
these men are sleeping with?"" 13:15(Laughter) 13:16And -- basic math! 13:18Anyway. In the Western world, women start sooner at sex,
have more partners, express less remorse
for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression. And, indeed, once again we're moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. 13:52We're also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what
they call the ""symmetrical marriage,"" or the ""pure marriage,""
or the ""companionate marriage."" This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit. 14:21We're also seeing a rise of romantic love. 91 percent of American women
and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody
who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person. People around the world,
in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love
with the person that they marry. Indeed, arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life. 14:55I even think that marriages
might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women
moving into the job market, the second one being
the aging world population. They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded
as up to age 85. Because in that highest
age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real
extension of middle age. 15:26For one of my books,
I looked at divorce data in 58 societies. And as it turns out, the older you get,
the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been
as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable. And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages, that time is now. 16:16However, there's always kinds
of complications in this. These three brain systems --
lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together. They can go together, by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just
fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm, then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. 16:49But these three brain systems:
lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment
to a long-term partner while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners. In short, we're capable of loving
more than one person at a time. In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting
going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal
that was built to be happy; we are an animal
that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find, we make. And I think, however, we can make good relationships
with each other. 17:46So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over 100 million prescriptions
of antidepressants are written every year
in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been
on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
antidepressants -- since she was 13. She's 23. She's been on them
ever since she was 13. 18:25I've got nothing against people
who take them short term, when they're going
through something horrible. They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people
in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place. 19:24So now -- 19:25(Applause) 19:30Thank you. 19:31I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment. I've been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years. I'm an identical twin;
I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago, an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them. I said, ""I don't know anything
about personality. You know? I don't know. Do you think
you've got the right person?"" They said, ""Yes."" It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. 20:16That's my current project;
it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love
with one person rather than another. Timing is important.
Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody
who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within
what I call your ""love map,"" an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood
as you grow up. And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now
contributing to this. 20:54But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate. I've been carrying on here
about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too, the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had
heard it just from one -- probably a true story. It was a graduate student --
I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people
in the MRI machine. 21:25And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him. And they were
all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody, you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love. 21:49(Laughter) 21:51So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him. 22:00And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy
and it's exciting. He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing
and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, ""Wasn't that wonderful?"" And, ""Wasn't that rickshaw
driver handsome!"" 22:32(Laughter) 22:35(Applause) 22:42There's magic to love! 22:43(Applause) 22:44But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner. These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive
as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called
""this mortal coil."" 23:06Thank you. 23:07Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher! 23:08(Applause)"
1,What you don't know about marriage,Jenna McCarthy,Feb 2012,"In this funny, casual talk from TEDx, writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages (especially happy marriages) really work. One tip: Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress.", (205K),"Transcript (38 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиҚазақ тіліעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make
a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest
of their lives together -- 00:13(Laughter) 00:15And not to have sex with anyone else. Ever. He buys a ring, she buys a dress. They go shopping for all sorts of things. She takes him to Arthur Murray
for ballroom-dancing lessons. And the big day comes. And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad
once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing -- not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery -- will ever put the tiniest damper
on their eternal love and devotion. 00:56(Laughter) 00:58These optimistic young bastards
promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain, until that far-off day, when one of them
is finally able to rest in peace. 01:17(Laughter) 01:18You know, because they can't hear
the snoring anymore. And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each other's faces
and do the Macarena. And we'll be there, showering them with towels and toasters
and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them
every single time ... even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced
within a decade. 01:43(Laughter) 01:46Of course, the other half won't, right? They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating -- 01:55(Laughter) 01:56Which way the toilet paper
should come off of the roll. And some of them will even still
be enjoying each other's company when neither of them can chew
solid food anymore. 02:09And researchers want to know why. I mean, look -- it doesn't take
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes
a marriage not work: disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people. But you can have the exact
opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go
to hell in a handbasket. So, what's going on when it doesn't? What do the folks who make it all the way
to side-by-side burial plots have in common? What are they doing right? What can we learn from them? And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing
and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy
for the rest of your life? 03:09Well, researchers spend
billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. They stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism. And they try to pinpoint
what it is that sets them apart from their miserable
neighbors and friends. And it turns out, the success stories
share a few similarities, beyond that they don't have sex
with other people. 03:34For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better-looking than the husband. 03:41(Laughter) 03:42Obvious. Right? It's obvious that this leads
to marital bliss, because women -- we care a great deal
about being thin and good-looking, whereas men mostly care about sex, ideally, with women who are thinner
and better looking than they are. The beauty of this research, though, is that no one is suggesting
that women have to be thin to be happy. We just have to be thinner
than our partners. So instead of all that laborious
dieting and exercising, we just need to wait
for them to get fat -- 04:13(Laughter) 04:14Maybe bake a few pies. This is good information to have,
and it's not that complicated. 04:20(Laughter) 04:21Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones
that focus on the positives. For example: the happy wife. Instead of pointing out
her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, ""Wow, honey, thank you
for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner."" 04:41(Laughter) 04:42These are couples
who can find good in any situation. ""Yeah, it was devastating
when we lost everything in that fire. But it's kind of nice sleeping
out here under the stars. And it's a good thing you've got
all that body fat to keep us warm."" 04:57(Laughter) 04:58One of my favorite studies found that the more willing
a husband is to do housework, the more attractive
his wife will find him. Because we needed a study to tell us this. 05:09(Laughter) 05:10But here's what's going on here. The more attractive she finds him,
the more sex they have; the more sex they have,
the nicer he is to her; the nicer he is to her, the less she nags him
about leaving wet towels on the bed, and ultimately,
they live happily ever after. In other words, men,
you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. 05:31Here's an interesting one. One study found that people
who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. This is an actual study,
and let me clarify: the researchers were not looking
at documented self-reports of childhood happiness, or even studying old journals. The data were based entirely
on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
but when I was a kid, your parents took pictures
with a special kind of camera that held something called ""film."" And, by God, film was expensive. They didn't take 300 shots of you
in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest,
smiliest one for the Christmas card. Oh, no. They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera
like they told you to or you could kiss
your birthday party goodbye. But still, I have a huge pile
of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely
than some people to get a divorce. 06:38So, what else can you do
to safeguard your marriage? Do not win an Oscar for best actress. 06:45(Laughter) 06:47I'm serious. Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,
Halle Berry, Hilary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon -- all of them single,
soon after taking home that statue. They actually call it the Oscar curse. It is the marriage kiss of death
and something that should be avoided. 07:04And it's not just successfully
starring in films that's dangerous. It turns out, merely watching
a romantic comedy causes relationship
satisfaction to plummet. 07:15(Laughter) 07:17Apparently, the bitter realization
that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't
and it probably never will, makes our lives seem
unbearably grim in comparison. And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film
where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out
of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. 07:41(Laughter) 07:43Drinking alcohol, it seems,
is bad for your marriage. Yeah. I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it
at the headline. But here's a scary one:
divorce is contagious. That's right, when you have
a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances
of getting a divorce by 75 percent. Now, I have to say,
I don't get this one at all. My husband and I have watched
quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle
with being our age and single in an age of sexting
and Viagra and eHarmony. And I'm thinking they've done
more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. 08:29So now you may be wondering:
Why does anyone get married ever? Well, the US federal government
counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse. A list that includes
visitation rights in jail, but hopefully, you'll never need that one. But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money. We're healthier,
physically and emotionally. We produce happier, more stable
and more successful kids. We have more sex than our supposedly
swinging single friends, believe it or not. We even live longer, which is a pretty compelling argument
for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place. 09:17(Laughter) 09:18Now, if you're not currently experiencing
the joy of the joint tax return, I can't tell you how to find
a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size
and attractiveness, who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends
hovering on the brink of divorce, but I can only encourage you to try, because the benefits, as I've pointed out, are significant. The bottom line is: whether you're in it
or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution
worth pursuing and protecting. So I hope you'll use the information
I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths
against your own risk factors. 09:56For instance, in my marriage,
I'd say I'm doing OK. One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean
and incredibly handsome. So I'm obviously going
to need fatten him up. And like I said, we have
those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously
be trying to break us up. So we have to keep an eye on that. And we do like a cocktail or two. On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing. And also, my husband does
a lot around the house, and would happily never see
another romantic comedy as long as he lives. 10:35So I've got all those things going for me. But just in case, I plan to work extra hard
to not win an Oscar anytime soon. And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same. I'll see you at the bar. 10:50(Laughter) 10:52(Applause)"

that nobody, absolutely nobody, is prepared to hear. I certainly wasn't. 00:08It was three years ago
that I got a call in my office with the test results of a recent scan. I was 35 and finally living
the life I wanted. I married my high school sweetheart and had finally gotten pregnant
after years of infertility. And then suddenly we had a Zach, a perfect one-year-old boy/dinosaur, depending on his mood. And having a Zach suited me perfectly. I had gotten the first job
I applied for in academia, land of a thousand crushed dreams. And there I was, working at my dream job with my little baby and the man I had imported from Canada. 00:54(Laughter) 00:55But a few months before,
I'd started feeling pain in my stomach and had gone to every expert
to find out why. No one could tell me. And then, out of the blue, some physician's assistant
called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer, and that I was going to need
to come to the hospital right away. And all I could think of to say was, ""But I have a son. I can't end. This world can't end. It has just begun."" And then I called my husband,
and he rushed to find me and I said all the true things
that I have known. I said, ""I have loved you forever, I have loved you forever. I am so sorry. Please take care of our son."" And then as I began
the walk to the hospital, it crossed my mind for the first time, ""Oh. How ironic."" I had just written
a book called ""Blessed."" 01:57(Laughter) 02:00I am a historian and an expert in the idea
that good things happen to good people. I research a form of Christianity
nicknamed ""the prosperity gospel,"" for its very bold promise
that God wants you to prosper. I never considered myself
a follower of the prosperity gospel. I was simply an observer. The prosperity gospel believes
that God wants to reward you if you have the right kind of faith. If you're good and faithful, God will give you health and wealth and boundless happiness. Life is like a boomerang: if you're good, good things will always come back to you. Think positively. Speak positively. Nothing is impossible if you believe. 02:46I got interested in this
very American theology when I was 18 or so, and by 25 I was traveling the country
interviewing its celebrities. I spent a decade talking to televangelists with spiritual guarantees
for divine money. I interviewed countless megachurch pastors
with spectacular hair about how they live their best lives now. I visited with people
in hospital waiting rooms and plush offices. I held hands with people in wheelchairs, praying to be cured. I earned my reputation
as destroyer of family vacations for always insisting on being dropped off
at the fanciest megachurch in town. If there was a river
running through the sanctuary, an eagle flying freely in the auditorium, or an enormous spinning golden globe, I was there. 03:42When I first started studying this,
the whole idea of being ""blessed"" wasn't what it is today. It was not, like it is now, an entire line of ""#blessed"" home goods. It was not yet a flood of ""#blessed""
vanity license plates and T-shirts and neon wall art. I had no idea that ""blessed"" would become
one of the most common cultural cliches, one of the most used
hashtags on Instagram, to celebrate barely there bikini shots, as if to say, ""I am so blessed. Thank you, Jesus, for this body."" 04:16(Laughter) 04:20I had not yet fully grasped
the way that the prosperity gospel had become the great civil religion, offering another transcendent account of the core of the American Dream. Rather than worshipping
the founding of America itself, the prosperity gospel
worshipped Americans. It deifies and ritualizes their hungers, their hard work and moral fiber. 04:46Americans believe in a gospel of optimism, and they are their own proof. But despite telling myself, ""I'm just studying this stuff,
I'm nothing like them,"" when I got my diagnosis, I suddenly understood
how deeply invested I was in my own Horatio Alger theology. If you live in this culture,
whether you are religious or not, it is extremely difficult
to avoid falling into the trap of believing that virtue
and success go hand in hand. The more I stared down my diagnosis, the more I recognized
that I had my own quiet version of the idea that good things
happen to good people. Aren't I good? Aren't I special somehow? I have committed zero homicides to date. 05:37(Laughter) 05:39(Applause) 05:41So why is this happening to me? I wanted God to make me good and to reward my faith with just a few
shining awards along the way. OK, like, a lot of shining awards. 05:53(Laughter) 05:54I believed that hardships
were only detours on what I was certain would be
my long, long life. 06:02As is this case with many of us,
it's a mindset that served me well. The gospel of success drove me to achieve, to dream big, to abandon fear. It was a mindset that served me well until it didn't, until I was confronted with something
I couldn't manage my way out of; until I found myself
saying into the phone, ""But I have a son,"" because it was all
I could think of to say. 06:33That was the most difficult
moment to accept: the phone call, the walk to the hospital, when I realized that my own
personal prosperity gospel had failed me. Anything I thought was good
or special about me could not save me -- my hard work, my personality, my humor, my perspective. I had to face the fact that my life
is built with paper walls, and so is everyone else's. 07:04It is a hard thought to accept
that we are all a breath away from a problem that could
destroy something irreplaceable or alter our lives completely. We know that in life
there are befores and afters. I am asked all the time to say
that I would never go back, or that I've gained
so much in perspective. And I tell them no, before was better. 07:33A few months after I got sick,
I wrote about this and then I sent it off to an editor
at the ""New York Times."" In retrospect, taking one of the most
vulnerable moments of your life and turning into an op-ed is not an amazing way
to feel less vulnerable. 07:48(Laughter) 07:49I got thousands of letters and emails. I still get them every day. I think it is because
of the questions I asked. I asked: How do you live
without quite so many reasons for the bad things that happen? I asked: Would it be better to live
without outrageous formulas for why people deserve what they get? And what was so funny
and so terrible was, of course, I thought I asked people to simmer down on needing an explanation
for the bad things that happened. So what did thousands of readers do? Yeah, they wrote to defend the idea
that there had to be a reason for what happened to me. And they really want me
to understand the reason. People want me to reassure them
that my cancer is all part of a plan. A few letters even suggested
it was God's plan that I get cancer so I could help people
by writing about it. People are certain
it is a test of my character or proof of something terrible I've done. They want me to know without a doubt that there is a hidden logic
to this seeming chaos. They tell my husband, while I'm still in the hospital, that everything happens for a reason, and then stammer awkwardly when he says, ""I'd love to hear it. I'd love to hear the reason
my wife is dying."" 09:15And I get it. We all want reasons. We want formulas to predict whether
our hard work will pay off, whether our love and support
will always make our partners happy and our kids love us. We want to live in a world
in which not one ounce of our hard work or our pain
or our deepest hopes will be for nothing. We want to live in a world
in which nothing is lost. 09:46But what I have learned
in living with stage IV cancer is that there is no easy correlation between how hard I try and the length of my life. In the last three years,
I've experienced more pain and trauma than I ever thought I could survive. I realized the other day that I've had
so many abdominal surgeries that I'm on my fifth belly button, and this last one is my least favorite. 10:14(Laughter) 10:17footnotefootnoteBut at the same time,
I've experienced love, so much love, love I find hard to explain. The other day, I was reading the findings of the Near Death Experience
Research Foundation, and yes, there is such a thing. People were interviewed
about their brushes with death in all kinds of circumstances: car accidents, labor and delivery, suicides. And many reported the same odd thing: love. I'm sure I would have ignored it
if it hadn't reminded me of something I had experienced, something I felt
uncomfortable telling anyone: that when I was sure
that I was going to die, I didn't feel angry. I felt loved. It was one of the most surreal things
I have experienced. In a time in which I should have
felt abandoned by God, I was not reduced to ashes. I felt like I was floating, floating on the love and prayers of all those who hummed
around me like worker bees, bringing me notes and socks and flowers and quilts embroidered
with words of encouragement. But when they sat beside me, my hand in their hands, my own suffering began to feel
like it had revealed to me the suffering of others. I was entering a world
of people just like me, people stumbling around in the debris of dreams they thought
they were entitled to and plans they didn't
realize they had made. It was a feeling of being more connected,
somehow, with other people, experiencing the same situation. 11:57And that feeling
stayed with me for months. In fact, I'd grown so accustomed to it that I started to panic
at the prospect of losing it. So I began to ask friends, theologians,
historians, nuns I liked, ""What I am I going to do
when that loving feeling is gone?"" And they knew exactly
what I was talking about, because they had either
experienced it themselves or they'd read about it
in great works of Christian theology. And they said, ""Yeah, it'll go. The feelings will go. And there will be no formula
for how to get it back."" But they offered me
this little piece of reassurance, and I clung to it. They said, ""When the feelings recede like the tides, they will leave an imprint."" 12:45And they do. And it is not proof of anything, and it is nothing to boast about. It was just a gift. So I can't respond to
the thousands of emails I get with my own five-step plan
to divine health and magical floating feelings. I see that the world is jolted by events
that are wonderful and terrible, gorgeous and tragic. I can't reconcile the contradiction, except that I am beginning to believe
that these opposites do not cancel each other out. Life is so beautiful, and life is so hard. 13:30Today, I am doing quite well. The immunotherapy drugs
appear to be working, and we are watching
and waiting with scans. I hope I will live a long time. I hope I will live long enough
to embarrass my son and to watch my husband
lose his beautiful hair. And I think I might. But I am learning to live and to love without counting the cost, without reasons and assurances
that nothing will be lost. 14:05Life will break your heart, and life may take everything you have and everything you hope for. But there is one kind
of prosperity gospel that I believe in. I believe that in the darkness, even there, there will be beauty, and there will be love. And every now and then, it will feel like more than enough. 14:31Thank you. 14:33(Applause)"
1,The truth about faking orgasms,Karen Gurney,Oct 2022,"Whose pleasure is prioritized during sex, and why? Psychosexologist Karen Gurney explains how a lack of equal pleasure in the bedroom actually reflects broader gender inequality in society -- and asks you to reconsider what dynamics are at play, even behind closed doors.", (25K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de Portugalالعربية中文 (简体)00:00Take a moment to think
about your sex life. Don't worry, I'm a professional,
I ask this question all the time. My guess is that most of you
are thinking about solo pleasure or the interaction between you
and someone else, perhaps. There's probably very few of you who are thinking about how your sex life
connects to wider dynamics in society. 00:25Let me explain by starting
somewhere a little different. The gender pay gap has reduced
in the last three decades in the UK, and we have more women
in senior management positions than ever before. But there is also still
such a long way to go. Britain only ranks 21st
in the world for gender equality. And not all women benefit equally
from the advances we've made so far. Today, I'm going to tell you
how the orgasm gap, which is data about gender
inequality from sex science, is a lesser known but powerful indicator
of just how far we still have to go. 01:11Progress towards equality in any area is about breaking free
of entrenched social norms. And this is especially the case in sex. In my work, as a clinical psychologist specializing in helping people
with their sex lives, I noticed that we're often unaware
of how much of how we are sexually is dictated by forces outside of ourselves or outside of our sexual relationships. What we should say, how we're supposed to be, what we're supposed to look like, who does what and when, what we're supposed to be into. These scripts, they're all written for us, and we learn them from language,
from peers and from the media. 01:59I don't know about you, but I'm starting to see
a small change in these scripts. These days, my social media feeds are full of posts
about women's sexual empowerment and women's bodily autonomy
compared to, say, five years ago. And this is great. But in my work, I notice that this change
has not yet translated to real life and to the bedroom. Not that everyone has sex there,
but you know what I mean. 02:27(Laughter) 02:31I see plenty of women in my clinic who tell me that they feel
more empowered than ever to take up space, to call out misogyny, to demand a seat at the table. But when it comes to their sex lives, they can't seem to bring themselves
to feel empowered in the same way. They tell me that they feel
silenced, disempowered and made to feel
that they are the problem. And they don't know how to tackle it. 03:03So why is this happening? Well, we used to think
that women’s orgasms were hard to come by, and that because they were ""tricky,"" this was the obvious explanation as to why when cis men
and cis women have sex together, it's more often the man
who leaves feeling satisfied. This is a common myth. And it's kind of got in the way
of us really noticing and questioning this imbalance
of pleasure across genders. This ""tricky orgasm"" myth
has been challenged by various pieces of sex research
over the last few decades, and we now know
that when people masturbate, there is no difference
in the rates of orgasm or the time taken to orgasm
across genders, turning this idea of women's orgasms
being more complex or taking longer on its head. But this sex science, and the fact that only a minority of women
can come from vaginal penetration without any clitoral stimulation, is still not that widely known, leaving many women feeling
like they are the problem, that they're taking too long or needing something unusual to get there. When in fact, they're entirely normal. Feeling abnormal leads them to fake it, and faking it gives
their partner the wrong idea of what women's bodies need. Meaning the next woman who tries to assert what she wants
or needs with that partner is seen as difficult
or labeled as “hard work.” As a result, research tells us that men
consistently overestimate how often women orgasm
during partnered sex. And underestimate how often
women are faking it. This is the reason why some women
describe partnered sex as like ""listening to your favorite song, but having the radio switched off
before it gets to the best bit."" 05:12(Laughter) 05:16But why does it matter? Well, the first thing to say is that orgasms are not the be-all
and end-all of good sex and we must not treat them as if they are. Good sex can bring connection, stress relief, affirmation,
intimacy and fun. And orgasms are just
another reward like these, that serve to make us feel good and keep humans coming back for more. But what if the pleasure
of one group of people is consistently privileged
over the pleasure of another? What does that tell us about our society? 05:59I mentioned earlier
that people of all genders can orgasm at a similar rate
when they're alone. And that rate is
about 95 percent of the time. The orgasm gap refers
to data from sex science, which tells us how our
chances of orgasming can move from this 95 percent when we have sex with another person. The biggest gap we see
is for women having sex with men. When their chances of orgasming drop from this 95 percent
they might expect alone to around 65 percent
with a regular partner. We see an even bigger gap emerging
with casual or hookup sex between women and men, when women's chance of orgasming
drops further still. Crucially, men's rate of orgasming
when having sex with women stays at around 85 to 95 percent, whether that's a regular partner, casual sex and just as reliably
as when they're on their own. We don't see such a dramatic orgasm gap when LGBTQ+ people
have sex with each other. So, for example, women
having sex with women can expect an orgasm rate
only slightly less than when they're on their own. 07:16This data is important because it tells us that it's gender which is responsible for inequality
in the experience of orgasms. Not anatomy, not capacity for pleasure, but rather whose pleasure
is prioritized as most important. As a society, we still
aren't signed up to an idea that women's sexual pleasure
is as important as men's. We're happy to strive for it, but only if the route to achieving it
doesn't jeopardize men's pleasure in the process. 07:54Now there is a complex mix of factors
which maintains the orgasm gap. Firstly, not knowing what's normal. And feeling as if it's your
body which is wrong. Falling for this old idea that your
orgasms are somehow tricky, even though you know
that they're not when you're alone. Secondly, women being socialized
to put other people's needs first and being polite so as to not hurt
someone else's feelings or ego. And lastly, the simple fact that the patriarchy
shows itself in the way men and women have sex together. The sheer physicality of a sexual script which favors penis and vagina sex
above all else as ""real sex,"" simply suits men's anatomy more. This is one of the reasons we don't see
such a dramatic orgasm gap when women have sex with other women, and we can learn from this. Ditch the script and have more sex which looks like the sex you enjoy alone. 09:05So, what are we to do? Stop faking it. Yes, I know you've all done it. And you're so, so good at it. 09:16(Laughter) 09:17I know it comes from a place
of not feeling normal or wanting to communicate something or trying to protect
someone else's feelings. But all faking does
is strengthen this patriarchal script and means your needs
are less likely to be met over time. We can also notice how inequality
shows up in the bedroom. Is it OK with you that your needs
are sidelined in favor of someone else’s? How does that fit with your values around equality
and other areas of your life? It’s OK to be motivated by something
other than orgasms when you have sex. But this should be your choice to make, not some kind of sexual
glass ceiling based on gender. 10:06And lastly, by showing up for each other. If more women felt able
to be upfront about their pleasure and what their body needs, this would pave the way for women
collectively to benefit. It would mean the next woman who tries
to be open about what her body needs would be less likely to be dismissed
as complex or unusual. It would change the story. It would redress the balance. 10:39But this journey isn't just
for women to take. Men can show up here also, by believing women
when they say what they need. These women are not the outliers
you think they are. They are the voice of change. Men can also show up by understanding that women's capacity for pleasure
is equal to their own and by genuinely championing sex
which has mutual pleasure at its core, even if that means sacrificing their own, more comfortable position
of privilege from time to time. 11:15So, let's start a revolution. After all, who knows what the impact
of gender equality behind closed doors might have on the rest of society. 11:27Thank you. 11:28(Applause and cheers)"

that's me up there. (Laughter) Enjoying the spotlight
or commanding attention does not come naturally to me. Blending into the background,
analyzing and observing a situation, is where I find the most comfort, or, as I'll get to later on in this talk,
when I'm on the road by myself. Unless this lady is with me. Yes, I'm referring to my camera as a lady. (Laughter) She is my safety blanket, and I've spent more time with my camera
than with most people in my life. I'm an artist, I am a photographer, I'm a self-described nomadic creator. It's one of those creative professions
that when you tell people, they say, ""Wow, I wish I could do that!"" Or, ""What do you really do for work?"" (Laughter) Or my personal favorite,
""Did you go to school for this?"" (Laughter) And, as with most things that we don't
have personal experience with, we make our own assumptions and judgments based off of the only tangible things
that we can grab from. So, when you say ""photographer,"" people often think ""weddings,""
or ""high school portraits,"" or the ridiculous way photographers
are depicted in TV and movies. And I am going to show you
what I do and why I do it. Now, when people first meet me
or hear about me, this is what they're interested in. Now, I could stand here and I can talk about how I've brushed
shoulders with world leaders, and my surreal five minutes
that I spent with President Obama. Or I could talk about
photographing Hillary Clinton a week before the election,
after a rally in North Carolina. Or the tremendous emotional weight
for myself photographing Darren Wilson a year after the events in Ferguson,
Missouri, for the New Yorker, to then, only a year later,
photograph Bryan Stevenson, and he is an advocate and a lawyer
based out of Mobile, Alabama, who fights for the under-represented, and we had a conversation about race
that still stays with me today. Or just what's the easiest
and what most people can relate to: celebrity. So, I could talk about Agelina Jolie, or I could talk about the TV icon
that's Sarah Jessica Parker, or I can just talk about the numerous
actors and musicians and notable people that I've interacted with
over the last decade. And I love my job and I love my work, but that's not what I'm here
to talk to you about. I'm going to talk about
when I'm in my 2003 Buick, driving cross-country for weeks at a time, and how that's when I'm feeling
the most fulfilled. But first, I need to give
a little backstory on me and why I do what I do. So, think of it like in an abridged
episode of ""This American Life,"" just not that long. (Laughter) So, I am a white, cis, queer man from a working-class family in New York, and with all things being relative, I didn't grow up 
with the utmost privilege, and it wasn't uniquely terrible either. My parents, however,
were too involved with their own demons for me to ever truly feel seen or heard. And it wasn't necessarily their fault. It was merely just a casualty
of their reality. Depression, addiction, anger, resentment
overwhelmed both of them. When I was seven, my mother
was diagnosed with cancer. It was the first of a decade-long battle
that she ended up surviving from. It was also the same time that she
showed me how to make her a screwdriver. When I was ten, I knew that I was queer,
or that I at least liked boys, and by 13, my mother outed me. It was an experience that let me feeling
like my identity was stripped from me. By 14, my dad had a DUI or two,
I don't really remember. By 16, he moved out of the house, and by 18, I didn't really speak
to either of them. So, my world up until
this point made me feel that my experiences and my feelings would never actually compare
to that of my parents. And intellectually, I knew better, but I didn't actually know
what would make me feel differently. All I knew was that I didn't want
anyone that came into my life to ever feel like they were not seen. And then, I picked up a camera. For me, photography was always
really interesting because of the immediacy
and collaborative nature of it. It would be a way for me to meet people that were outside of the safe mental
bubble that I had created for myself. And so, I started photographing, and as I started interacting
with other people, I realized that the interaction itself
was actually more interesting to me than the photograph. When I started realizing that, and I thought about my dad,
who had recently got sober, I wanted him to feel seen. So, at this point,
he and I were still very estranged, and I was in graduate school and my professor, Collier Schorr,
said something to me that still echoes in my head
pretty much every day: my work was ""too easy,"" and just because I could make
something that ""looked good"" did not mean that it was interesting. And so, I needed to challenge
myself and my craft. Ironically enough, after years of spending
my time making myself feel comfortable, I needed to be uncomfortable again. So, I asked my dad if he would be willing
to sit for a portrait. This was the first one that I took of him. Then, I took a break because I needed
to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out what it was
that I actually wanted to do with him. And so, I continued to photograph him and we started to have a dialogue,
but it was through photographs. And I even actually started
taking portraits of myself with him because I wanted to, at first, just have
a close physical proximity to him. And the idea of this made me realize
I needed full immersion, I needed no easy escape plan. And so, I asked him, kind of not even
thinking it would happen, if he would go on the road trip
that we never took when I was a kid, and surprisingly, he said,
""Yeah, sure, let's do it."" And so, he and I hit the road, and as this happened, we started creating this fantasy
relationship that never actually existed. (Laughter) But the experience
of making these photographs created a bond between the two of us
that we were incapable of doing otherwise. It was my a-ha moment for photography. I was using my camera as a therapist. It became this third party that allowed the two of us
to communicate with each other even when we weren't actually talking. We finally actually saw each other. So, fast-forward about a decade later, and I am no longer working with my dad, but I am photographing strangers
spontaneously that I meet on the road. Now, about a month before the election,
I was having tremendous anxiety and feeling very stagnant
about my work in general. I began seeing friends withdraw and the overall feeling
of frustration on social media. And to be quite honest,
I just wanted to escape. And so, I hit the road, and I didn't have 
any destinations in mind. I just knew I wanted 
to drive cross-country and I wanted to escape. And then, about a day
into being on the road, I realized I needed to be doing something
while I was on the road, because being just with yourself can lead
to a lot, a lot of soul-searching. So, once I realized I wanted
to be doing something, I thought back to the time with my dad and how pivotal
and also very cathartic it was for me, for my craft
and also my mental health. And so, I wanted to do that 
with strangers, and I went on Instagram,
I went on Facebook, I downloaded all of the dating
and hook-up apps, and I started messaging
everyone that I could within every town that I stopped in. Now, when a stranger 
approaches you online, it leads to a little hesitation. And I say ""stranger""
and I just want to let you know I'm utilizing a community
that is already comfortable for me, and that's of gay 
or queer-identifying men. And so, I would send messages with a brief little description
of what I was doing. I wanted to come and meet you,
I wanted to come to your home, we could meet in public,
and I wanted to take your portrait - I got the majority of [them] being noes, and a lot of variations
of, ""That's creepy"" or - (Laughter) ""I don't really photograph well."" But there was something
that did come up pretty often, and it was, ""Why me?"" And it was that other a-ha moment for me. There didn't need to be a ""why me."" I wanted everyone that I interacted with
to not only feel special, but to also feel like their
stories could be heard. So, this body of work, it's called
""The Day of The Lone Wolf,"" and it's from a book called
""The Secret [Language] of Birthdays,"" and it happens to be
the day that I was born on. Now, I casually mentioned
my mother earlier, and it was by no accident. Her and I are still estranged, but I wanted to take
this moment to thank her. When I was younger, she read to me
from The Secret Language of Birthdays, and she used the personality traits that were depicted
for The Day of The Lone Wolf, both to criticize and also
occasionally appraise me, such as emotionally ""sensitive,""
and ""impulsive,"" and ""contradictory."" Now in my mid 30's I've reclaimed my identity as a queer man and I've also reclaimed
The Day of The Lone Wolf, and I'm creating in honor of it. So, since that first road trip, I've gotten cross-country two more times, and the only thing that you actually know
about these photographs is the common denominator is me. Now, everyone has a story,
you've been listening to mine - And so, while you may not know
the particulars of their struggles or of their achievements
or even of their privilege, there is one thing that you do know: they allowed themselves
to be vulnerable with a stranger, and that's what I've done with you today. Thank you. (Applause)"
1,How to speed up chemical reactions (and get a date),Aaron Sams,Jun 2012,"The complex systems of high school dating and chemical reactions may have more in common than you think. Explore five rules for speeding up chemical reactions in the lab that might just land you a date to a dance! [Directed by Andrew Park, narrated by Aaron Sams].", (55K),"Transcript (21 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:14Meet our chemist, Harriet. She has a chemical reaction
that needs to occur more quickly. A chemist has some processes
at her disposal that can help her speed up her reaction, and she knows of five ways. And to remember them, she thinks back to her days
as a high school student, and the day she got a date for the dance. Harriet was in high school,
studying between classes. She had lost track of time
and was going to be late to class. Unbeknownst to her, Harold, who was just around the corner,
was running late, too. They both sprinted to class and, as it happened, sprinted
directly into one another. Now, this was no small collision. They ran squarely
into one another in such a way that he knocked the books
right out of her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""Let me
help you with your books."" He kindly helped her
re-collect her belongings, and politely offered to walk her to class. And you'll never guess who went
together to the dance later that year. Yup, those two. So as we can see from this example, the key to getting a date for the dance
is to collide with someone and knock the books out of their hands. Now, you're probably already aware that not all collisions lead
to dates for the dance, thankfully. The collisions must have
two important characteristics: One, correct orientation that allows
books to be knocked from one's hands; and two, enough energy
to knock the books out. Shortly after this incident, Harriet decided to tell me,
her chemistry teacher, all about it. I noticed some interesting parallels between her story
and chemical reaction rates, which happened to be
what she was studying in the hallway the day of the collision. Together, we decided
to set out on two missions. Harriet wanted to help all
chemistry students and chemists remember how to speed up
the rate of chemical reactions and I, being the nice guy that I am, decided to make it my mission
to help create educational environments in which more book-dropping
collisions can take place to increase future chemists' chances
of getting a date for the dance. In order to facilitate this improved
dance-date-getting process, I propose five changes to all schools that parallel Harriet's five ways
to increase chemical reaction rates. First, I propose that we shrink
the size of the hallways. This will make it more difficult
to safely navigate the hallways and will cause more collisions
than in larger hallways. And by increasing
the number of collisions, we increase the likelihood that some of those collisions
will have the correct alignment and enough energy
to create a date to the dance. Now, chemically speaking, this is equivalent to lowering
the volume of a reaction vessel or a reaction mixture. In doing so, the individual
particles are closer together, and more collisions will occur. More collisions means a greater likelihood that collisions with the appropriate
energy and configuration will happen. Second, I propose increasing
the overall population of the school. More students equals more collisions. By increasing the number of particles
available for collision, we create an environment
where more collisions can take place. Third, we must reduce the time
allowed between classes -- heck, let's just cut it in half. In doing so, students
will need to move more quickly to get from one class to the next. This increase in velocity
will help make sure collisions have the appropriate
amount of energy necessary to ensure book-dropping. This is analogous to increasing
the temperature of the reaction mixture. Higher temperature
means particles are moving faster. Faster-moving particles means more energy, and a greater likelihood
of the reaction-causing collision. Fourth, students must stop
traveling in packs. By traveling in packs,
the students on the outside of the pack insulate those in the middle
from undergoing any collisions. By splitting up, each student
has more area exposed that is available for a collision
from a passing student. When particles travel in packs,
the surface area is very small, and only the outside
particles can collide. However, by breaking up the clumps
into individual particles, the total surface area is increased, and each particle has
an exposed surface that can react. Fifth and finally, we hire a matchmaker. Is this colliding
and book-dropping too violent? Is there an easier way to get a date
that requires less initial energy? Then a matchmaker will help with this. The matchmaker makes it easier
for a couple to get together, by coordinating the match. Our matchmaker is like a catalyst. Chemical catalysts function
by lowering the activation energy -- in other words, by lowering the energy
required to start a reaction. They do this by bringing
two particles together and orienting them correctly
in space so that the two can meet at the correct configuration
and allow a reaction to take place. So, to sum up: if a future chemist

out of curiosity, that extreme curiosity in understanding the way nature works, our body, the universe, the brain, these 87 billion of interconnected neurons that encode this strange behavior we have, that we don't know 
if we should follow reason or feelings. Science, actually, gives us 
a different perspective of the reality and opens up our minds and amazes us even 
in the most ordinary events. In fact, one of the most 
revolutionary days in my career as a science disseminator was at a neuroscience congress where, walking by the posters section, I read the following work: ""Clitoral stimulation induces 
Fos activation in the rat brain."" Sure, you keep staring at the poster and get closer to the researcher and say: ""Do you stimulate the rats' clitoris?"" (Laughter) ""Yes, I do."" ""And how do you do it?"" ""With a brush; I do three 
or four repetitions and stop. Three or four repetitions and stop. Because that is the way rats copulate."" I kept thinking and she noticed
I was somewhat skeptical. And I said: ""Hey, it is very important
that we investigate the sexual function. We, scientists, investigate the 
complete functioning of the body, why aren't we going to research
on sexuality?"" I thought for a while, and it's true: after so much time working
as a communicator, Why haven't I written about sexuality? Out of taboo? The same taboo society has about sex, is shared by medicine and science. But she said something very curious: ""I study the hormones that encode desire. And I'm convinced about it
because neurophysiologically, we are not that different from rats -- and it's true; psychologically, yes; 
but neurophysiologically, no -- I'm convinced that behind that there could also be an explanation for some male and female issues
related to desire. There are many sexual problems."" ""More than you think,"" she told me. And I was wondering, is it true? I searched for scientific material, and, indeed, I found in ""The Lancet,"" one of the greatest science magazines, data that show that approximately 40 percent of men and more 
than 50 percent of women, even excepting old age, at a certain moment will have a problem related to sexuality. Clearly, it was something
I had to investigate about. And where to start? To see the researcher then and learn about all this hormone issue; testosterone and desire increase, dopamine and pleasure stimulation, prolactin and pleasure decrease, oxytocin segregated after orgasm is the love hormone keeping us together, but also, let's see something --
I teach you right now because, surely, 
you have never seen it before -- (Laughter) clitorial stimulation of rats. It's curious, because a lot of people say: ""I had no idea rats had clitoris."" And some women say: ""Well, there are some men
that seem to ignore women have it too!! (Laughter) But many of us don't know -- I didn't know it, at least
when I started this research -- is that clitoris is much bigger
than we think. It is internal, in most of the cases; on the exterior, the glans
is like the tip of the iceberg Actually, these images you see in grey,
with a triangular shape, is the internal part of the clitoris,
it is like a penis, that grows inside, has an erection and it is so big that gets closer 
to the front wall of the vagina and sometimes, you've heard about G spot... the G spot none of you know about; you know it's a spot that
generates more sexual arousal, but you don't know why. It is because the clitoris gets 
so close to the vagina that when you touch
2 to 3 centimeters upwards, you get in contact with its internal part, and, at that moment, pleasure increases. But truly, what is an orgasm? Orgasm, physiologically, is the activation of the sympathetic
nervous system. That is, to experience
sexual arousal, to be normal, we have a parasympathetic nervous system which keeps us relaxed. But during sexual arousal
there is a moment of explosion when the pupils dilate, the blood flows to the muscles, a series of secretions 
are released in the body that activate this orgasmic response. A piece of advice: for example,
now you know this, if you are having sexual intercourse
and someone groans with pleasure, but pupils are not dilated, 
there is no tachycardia, or no blushing of the upper part of 
the chest or chins, that person may be faking it. It's really important to know that, because these sympathetic nerves 
regulate the coming of the orgasm. For example, when someone is nervous
and has the fibers excited, has premature ejaculation. Or when wine relaxes us, if we drink a lot of wine that slows down
the sympathetic nervous system, women, particularly, take longer to reach orgasm. Or dominance and submission that generate tension in the body
and facilitate orgasm. Or the tantra, that wonderful species 
of sexual behavior that allows the body to feel 
relaxed and excited at the same time and entirely sensitive. I had to move a step forward, because
eventually, when we talk about orgasm, people say: ""Yes, they are clitoral 
or vaginal orgasms."" Actually, they are all brain orgasms. The order to begin orgasm comes 
from the brain. I interviewed Barry Komisaruk. Barry Komisaruk is a researcher
of the Rutgers University who asked women to stimulate different
areas of their genitals to see which areas of their brains 
were activated in order to study the sexual response. It was really interesting, because 
he even saw different types of orgasms. If you haven't felt 
different kind of orgasms it means you haven't experienced enough. Because they are real, different nerves
send the information from the internal part of the vagina, 
from the external part, so it is worth the exploration. But Barry told me something. He said: ""I'm going to start
a research with men. Would you like to be a volunteer?"" And my first answer was: ""No."" And I realized this social restrain
we have regarding sex. I had taken part in a lot of studies; why did I repressed myself from
participation on a study on sexuality? So then I rebelled, and became the first man in the world having an orgasm under a functional
magnetic resonance imaging scan (Laughter) (Applause) And this is my brain from the beginning of the stimulation 
to the end, and it was interesting as it perceived the areas that started; the limbic system, the hypothalamus,
the cortex. Well, in fact, a part of the brain cortex related to control, is the only one off during orgasm. All the rest of the brain was... is the activity that activates most areas
of the brain at the same time; except for this cortex. And it was fantastic, 20 seconds later,
the brain was completely off. And it is very similar to
what happened with women. Actually, the scans were the same; 
men and women. Men and women are more alike than we believe. There is much more diversity 
within the men group and within the women group, than in the opposite sex cases. But this takes place when we move forward
and take the psychological part and here comes the complexity,
because sexuality, indeed, has an endocrine, physiological,
neuroscientific, psychological and cultural side. And now, one of the most peculiar cases is the attraction. Why are we attracted to a certain person 
and not to another? Surely there is a biological aspect. It's said the symmetry is a beauty trait. Surely, there's a cultural part: 
in a culture, we like ones and others. But through experiments you realize that even, the emotional part
plays a relevant role. When we are sad,
we don't like the same people than when we are happy. When you go to a party and feel 
the most attractive woman there, you'll check out certain kind of guys. If you are not that self confident,
and see other women you consider prettier, you will check out other guys. Even hunger affects your choices. And this is a very funny experiment. Half of the students were asked
to come to the experiment satisfied, after having eaten a lot. They had no idea. And other students came hungry, 
with a 10 hours fast. They were shown these images
of the same girl, but they distorted her shape
from a slimmer to a more plump body. And you know what? They were asked which they liked best. and the hungry group liked 
more plump figures. Our inner emotional state conditions our likes in each moment. Talking about attraction, 
there is a very important issue. If I tell you, we should respect 
any sexual diversity it's rather obvious. A lot more people say so. But, I had a question from 
a scientific point of view which is valid from that approach. Can the sexual orientation be changed? It's absurd, we know that, to ask people
to try to change their nature, but, is it possible? And I ran into this scientific study
from 1968 where it was intended,
through electroshocks, and aversive chemical therapy, when they were watching homosexual images, to change gays' sexual orientation. And I interviewed, since he's still alive,
the author, John Bancroft, once the director of Kings Institute. You know what he said?
It was quite revealing. He said, ""We, at that time -- 
now we know it's atrocious -- but we thought we were doing them a favor, because at that time, homosexuality
was not approved and they suffered a lot and we thought we could change them. You know what? Despite their intentions,
and electroshocks, aversive therapy, they didn't change. And the ones who tried it,
bore a great suffering for not changing. So, the conclusion is pretty obvious: the ones to be cured are not homosexuals. The ones are homophobes. (Applause) We... (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) It is essential to accept diversity and we have to be the first ones 
to accept it. For instance, each person lives sexuality
as desired. Kiko is a boy who uses a wheelchair. And has no sensitivity in his genitals. I'm treated as if I were asexual;
as if I had no desire, and of course I have it, 
of course I get aroused, and of course I have 
a different sexuality."" Actually, Kiko is a very sexual person,
who has his partners. Opposite to Rebeca; she is asexual and has no desire. She has never felt desire;
not even as a teenager, and she doesn't feel attracted to anybody
either, neither boys nor girls. This is called an asexual person. And Rebeca told me: ""And you know what?
I'm really happy."" But the key is not about having
more or less sex, it's about having the sex quantity
and quality you want. That's the important thing. Then, we get into this
scientific-sexual adventure into something even more complicated. The couple; it's not about one but two. And here there is a constant interplay
between nature and culture. Because if we look at our nature,
we do have a monogamy tendency, since we are primates -- actually, in this aspect, we are 
more similar to birds than to cats -- because our offspring needs
both progenitors to survive. That's why nature has codified monogamy; that is, the tendency to fall in love 
and have a couple. Monogamy is natural. But not fidelity. There is no animal species that is 
faithful to a partner, even birds, that are such a romantic couple. If they get lost, when going for food and find better genes, they definitely
take the most of it. So, here we have the culture pressure in our relationships with a partner. And it's ok, we have to obey culture
not biology. But, there are people who start looking for other couple models, they look for broadening this behavior to polyamory or swinging in order to adapt them to their needs. I, after all this adventure, realized that there are five steps to have 
a complete sexual life. The first one, to eliminate traumas. Possibly, most of you have no traumas, but the ones who unconsciously have them and are a little haunted 
and not fully aware of them, should have a psychological cleanse. Be at ease with yourselves. Then, health. People always ask me:
""Is sex good for health?"" I say: ""Yes, but health 
has to be good for sex."" That is, the cardiovascular 
and the nervous system, they have to be in very good condition
to have satisfying sexual intercourses. Then, after knowing yourself;
self awareness seems a cliché but I mean knowing how our body works and also our couple; men have the feeling that they
already know a lot of themselves, and... No, no, no. We have to know ourselves better. With these three things: psychological
cleanse, health and self-awareness, we have a satisfactory sex life. Now, if we want to have
a great sex life, it's the turn to open our minds,
read, explore, and, finally, experiment. I wish you a joyful sex life and, above all, enjoy science 
and knowledge as well. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
1,Are we designed to be sexual omnivores?,Christopher Ryan,Feb 2014,"An idea permeates our modern view of relationships: that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships. But before the dawn of agriculture, humans may actually have been quite promiscuous. Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature, in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination, shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships.", (70K),"Transcript (27 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right. 00:09So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a
heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors, hotel room, your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you, sir. (Laughter) So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. 00:38Now what does this tell us? It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex, and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this, but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here, and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought, got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. 01:04Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes, despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related
to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant, as Jared Diamond pointed
out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas, orangutans, what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them, and as you'll see in terms of our behavior, we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today, the question I want to explore with you today is, what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality? Now, since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution, and you're all familiar with it, even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that, as part of human nature, from the beginning of our species' time, men have sort of leased
women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status, protection, things like that. And in exchange, women have offered fidelity, or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up
in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into
our DNA, according to this vision. Right? What Cacilda and I have argued is that no, this economic relationship, this oppositional relationship, is actually an artifact of agriculture, which only arose about 10,000
years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, so we're talking about five percent, at most, of our time as a modern, distinct species. So before agriculture, before the agricultural revolution, it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things, they demand that things be shared: meat, shelter, protection, all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity, it turns out, are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages, and I'm not saying modern day hunter-gatherers
are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument
about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend
this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved, until agriculture, as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at, and that's why our species has survived so well. 04:14Now, this makes some people uncomfortable, and so I always need to take 
a moment in these talks to say, listen, I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous, but I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right? In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying, yes, there were
overlapping sexual relationships, that our ancestors probably had
several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the
people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was
no pair-bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. 04:54And those of us who have
chosen to be monogamous -- my parents, for example, have been married for 52 years monogamously, and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad, I don't want to hear about it— I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors
were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian, but don't think that just because
you've made that decision, bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay? So this is my point. (Laughter) That one took a minute to sink in, huh? 05:43Now, in addition to being a great genius, a wonderful man, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father, Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude. All right? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates, including chimps and bonobos, because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would
the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing
is forming their pair bond, right? Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this, but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent, roughly, of their menstrual cycle, bonobos 90 percent, and humans are among the
only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle, whether she's menstruating,
whether she's post-menopausal, whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now, Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day, as scientists tend to do sometimes. 07:02So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate
has about 300 million sperm cells, so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are 
competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the
female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you, I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes, the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon, who are more typical of mammals, having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only 
animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive. (Laughter) And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles, which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human, some of you will be happy to hear, has the largest, thickest penis of any primate. 08:38Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed
about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo
from southwestern China. In their society, everyone, men and women, are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant, the child is cared for by her, 
her sisters, and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon, we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe -- and they have no contact among them, no common language or anything, so it's not an idea that spread, it's an idea that's arisen around the world -- they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy, the funny guy and the strong guy, to get the essence of each of
these men into the baby, and then when the child is born, these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. 10:05Now, why does this matter? Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate, updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves, for each other, greater respect for unconventional
relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions, and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate, instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. (Applause) Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right? And when we do come out of those closets, we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other, our fight is with an outdated, 
Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights, generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus, because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. 11:43Thank you. 11:45(Applause) 11:54Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Christopher Ryan: Thank you. 11:57CA: So a question. It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say, look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons, and if you look at lots of societies around the world, you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism, but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave? 12:32CR: Well first of all, the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that 
way now, and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on
McDonald's and milkshakes, but your body will rebel against 
that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said, a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people, there's something wrong with you, there's something wrong with your marriage, something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false
vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. 13:39CA: Thank you. Communicated
powerfully. Thanks a lot. 13:41CR: Thank you, Chris.

that you wrote a handwritten note? It's probably been a while. 00:04[The Way We Work] 00:08Technology has changed
the way we communicate. We send emails, not letters, text messages, not phone calls. We order delivery instead of
cooking dinners in our kitchen. All in the name of efficiency. But here's the point. Technology has made it
easier to communicate. But it hasn't made it easier to connect with other human beings. 00:25I've found that the secret to connecting in the high-tech, fast-paced
world that we live in, is doing a few small things
the old-fashioned way. 00:34Write a letter. I've written thousands
of handwritten notes. Thanking people for advice,
thanking them for an interview. It just puts that extra effort
to show someone that you really care and that you're willing
to go above and beyond. Some advice for writing a thank-you letter
is to really make it clear to the person that you're writing to the impact that they
have had on your life. Talk about something specific. Like ""Thank you
for the advice that you gave me. It's because of the advice you gave me,
that I am now doing x."" People are looking to make a difference. And so if you can show someone
that they've really had an impact on the life that you're living,
the life you're pursuing, it could have a huge impact. 01:10Pick up the phone and dial. We've hired thousands of employees. And I've personally called
every single one of them to welcome them to the Compass family. I'm able to set the tone
of really what I want the company to be. Where, you know,
people go above and beyond to make people feel welcomed
and to give people a sense of belonging. And sometimes I call people
on their last day of work. When people leave,
sometimes they're more transparent than they ever were when they
were still at the company. And so it's a great opportunity
to get feedback that is very hard to get otherwise. 01:39Ask interesting and meaningful questions
when you get outside of the office. When I'm traveling the country, every night I'll have dinner
with people in the company. And I like to ask questions like
""What's your underlying motivation? What's something that's happened
this week that meant a lot to you?"" And when you go around the table, and people really open up
and are able to engage, it sets a different tone. When people come back to the office, they can see each other
and they know each other in a deeper way. 02:04Answer questions with honesty. You know how it feels
when you go into an elevator and someone says, ""How was your weekend?"" It could've been the best weekend ever,
you could've met the love of your life, and you would say, ""Good, how was yours?"" If you want to connect with people,
then you have to open up. I'm not always that good at it,
and I imagine most people aren't. But that's why being open
stands out so much, because most people aren't. 02:26Turn the video on. I would always recommend
a videoconference over a phone call. Because that's when you can see
the real personality come out. When you're on video,
you're forced to be present. It's almost a forcing mechanism
to be in the moment. 02:38Nobody succeeds alone. The more you can take time to develop genuine,
authentic relationships, the more you're going to be able
to realize your dreams. You're going to be able to take big risks
and know that there's a network of people to cheer you on
and to support your efforts."

that something else is in play -- that can be disruptive. 00:53Question two: Should I date my boss? In almost all cases, no,
you should not date your boss, because now, you've got a power dynamic. When there's a relationship
between a boss and a subordinate, it generates a lot of negative feelings, and the negative feelings
tend to fall on the person who's lower on the totem pole. People usually assume
some kind of favoritism, some kind of inside knowledge, and there can be resentment
stirred up by that. There was a study published last year that suggested dating a superior can even
have a negative impact on your career. The researchers asked
third-party evaluators online to imagine that they worked at a law firm. They asked them to make recommendations
on which employee should get picked for a special training program and which should get promoted to partner. They looked at credentials
for imaginary employees, and when it was stated
that an employee had been dating or was in a relationship with a superior, the evaluators were less likely to pick
that person for the training program or the promotion, even if they had the exact
same credentials as someone who wasn't dating their boss. The evaluators were also quick
to dismiss their accomplishments. 02:00Question three: Can I date someone who reports to me? Still a big no. You may not feel like
you're really the boss, right? But you are, and there's
a power dynamic there that's simply not there for other couples. If you really believe there is a sincere,
honestly felt, personal connection that would be lasting and meaningful, one of you may need to move, and it shouldn't always be the person
who's lower in the company pecking order. 02:29Question four: I've just started seeing a coworker. How do we handle things? I get this question a lot. ""Are they dating? Are they not dating?"" Don't keep it a secret. You don't have to make a big deal of it,
but secrecy tends to be corrosive. People tend to see workplace couples
as a coalition or a unit, so try to make it clear to your coworkers
that you're not the same person; you love each other,
but you are going to disagree. 02:53Question five: Why are coworkers
often attracted to each other? Well, the obvious answer is people
tend to be attracted to each other the more time they spend together. But there's another ingredient
that has to be added: attraction tends to happen when there's work that demands
close collaboration. So imagine you have a big group project
with a tight deadline and you're working late nights
and brainstorming ideas. You look up, and across the table, one of your colleagues throws out
a really great idea. You may feel something,
and that's natural. We call this task interdependence. It's a ripe ground for attraction. The second reason why people at work
are attracted to each other is they may often be
similar to each other. There's two old adages: ""Birds of a feather flock together.""
And ""Opposites attract."" Well, the psychological
research suggests ... birds of a feather flock together, and we like people who are like us. 03:48Question six: My coworkers are flirting. I'm annoyed. What do I do? Some researchers argue
that for people flirting at work, flirting is good and it boosts creativity. But my own research suggests
things are different for people who are watching
or who are subjected to the flirting. It can be awkward, right? Witnessing flirtation in the workplace
creates a sense of not knowing the rules, not knowing what's going on, or maybe seeing something
that you shouldn't be seeing. People who frequently witness
flirting at work -- they actually report feeling
less satisfied in their jobs, and they feel less valued
by their company. They're more likely to give a negative
appraisal of the work environment, and they may even consider leaving. For women, this association
can be even stronger. This appears to be the case even when people report
not being bothered by the flirting. It's true even when they say
they enjoy it. So, a flirtatious environment
really could be toxic. 04:44Question seven: Do I need a policy
on workplace relationships? You certainly need a policy
on a sexual harassment, and I think most HR departments
recognize that. But for the kind of consensual
behavior we've been talking about, it's a little different. As much as people in HR
would love to wave a magic wand and say, ""Thou shall not
fall in love at work,"" it's just not realistic. Emotional connection
and sexuality is who we are. I kind of want you
to flip the script a little bit. I encourage HR
to really think more broadly about their role in not necessarily
stamping out office romance, because I don't think that's realistic, but how do I help create
a workplace climate and culture where people feel respected
for their individual contributions, not for their appearance or their gender, or their personal relationships? So the larger question is, how do you make sure
people are valued and respected?"
1,How to avoid catching prickly emotions from other people,Jessica Garza,Jan 2021,"Difficult emotions can get under your skin if you're not careful. Sport and performance consultant Jessica Garza calls this the ""jumping cholla effect,"" inspired by a sneaky kind of cactus that detaches and burrows its spines into unsuspecting passersby. In this empowering talk, she shares four mood-regulating strategies to help you gain self-awareness of your feelings, avoid catching other people's emotions and perform at your peak -- whatever the prickly situation may be.", (54K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:00So I'm a sports
and performance psychologist, which means I get to work
with a lot of people like elite athletes, military professionals and top government agencies, whose career and safety
depend on peak performance. And I'll never forget
this one story a soldier told me about his time serving in Iraq. It was around the early 2000s when the United States had military
operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And during this time, many locals were encouraged
to come forward and share information
about potential threats. So one day this Iraqi man
approaches the gate of a US outpost to share intelligence
about a possible threat. But instead of being treated like an ally, he was met with hostility
by the soldier who was debriefing him. But that's likely because
just days earlier, soldiers from another unit
were killed in a surprise attack. And so as the interview continued,
so did the soldier's irritation. And as a result,
the Iraqi man became frustrated. In the end, tempers were flaring so high
that the interview was cut short, and the following day, two separate units were hit
by roadside bombs. 01:05Of course we'll never know for sure
if the attacks could have been stopped had the interview gone differently, but the reason why
I'm telling you this story is because it's an excellent example
of a supercommon problem that keeps so many of us
from performing at our best. And it's how well we're able
to regulate our emotions, which is one of the most common
drivers of a good and bad performance. And it turns out how well you're able
to regulate your emotions depends on how susceptible you are
to a principle called emotional contagion. 01:36It's just like it sounds. It's how quickly you can catch
the emotions of other people and then take them on as your own. The problem is though, most of us are highly susceptible
to other people's emotions, which means even the smallest
external factor can impact how we perform at work, on the field, and even at home. But lucky for us, we can learn how to avoid
other people's emotions by becoming better at regulating our own. 02:05So here's how I like to think about this. Take a look. Now at a glance, this looks like a giant,
teddy bear-looking shrub, right? I remember seeing one of these
for the very first time while hiking in Arizona, and because it looked soft, I reached out to touch it. But by the time my hand was close enough, the spines on the branches
jumped and pricked me -- literally, my hand was covered. And every time I tried to remove one, that little sucker would break off and it would burrow deeper into my skin, just like the guy in the video. 02:35(Video) Man: Argh! 02:37Jessica Garza: And this plant -- 
it has the perfect name. It's called the jumping cholla, and it left a lasting impression -- figuratively and literally. So much so that when I teach people
how to regulate their emotions and avoid catching
the emotions of other people, I refer to the ""jumping cholla effect."" And over the years, I have concluded that the jumping chollas
are just like people. They can be pricks, and if you're not careful,
they can borrow deep into your skin. 03:09So to understand
how this happens in real life, I think it's helpful to know
what emotions actually are. And there's two popular theories
about where emotions come from. The first theory is called
cognitive appraisal, which basically says that the experience of an emotion
is actually you evaluating if your current situation
aligns with your goals or expectations. So let's say you're on your way home
to share some exciting news with your significant other. You walk through the door,
you find them sitting on the couch, but instead of a hello
or ""how was your day?"" they leave the room without saying a word. Now, that's not how you expected
your evening to go, which could lead to the emotion
of feeling annoyed. Does that make sense? 03:52The other theory is called
physiological perception, which is all about the emotions
we subconsciously assign to the physical changes in our body. Public speaking is a great way
to understand this. How perfect, right? Usually, right before I speak
I get butterflies in my stomach. Now, if I had that same physical feeling
the last time I spoke in public and the speech went well, I may interpret that situation
or that sensation as the emotion of excitement. But let's just say
I bombed my last speech. I may now interpret that butterfly feeling
as nervousness or fear. Basically, we overlay
our physiological perception from our past experiences onto our current situation. And what's interesting
is that both of these theories also play into how we assess
the emotions of other people. Because the part of the brain
that processes emotion and memory -- the limbic system -- is considered to be an open-loop system, which means it can be influenced
by any external factor. 04:58Think about it: have you ever passed by someone, and without saying a word, you could feel how annoyed
or how excited they were? And then maybe you felt
annoyed or excited too. It's an interesting
concept to think about, because our brains are hardwired to pick up these subtle cues
in our environment, which makes it possible
for the other person's emotions to jump and attach to you. But what many people don't realize is that every human being
is affected by our open-loop system. Many people at work
or many people on the same team inevitably catch feelings
from one another, sharing everything from jealousy
to envy and worry to joy. The more cohesive the group,
the stronger the sharing of moods. 05:39And we see this play out
in sports all the time. And sometimes even in a good way, like if the team is getting beat but the captain regulates
his or her emotions and stays grounded and present, that can increase the likelihood that the rest of the team
will stay grounded and present as well -- which is great when it happens, but all it takes is for one person
on that team to express a negative emotion for the whole thing to fall apart. Now take a moment and think about
how long you've held onto an irritation, especially after an encounter
from a prickly person. Was it days? Weeks? Months? Man, I had this one boss, who I let his negative emotions
jump and attach to me. And I held onto them for a year -- literally a year. And when I think back now, I can't help but cringe
because of all the productivity lost and the amount of stress that I felt all because my boss and I
caught each other's frustrations and couldn't escape the cycle
of the jumping cholla effect. 06:43But the ideal situation, which improves team and group dynamics
as well as individual happiness, is for everyone to control
their emotional state by sending back the other person's
emotions to them. And research shows that there's two
common emotion regulation strategies that can help. And I use both of these
with my clients all the time. Do you remember cognitive appraisal where you assign meaning to a situation
based on your goals and expectations? Well, the first strategy is called
cognitive reappraisal, where you work to reframe
how you interpret the situation in order to regulate your emotions. It's like taking active steps
to reevaluate your hiking path in order to avoid the jumping cholla. 07:26Let me give you an example. So I once had this soldier who was training
to become an interrogator. And every time he got feedback,
he immediately became defensive and then would justify his behavior. Eventually he told me
that he acted that way because he thought his instructor
just didn't like him. So with the use of cognitive reappraisal, he was taught to actively pause
and reframe his interpretation and expectation of the situation. So if he thought ""my instructor hates me, he always looks upset,"" he would reframe that thought to ""he may look upset but he takes the time
to walk me through what I need to fix."" Now training your brain
to reframe takes time, and sometimes it's not easy because there's a hint of truth
within each of our thoughts. But if you work consistently on reframing, you'll be able to engage prickly people
without being negatively affected by the other person's mood. 08:23Acceptance is the other
emotion regulation strategy. It means what you think. It's learning to accept
a moment for what it is and not for what you want it to be. And when I teach people how to do this,
I use a three-step framework: ""OK; so what; now what."" By saying ""OK,"" you halt
any additional judgment to the person or to the situation. You then allow yourself space
to accept your physiological responses and your perception to what's happening. And once you've distanced yourself
from your thoughts and your emotional state, then you can say, ""so what"" because this helps acknowledge
what happened purely as an event. And as you transition into ""now what"" that means that you've gathered
enough information to be able to respond to the event. Now most people can get to ""OK,"" but struggle to get past ""so what""
because it can be difficult to detach our physiological
perception from the situation. But here's what I tell
people to keep in mind. Acceptance doesn't mean
that you're OK with what happened or that you even want it to continue. It means that you're able to take
an aerial shot of the exchange and understand
where the prickly spines are and if they're worth attaching to. 09:41Now, both of these strategies
are my favorite because they're so powerful, especially on the effects that they have
on how we approach life and relationships. And one study even suggests that cognitive reappraisal
tends to be associated with more immediate emotional relief
in negative situations, whereas acceptance may be better suited for decreasing short-term physiological
reactions in unpleasant situations. But the best part? Both of these strategies
don't have to be separate practices. Acceptance and cognitive reappraisal
can be used interchangeably in order to maintain
emotional self-control. The key though to implementing them
is to become self-aware when you become emotionally
triggered by another person or event. And once you've consciously become aware
of either your thoughts, emotions or physical sensations, well then you can practice
either technique. These may be common concepts, but I'll tell you they're definitely
not commonly practiced. So by remembering
the jumping cholla effect, it will help you to be more
self-aware and self-regulated. And in turn, well,
you'll avoid getting pricked by ... a prick. 10:53Thank you."
2,How to have constructive conversations,Julia Dhar,Mar 2021,"""We need to figure out how we go into conversations not looking for the victory, but the progress,"" says world debate champion Julia Dhar. In this practical talk, she shares three essential features of productive disagreements grounded in curiosity and purpose. The end result? Constructive conversations that sharpen your argument and strengthen your relationships.", (79K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisLietuvių kalbaMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語00:00Three planes, 25 hours, 10,000 miles. My dad gets off a flight from Australia
with one thing in mind and it's not a snack or a shower or a nap. It's November 2016 and Dad is here to talk to Americans
about the election. Now, Dad's a news fiend, but for him, this is not just red or blue,
swing states or party platforms. He has some really specific intentions. He wants to listen,
be heard and understand. 00:31And over two weeks,
he has hundreds of conversations with Americans from
New Hampshire to Miami. Some of them are tough conversations, complete differences of opinions, wildly different worldviews, radically opposite life experiences. But in all of those interactions, Dad walks away
with a big smile on his face and so does the other person. You can see one of them here. And in those interactions, he's having a version
of what it seems like we have less of, but want more of -- a constructive conversation. 01:09We have more ways than ever to connect. And yet, politically, ideologically, it feels like we are further
and further apart. We tell pollsters that we want
politicians who are open-minded. And yet when they change
their point of view, we say that they lacked conviction. For us, when we're confronted
with information that challenges an existing worldview, our tendency is not to open up,
it's to double down. We even have a term for it
in social psychology. It's called belief perseverance. And boy, do some people's beliefs
seem to persevere. 01:50I'm no stranger to tough conversations. I got my start in what I now call
productive disagreement in high school debate. I even went on to win the World Schools Debate
Championship three times. I've been in a lot of arguments,
is what I'm saying, but it took watching my dad
on the streets of the US to understand
that we need to figure out how we go into conversations. Not looking for the victory,
but the progress. 02:19And so since November 2016,
that's what I've been doing. Working with governments,
foundations, corporations, families, to uncover the tools and techniques that allow us to talk when it feels
like the divide is unbridgeable. And constructive conversations
that really move the dialogue forward have these same three essential features. 02:43First, at least one party
in the conversation is willing to choose curiosity over clash. They're open to the idea
that the discussion is a climbing wall, not a cage fight, that they'll make progress over time and are able to anchor all of that
in purpose of the discussion. For someone trained in formal debate, it is so tempting to run headlong
at the disagreement. In fact, we call that clash and in formal argumentation, it's a punishable offense
if there's not enough of it. But I've noticed,
you've probably noticed, too, that in real life that tends
to make people shut down, not just from the conversation, but even from the relationship. It's actually one of the causes
of unfriending, online and off. 03:40So instead, you might consider a technique made popular by the Hollywood
producer Brian Grazer, the curiosity conversation. And the whole point
of a curiosity conversation is to understand
the other person's perspective, to see what's on their side of the fence. And so the next time that someone says something
you instinctively disagree with, that you react violently to, you only need one sentence
and one question: “I never thought about it
exactly that way before. What can you share
that would help me see what you see?” What's remarkable
about curiosity conversations is that the people you are curious about
tend to become curious about you. Whether it's a friendly
Australian gentleman, a political foe or a corporate rival, they begin to wonder
what it is that you see and whether they could see it to. 04:42Constructive conversations
aren't a one-shot deal. If you go into an encounter
expecting everyone to walk out with the same point of view
that you walked in with, there's really no chance for progress. Instead, we need to think
about conversations as a climbing wall to do a variant of what
my dad did during this trip, pocketing a little nugget
of information here, adapting his approach there. That's actually a technique
borrowed from formal debate where you present an idea, it's attacked and you adapt
and re-explain, it's attacked again, you adapt and re-explain. The whole expectation
is that your idea gets better through challenge and criticism. 05:31And the evidence from really high-stakes
international negotiations suggests that that's what successful
negotiators do as well. They go into conversations expecting to learn from the challenges
that they will receive to use objections to make their ideas
and proposals better. Development is in some way a service
that we can do for others and that others can do for us. It makes the ideas sharper, but the relationships warmer. Curiosity can be relationship magic and development can be
rocket fuel for your ideas. 06:12But there are some situations where it just feels
like it's not worth the bother. And in those cases it can be because the purpose
of the discussion isn't clear. I think back to how my dad
went into those conversations with a really clear sense of purpose. He was there to learn, to listen,
to share his point of view. And once that purpose
is understood by both parties, then you can begin to move on. Lay out our vision for the future. Make a decision. Get funding. Then you can move on to principles. 06:52When people shared with my dad
their hopes for America, that's where they started
with the big picture, not with personality
or politics or policies. Because inadvertently
they were doing something that we do naturally with outsiders and find it really difficult sometimes
to do with insiders. They painted in broad strokes before digging into the details. 07:24But maybe you live in the same
zip code or the same house and it feels like none
of that common ground is there today. Then you might consider a version
of disagreement time travel, asking your counterpart to articulate
what kind of neighborhood, country, world, community, they want a year from now, a decade from now. It is very tempting
to dwell in present tensions and get bogged down in practicalities. Inviting people to inhabit
a future possibility opens up the chance
of a conversation with purpose. 08:06Earlier in my career, I worked for the deputy
prime minister of New Zealand who practiced a version of this technique. New Zealand's electoral system
is designed for unlikely friendships, coalitions, alliances, memoranda of understanding
are almost inevitable. And this particular government set-up
had some of almost everything -- small government conservatives, liberals, the Indigenous people's party,
the Green Party. And I recently asked him, what does it take to bring
a group like that together but hold them together? He said, ""Someone, you,
has to take responsibility for reminding them
of their shared purpose: caring for people.” If we are more focused
on what makes us different than the same, then every debate is a fight. If we put our challenges
and our problems before us, then every potential ally
becomes an adversary. 09:11But as my dad packed his bags
for the three flights, 25 hours, 10,000 miles back to Australia, he was also packing a collection
of new perspectives, a new way of navigating conversations, and a whole set of new stories
and experiences to share. But he was also leaving those behind with everyone that he'd interacted with. We love unlikely friendships
when they look like this. We've just forgotten how to make them. And amid the cacophony of cable news and the awkwardness of family dinners, and the hostility of corporate meetings, each of us has this -- the opportunity
to walk into every encounter, like my dad walked off that plane, to choose curiosity over clash, to expect development
of your ideas through discussion and to anchor in common purpose. That's what really
world-class persuaders do to build constructive conversations and move them forward. It's how our world will move forward too. 10:25Thank you."

with Difficult Feelings. I’m your host, Cloe Shasha Brooks,
and a curator at TED. This past year has been full
of both personal and collective grief. And this grief has taken many forms. And to dive deeper into the world
of understanding and managing grief, I'll be speaking first
with Nina Westbrook, a marriage and family therapist
who has supported clients through loss. Hi, Nina. 00:34Nina Westbrook: Hi, Cloe,
good to see you. Thank you so much for having me. 00:39CSB: Thanks for joining us. Nina, you have talked about how grief
can be about the loss of people and tangible things. But that it can also be
about the loss of dreams, something that many people
have experienced over the past year. Can you give me some examples
of grieving for lost dreams and talk about what it means
to experience this kind of grief? 00:59NW: Absolutely. I believe that grief can take
so many different forms, and I think oftentimes
when we think about grief, we associate it with the emotional process that takes place when we're coping
with the death of a loved one. I don't know. It's just not as common to associate grief or correlate grief
with the loss of a dream. So when you think about dreams
and when they begin and how deeply they're rooted
into our daily lives and our routines and how much our dreams determine our decision-making process and the choices that we make
throughout the course of our lives, they hold a pretty significant
amount of space in our minds and in our hearts. Imagine a child who, you know, from a young age,
we begin to dream and they begin to dream
about becoming an astronaut one day and walking on the moon
or becoming a professional athlete. And then as we grow older, we begin to focus in
on what our needs are and what our wants are, and our dreams begin to look more
like acquiring our dream careers or job positions or opening businesses, having children or finding love. And the reality is that these dreams
do not always work out and manifest themselves in a way
that we have imagined, right? And that can be so devastating
for so many people. The loss of careers and jobs or our divorces,
the loss of relationships, or infertility can all be
extremely devastating things and those types of devastating events propel you into the emotional process that takes place during grief. 02:59CSB: Let's bring a question up
from the audience. What are comforting things to do
or say when someone is grieving? So I guess someone else in this case. 03:07NW: That's a really amazing question. A lot of the time, simply being present and offering support and encouragement is really going to be important when you're trying to support
someone else through their grief. I think communication is also important, asking that person, ""What can I do,"" or ""What do you need
from me in this moment and how can I best support you,"" is kind of going to be the best way
to figure out how to support this person. Sometimes they just want
someone to listen to. Sometimes they need someone
to make them laugh or to help, you know, keep them distracted for a moment or sometimes they just need someone
to be around them. It just really depends on the person, since grief is so subjective
in the way that we go through it. 04:01CSB: Totally. And let's go right
into some strategies, too. So I'm sure you have strategies
for managing the grief of lost dreams. How do people pick themselves
back up after that? 04:13NW: You want to give yourself
permission to grieve, first off. And it's not a linear journey, there is going to be lots of ups
and downs that take place. Some days you're going to be OK
and some days you might cry and sometimes you might go
a month without crying. And then one day everything comes
crashing down all at once. It's just a matter of giving yourself
permission to go through these feelings and knowing and reassuring yourself
that this is OK and it's normal. And also keeping in mind that it's OK to feel joy
even in those moments of sadness that you're going to experience
when you're grieving. The other thing that I think
is really important is just to be proactive
in the grieving process. Don't ignore your grief. You can seek support. You can't be afraid to ask for support or lean on others, people that you trust, friends, family members, coworkers,
whomever it may be for support. And then making a plan, making a new plan. Mourning happens over time. What it's doing, what we're doing, and all of the emotions
that were going through during that mourning process is we're literally detaching ourselves
emotionally from the dream that we are mourning or from the object that we're mourning. And what that's doing
is opening yourself up and making space for new dreams and new experiences
and new opportunities in the future. So goal setting and planning
is going to be key. A lot of the time
we really focus on plan A. So this is a great time to pivot and focus on planning
for a new future and a new outcome. 06:08CSB: Absolutely. And just one final quick question for you, which is that sometimes people
get mad at themselves for not getting over their grief. What would you say to those people? 06:18NW: It's really important to keep healing
at the forefront of your mind. And I think that understanding
the grief process and going through the ups and downs and knowing that that's all a part of it, you have to be patient with yourself, you have to give yourself grace and understand that you're
going to have good days, you're going to have bad days. But when it all comes down to it, if you're keeping the idea
of healing in the forefront, then you can focus your energy
and your time into that process and going through it in a way
that is productive to your emotional well-being
in the future. 06:59CSB: Wonderful. Well, thank you so much
for this conversation, Nina. We have come to the end, but really grateful to you for joining us. Take care. 07:07NW: Thank you so much
for having me. Take care."

And why do happy people cheat? And when we say ""infidelity,""
what exactly do we mean? Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room, a massage with a happy ending? Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy, but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy? And is an affair always
the end of a relationship? 00:41For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple
of their relationship, their happiness and their
very identity: an affair. And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved. 01:17Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented, and so, too, the taboo against it. In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy, so much so, that this is
the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible: once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it. (Laughter) So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden, yet universally practiced? 01:53Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat with little consequence, and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam, so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself. But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right? Because when it comes to sex, the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate, but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny, which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. 02:37Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time. (Laughter) (Applause) 02:52I mean, many of you probably have said, ""I am monogamous in all my relationships."" (Laughter) 03:00We used to marry, and had sex for the first time. But now we marry, and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love. Men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are, and who gets the cows when I die. 03:24Now, everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference. (Laughter) It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding: sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps. So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity, estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent. But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions. So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie
about having an affair, but just about the same
amount of us will say that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one. (Laughter) 04:19Now, I like this definition
of an affair -- it brings together the three key elements: a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair; an emotional connection
to one degree or another; and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here, because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving, can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said, it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person. 05:05So it's never been easier to cheat, and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened
our economic security. But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens
our emotional security. Ironically, we used to turn to adultery -- that was the space where
we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it. 05:46Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs: to be my greatest lover, my best friend, the best parent, my trusted confidant, my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal. And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique, I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable, I'm the one. And infidelity tells me I'm not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love. But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful, today it is often traumatic, because it threatens our sense of self. 06:45So my patient Fernando, he's plagued. He goes on: ""I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was. Now, I question everything."" Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity. ""Can I ever trust you again?"" he asks. ""Can I ever trust anyone again?"" 07:08And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me, when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick. Married, two kids. Nick just left on a business trip, and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys, when she sees a message
appear on the screen: ""Can't wait to see you."" Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other. And then another message: ""Can't wait to hold you in my arms."" And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me
that her father had affairs, but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket, and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar. Heather, she goes digging, and she finds hundreds of messages, and photos exchanged
and desires expressed. The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair unfold in front of her in real time, And it made me think: Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts. 08:15But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal, we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never
been more inclined to stray, and not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires, because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy, today we divorce
because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today, choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather, she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick, and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice: Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. 09:23So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats, either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people
can't all be pathological. The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home, then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere, assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion
has a finite shelf life? What if there are things
that even a good relationship can never provide? If even happy people cheat, what is it about? 10:16The vast majority of people
that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs, and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades, but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross, and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what? Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression
of longing and loss. At the heart of an affair,
you will often find a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy. 11:22I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya, who is blissfully married, loves her husband, and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she's always done
what was expected of her: good girl, good wife, good mother, taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her. But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another, it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from, but the person that
we have ourselves become. And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person, as much as we are
looking for another self. 12:27Now, all over the world, there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses -- of a parent who died, and a friend that went too soon, and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair, because they raise these questions. Is this it? Is there more? Am I going on for another
25 years like this? Will I ever feel that thing again? And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel
people to cross the line, and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness, in an antidote to death. 13:21And contrary to what you may think, affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire: desire for attention,
desire to feel special, desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair, the fact that you can
never have your lover, keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine, because the incompleteness, the ambiguity, keeps you wanting
that which you can't have. 13:53Now some of you probably think that affairs don't happen
in open relationships, but they do. First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners, we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden, that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do, then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to. And I've also told
quite a few of my patients that if they could bring
into their relationships one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs, they probably would never need to see me. (Laughter) 14:44So how do we heal from an affair? Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were
already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us
into new possibilities. The fact is, the majority of couples who have experienced
affairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive, and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity. They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience. And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner, who will often say, ""You think I didn't want more? But I'm not the one who did it."" But now that the affair is exposed, they, too, get to claim more, and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo that may not have been working
for them that well, either. 15:44I've noticed that a lot of couples, in the immediate aftermath of an affair, because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order, will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. And, partners who were
sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious, they don't know where it's coming from. Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire, and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth. 16:18So when an affair is exposed, what are some of the specific things
that couples can do? We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair, for Nick, one thing is to end the affair, but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner, but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship. He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries. It's his responsibility to bring it up, because if he thinks about it, he can relieve Heather from the obsession, and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten, and that in itself
begins to restore trust. 17:27But for Heather, or deceived partners, it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth, to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities that give back joy
and meaning and identity. But even more important, is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details -- Where were you? Where did you do it? How often? Is she better
than me in bed? -- questions that only inflict more pain, and keep you awake at night. And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions, the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives -- What did this affair mean for you? What were you able to express
or experience there that you could no longer do with me? What was it like for you
when you came home? What is it about us that you value? Are you pleased this is over? 18:26Every affair will redefine a relationship, and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire, they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad, and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms. There are many ways
that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner. In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. 19:17Now, you've listened to me, and I know what you're thinking: She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair. (Laughter) So, you're wrong. I am not French. (Laughter) (Applause) And I'm not pro-affair. But because I think that good
can come out of an affair, I have often been asked
this very strange question: Would I ever recommend it? Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer, and yet we know that people
who have been ill often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against? I said, ""Yes."" (Laughter) 20:21I look at affairs from a dual perspective: hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other -- what it did to you,
and what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed, I will often tell them this: Today in the West, most of us are going to have
two or three relationships or marriages, and some of us are going
to do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create
a second one together? 21:05Thank you. 21:06(Applause)"
1,The emotions behind your money habits,Robert A. Belle,Jun 2021,"Your money habits reveal a lot about you: your hopes, fears, dreams and other deep personal truths you may not even be aware of, says accountant Robert A. Belle. He shares how taking stock of your transaction history can unlock surprisingly valuable insights about what drives you to spend (and save) -- and provides practical tips on how to perform an ""emotional audit"" of your expenses.", (62K),"Transcript (18 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuCatalàEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01I am an accountant with a numbers problem. I mean, I'm good with numbers
and using them to report what's happening, but I'm also concerned
with the full story behind those numbers, the part that gets lost in translation, the part that numbers can't quite tell, the story that goes deeper than mere strategies
for saving and earning money. And without that story,
I don't think I'm doing my job well. That's why I've dedicated my career to figuring out how my work
as an accountant can tell stories about people, stories that will ultimately
help them improve their lives. Let me explain. 00:42It all started when someone told me,
""You're obsessed with chocolate."" And I was like, ""What? No, I'm not."" But then I wondered, could I be
in denial about my own obsession? Was I actually spending a lot of money
on chocolate but blind to it? Well, here was a chance
for me to test this theory. Using my accountant lens, off I went tracking
my spending on chocolate -- and there it was, my love for chocolate. I was spending about 50 dollars
a month on chocolate, especially in months
when I was overstressed and months when I was overjoyed. 01:20Analyzing my expenses
helped me to understand that I had an emotional pattern
where when I'm struggling or celebrating, I binge on chocolate. I had struggled with my weight
for a very long time and I was convinced
that my diet was not the problem. I was convinced that it was
my lack of effort in exercise, and certainly not chocolate. Tracking my spending on chocolate, though, helped me realize that I was afraid
of facing myself in the mirror, literally and figuratively, and that I lack the courage
to deal with the real problem, my diet. So I continued to exercise, but devoted less time to it and instead shifted my focus and energy
towards developing a more healthful diet. That year I lost 50 pounds. 02:14Our relationship with money
represents our relationship with life. The accounting
of my own chocolate behavior told me the story of my own denial. I realized that perhaps
I could also help my clients see what they were overlooking
in their own lives and help them realize
their own emotional patterns through their tracking and spending
of their expenses. 02:40So I started to pay close attention
to the story behind my clients' expenses that may be hidden to them. One of my clients, a critical care nurse, was convinced that
her personal budget was reasonable and expenses justifiable. She had struggled to build up her savings and I noticed that she had
minimal records of her expenses. I suggested to her
that her lack of savings could be due to more
than just a gap in her financial knowledge and offered to help identify the problem. I encouraged her to start tracking
and charting her expenses. After a few months,
her financial records revealed that most of her spending
was on expensive clothing and shoes. As we sat together,
she was genuinely surprised to see just how much of her budget
was going towards fashion. She remarked, ""Wow, these are
impulsive purchases, aren't they? I guess I didn't realize that."" 03:42She analyzed further
and realized that she was buying clothes in an attempt to impress
and appear successful to her friends. And also when her confidence was low,
buying clothes temporarily boosted it. She told me that buying clothing
was her attempt to find meaning in life and feel valued. She sighed, and she set a goal
for herself and her finances. Six months later, she called me
to tell me she had saved a bunch of money by reducing her spending on shopping and instead choosing to exercise
when she felt the urge to shop. She's much happier around her friends. Three years later,
home ownership is on the horizon. 04:29Sometimes, though, charting expenses
may not reveal something specific, as a chocolate addiction
or shopping problem, but what it reveals
can be just as valuable. A marketing strategist
and upcoming musician needed help with her taxes. When I met with her, I immediately
took note of the fear in her face as she looked through
her records and expenses. I checked in with her
and she expressed to me that some things in her life
didn't quite seem to work out, including her relationships. She was afraid of facing how much money
she was about to lose after taxes. As we continued talking
about her finances, she started to notice a connection
between her fear of losing money and her fear of losing relationships. She went on to tell me that she was
afraid of committing to anyone because she didn't want to get hurt. She expressed that she had not been
close to anyone in over seven years because she feared failure. And maybe she might have
an avoidance strategy around both her money
and her relationships. 05:42It's been six years since I first
help her chart her finances, and she's still consistently
keeping up with her spreadsheet. As she confronted her personal accounting and grew her savings in advance
of each tax season, she developed less fear of loss
and grew more open to relationships. She tells me that she even has the courage to walk away from a relationship
when it's not serving her. She recently told me, ""My spreadsheet is basically
a story of my life's progression and I can see it through the numbers.” 06:20I believe we can all do this type of audit
of our own financial behavior and that we can learn
surprising things about ourselves through tracking
and charting our expenses. Here's how. Number one, take a look
at your bank statement for the last six months and categorize the expenses by type for a more holistic view. For example, your spending on shopping
versus transport versus entertainment. 06:48Number two, when an expensive
pattern emerges, see what that pattern says about yourself. Be curious and inquisitive. At first, it may not be that obvious, but asking yourself what led you
to make that choice in a given moment can provide some clues. Do you buy pizza every Wednesday night because that's when you're too tired
to cook after a stressful weekly meeting? 07:14Number three, observe
if there are any line items that you are shocked by
in terms of value or volume and see what patterns emerge. For example, did you buy
that new smartphone just before a major function or event so that your friends would notice? Or do you tell yourself
you only take taxis late at night, but then realize that you're taking
way more taxes every month than you thought? Are you working late
more than you thought? 07:44There's so much that we can
learn about ourselves if we take the time to look. And sometimes our money knows us
better than we know ourselves. Tracking our finances
can reveal what we are in denial of, our hidden biases, our fears and what
might be holding us back. Though it can be difficult
and uncomfortable to take a good, hard look
at our financial behavior, it can reveal some deep emotional truths. Some truths that can help us
re-evaluate our careers, our relationships and our priorities. So give it a try.
The payoff could be huge. 08:26Thank you."
1,The journey through loss and grief,Jason B. Rosenthal,Jun 2018,"In her brutally honest, ironically funny and widely read meditation on death, ""You May Want to Marry My Husband,"" the late author and filmmaker Amy Krouse Rosenthal gave her husband Jason very public permission to move on and find happiness. A year after her death, Jason offers candid insights on the often excruciating process of moving through and with loss -- as well as some quiet wisdom for anyone else experiencing life-changing grief.", (72K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeΕλληνικάСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01There are three words
that explain why I am here. They are ""Amy Krouse Rosenthal."" 00:11At the end of Amy's life, hyped up on morphine and home in hospice, the ""New York Times""
published an article she wrote for the ""Modern Love"" column
on March 3, 2017. It was read worldwide
by over five million people. The piece was unbearably sad, ironically funny and brutally honest. While it was certainly
about our life together, the focus of the piece was me. It was called, ""You May
Want to Marry My Husband."" It was a creative play
on a personal ad for me. Amy quite literally left
an empty space for me to fill with another love story. 00:55Amy was my wife for half my life. She was my partner in raising
three wonderful, now grown children, and really, she was my girl, you know? We had so much in common. We loved the same art, the same documentaries, the same music. Music was a huge part
of our life together. And we shared the same values. We were in love, and our love grew stronger
up until her last day. Amy was a prolific author. In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs, she published over 30 children's books. Posthumously, the book she wrote
with our daughter Paris, called ""Dear Girl,"" reached the number one position
on the ""New York Times"" bestseller list. She was a self-described tiny filmmaker. She was 5'1"" and her films
were not that long. 01:48(Laughter) 01:49Her films exemplified her natural ability
to gather people together. She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children
and adults of all ages all over the world. 02:03Now, my story of grief is only unique
in the sense of it being rather public. However, the grieving process itself
was not my story alone. Amy gave me permission to move forward,
and I'm so grateful for that. Now, just a little over a year
into my new life, I've learned a few things. I'm here to share with you
part of the process of moving forward through and with grief. But before I do that,
I think it would be important to talk a little bit
about the end of life, because it forms how I have been
emotionally since then. Death is such a taboo subject, right? 02:42Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017. She somehow lived an additional two months without solid food. Her doctors told us
we could do hospice at home or in the hospital. They did not tell us that Amy
would shrink to half her body weight, that she would never lay
with her husband again, and that walking upstairs to our bedroom
would soon feel like running a marathon. Home hospice does have an aura of being
a beautiful environment to die in. How great that you don't have
the sounds of machines beeping and going on and off all the time, no disruptions for mandatory
drug administration, home with your family to die. 03:30We did our best to make those weeks
as meaningful as we could. We talked often about death. Everybody knows it's going
to happen to them, like, for sure, but being able to talk openly
about it was liberating. We talked about subjects like parenting. I asked Amy how I could be the best parent
possible to our children in her absence. In those conversations,
she gave me confidence by stressing what a great relationship
I had with each one of them, and that I can do it. I know there will be many times where I wish she and I
can make decisions together. We were always so in sync. May I be so audacious as to suggest that you have these conversations now, when healthy. Please don't wait. 04:24As part of our hospice experience,
we organized groups of visitors. How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline. We had a Krouse night, her parents and three siblings. Friends and family were next. Each told beautiful stories
of Amy and of us. Amy made an immense impact
on her loyal friends. 04:48But home hospice is not so beautiful
for the surviving family members. I want to get a little personal here
and tell you that to this date, I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me. I remember walking backwards
to the bathroom, assisting Amy with each step. I felt so strong. I'm not such a big guy, but my arms looked and felt so healthy
compared to Amy's frail body. And that body failed in our house. On March 13 of last year, my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed. I carried her lifeless body down our stairs, through our dining room and our living room to a waiting gurney to have her body cremated. I will never get that image
out of my head. If you know someone who has been
through the hospice experience, acknowledge that. Just say you heard this guy Jason talk about how tough it must be
to have those memories and that you're there
if they ever want to talk about it. They may not want to talk, but it's nice to connect with someone
living each day with those lasting images. I know this sounds unbelievable,
but I've never been asked that question. 06:20Amy's essay caused me
to experience grief in a public way. Many of the readers who reached out to me
wrote beautiful words of reflection. The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer than even us and her family knew. Some of the responses I received helped me
with the intense grieving process because of their humor, like this email I received
from a woman reader who read the article, declaring, ""I will marry you when you are ready -- 06:50(Laughter) 06:51""provided you permanently stop drinking. No other conditions. I promise to outlive you. Thank you very much."" 07:02Now, I do like a good tequila,
but that really is not my issue. Yet how could I say no to that proposal? 07:09(Laughter) 07:11I laughed through the tears when I read
this note from a family friend: ""I remember Shabbat dinners at your home and Amy teaching me
how to make cornbread croutons. Only Amy could find
creativity in croutons."" 07:26(Laughter) 07:30On July 27, just a few months
after Amy's death, my dad died of complications related to a decades-long battle
with Parkinson's disease. I had to wonder: How much
can the human condition handle? What makes us capable
of dealing with this intense loss and yet carry on? Was this a test? Why my family and my amazing children? Looking for answers, I regret to say,
is a lifelong mission, but the key to my being able to persevere is Amy's expressed and very public edict that I must go on. Throughout this year,
I have done just that. I have attempted to step out
and seek the joy and the beauty that I know this life
is capable of providing. But here's the reality: those family gatherings, attending weddings
and events honoring Amy, as loving as they are, have all been very difficult to endure. People say I'm amazing. ""How do you handle yourself
that way during those times?"" They say, ""You do it with such grace."" Well, guess what? I really am sad a lot of the time. I often feel like I'm kind of a mess, and I know these feelings
apply to other surviving spouses, children, parents and other family members. 09:04In Japanese Zen, there is a term ""Shoji,"" which translates as ""birth death."" There is no separation
between life and death other than a thin line
that connects the two. Birth, or the joyous,
wonderful, vital parts of life, and death, those things
we want to get rid of, are said to be faced equally. In this new life that I find myself in, I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving. 09:35In the early months
following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair
would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming. Soon I was fortunate
to receive some promising advice. Many members of the losing-a-spouse club reached out to me. One friend in particular who had also
lost her life partner kept repeating, ""Jason, you will find joy."" I didn't even know
what she was talking about. How was that possible? But because Amy gave me
very public permission to also find happiness, I now have experienced joy
from time to time. There it was, dancing the night away
at an LCD Soundsystem concert, traveling with my brother and best friend
or with a college buddy on a boys' trip to meet a group of great guys
I never met before. From observing that my deck had sun
beating down on it on a cold day, stepping out in it, laying there, the warmth consuming my body. The joy comes from my three
stunning children. There was my son Justin, texting me a picture of himself
with an older gentleman with a massive, strong forearm
and the caption, ""I just met Popeye,"" with a huge grin on his face. 10:59(Laughter) 11:01There was his brother Miles,
walking to the train for his first day of work
after graduating college, who stopped and looked
back at me and asked, ""What am I forgetting?"" I assured him right away,
""You are 100 percent ready. You got this."" And my daughter Paris, walking together
through Battersea Park in London, the leaves piled high, the sun glistening in the early morning
on our way to yoga. 11:28I would add that beauty
is also there to discover, and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety but beauty nonetheless. On the one hand, when I see something
in this category, I want to say, ""Amy, did you see that? Did you hear that? It's too beautiful
for you not to share with me."" On the other hand, I now experience these moments in an entirely new way. There was the beauty I found in music, like the moment in the newest
Manchester Orchestra album, when the song ""The Alien"" seamlessly transitions
into ""The Sunshine,"" or the haunting beauty
of Luke Sital-Singh's ""Killing Me,"" whose chorus reads, ""And it's killing me
that you're not here with me. I'm living happily,
but I'm feeling guilty."" There is beauty in the simple moments
that life has to offer, a way of seeing that world
that was so much a part of Amy's DNA, like on my morning commute, looking at the sun
reflecting off of Lake Michigan, or stopping and truly seeing
how the light shines at different times of the day in the house we built together; even after a Chicago storm,
noticing the fresh buildup of snow throughout the neighborhood; or peeking into my daughter's room as she's practicing the bass guitar. 13:01Listen, I want to make it clear
that I'm a very fortunate person. I have the most amazing family
that loves and supports me. I have the resources for personal growth
during my time of grief. But whether it's a divorce, losing a job you worked so hard at or having a family member die suddenly or of a slow-moving and painful death, I would like to offer you what I was given: a blank of sheet of paper. What will you do
with your intentional empty space, with your fresh start? 13:43Thank you. 13:45(Applause)"
2,The lies our culture tells us about what matters — and a better way to live,David Brooks,Jun 2019,"Our society is in the midst of a social crisis, says op-ed columnist and author David Brooks: we're trapped in a valley of isolation and fragmentation. How do we find our way out? Based on his travels across the United States -- and his meetings with a range of exceptional people known as ""weavers"" -- Brooks lays out his vision for a cultural revolution that empowers us all to lead lives of greater meaning, purpose and joy.", (146K),"Transcript (17 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00So, we all have bad seasons in life. And I had one in 2013. My marriage had just ended, and I was humiliated
by that failed commitment. My kids had left home for college
or were leaving. I grew up mostly
in the conservative movement, but conservatism had changed, so I lost a lot of those friends, too. 00:20And so what I did is,
I lived alone in an apartment, and I just worked. If you opened the kitchen drawers
where there should have been utensils, there were Post-it notes. If you opened the other drawers
where there should have been plates, I had envelopes. I had work friends, weekday friends,
but I didn't have weekend friends. And so my weekends
were these long, howling silences. And I was lonely. And loneliness, unexpectedly,
came to me in the form of -- it felt like fear,
a burning in my stomach. And it felt a little like drunkenness, just making bad decisions,
just fluidity, lack of solidity. And the painful part of that moment
was the awareness that the emptiness in my apartment
was just reflective of the emptiness in myself, and that I had fallen for some of the lies
that our culture tells us. 01:15The first lie is that
career success is fulfilling. I've had a fair bit of career success, and I've found that it helps me avoid
the shame I would feel if I felt myself a failure, but it hasn't given me any positive good. 01:28The second lie is I can make myself happy, that if I just win one more victory, lose 15 pounds, do a little more yoga, I'll get happy. And that's the lie of self-sufficiency. But as anybody
on their deathbed will tell you, the things that make people happy
is the deep relationships of life, the losing of self-sufficiency. 01:51The third lie is the lie
of the meritocracy. The message of the meritocracy
is you are what you accomplish. The myth of the meritocracy
is you can earn dignity by attaching yourself
to prestigious brands. The emotion of the meritocracy
is conditional love, you can ""earn"" your way to love. The anthropology of the meritocracy
is you're not a soul to be purified, you're a set of skills to be maximized. And the evil of the meritocracy is that people who've achieved
a little more than others are actually worth
a little more than others. And so the wages of sin are sin. And my sins were the sins of omission-- not reaching out,
failing to show up for my friends, evasion, avoiding conflict. 02:31And the weird thing was
that as I was falling into the valley -- it was a valley of disconnection -- a lot of other people
were doing that, too. And that's sort of
the secret to my career; a lot of the things that happen to me are always happening
to a lot of other people. I'm a very average person
with above average communication skills. 02:48(Laughter) 02:49footnotefootnoteAnd so I was detached. And at the same time,
a lot of other people were detached and isolated and fragmented
from each other. Thirty-five percent of Americans
over 45 are chronically lonely. Only eight percent of Americans
report having meaningful conversation with their neighbors. Only 32 percent of Americans
say they trust their neighbors, and only 18 percent of millennials. The fastest-growing
political party is unaffiliated. The fastest-growing religious
movement is unaffiliated. Depression rates are rising,
mental health problems are rising. The suicide rate has risen
30 percent since 1999. For teen suicides
over the last several years, the suicide rate has risen by 70 percent. Forty-five thousand Americans
kill themselves every year; 72,000 die from opioid addictions; life expectancy is falling, not rising. 03:36So what I mean to tell you,
I flew out here to say that we have an economic crisis,
we have environmental crisis, we have a political crisis. We also have a social
and relational crisis; we're in the valley. We're fragmented from each other, we've got cascades of lies
coming out of Washington ... We're in the valley. 03:53footnotefootnoteAnd so I've spent the last five years -- how do you get out of a valley? The Greeks used to say,
""You suffer your way to wisdom."" And from that dark period where I started,
I've had a few realizations. The first is, freedom sucks. Economic freedom is OK,
political freedom is great, social freedom sucks. The unrooted man is the adrift man. The unrooted man is the unremembered man,
because he's uncommitted to things. Freedom is not an ocean
you want to swim in, it's a river you want to get across, so you can commit and plant yourself
on the other side. 04:29footnotefootnoteThe second thing I learned is that when you have
one of those bad moments in life, you can either be broken, or you can be broken open. And we all know people who are broken. They've endured some pain
or grief, they get smaller, they get angrier, resentful,
they lash out. As the saying is, ""Pain that is not transformed
gets transmitted."" But other people are broken open. Suffering's great power
is that it's an interruption of life. It reminds you you're not the person
you thought you were. The theologian Paul Tillich said what suffering does is it carves through
what you thought was the floor of the basement of your soul, and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below, and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below. You realize there are depths of yourself
you never anticipated, and only spiritual and relational food
will fill those depths. And when you get down there,
you get out of the head of the ego and you get into the heart, the desiring heart. The idea that what we really yearn for
is longing and love for another, the kind of thing that Louis de Bernières
described in his book, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" He had an old guy talking to his daughter about his relationship with his late wife, and the old guy says, ""Love itself is whatever is leftover
when being in love is burned away. And this is both an art
and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it. We had roots that grew
towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms
had fallen from our branches, we discovered that we are
one tree and not two."" That's what the heart yearns for. 05:55The second thing
you discover is your soul. Now, I don't ask you to believe in God
or not believe in God, but I do ask you to believe
that there's a piece of you that has no shape, size, color or weight, but that gives you
infinite dignity and value. Rich and successful people
don't have more of this than less successful people. Slavery is wrong because
it's an obliteration of another soul. Rape is not just an attack
on a bunch of physical molecules, it's an attempt to insult
another person's soul. And what the soul does
is it yearns for righteousness. The heart yearns for fusion with another,
the soul yearns for righteousness. And that led to my third realization,
which I borrowed from Einstein: ""The problem you have
is not going to be solved at the level of consciousness
on which you created it. You have to expand
to a different level of consciousness."" 06:42footnotefootnoteSo what do you do? Well, the first thing you do
is you throw yourself on your friends and you have deeper conversations
that you ever had before. But the second thing you do, you have to go out alone
into the wilderness. You go out into that place
where there's nobody there to perform, and the ego has nothing to do,
and it crumbles, and only then are you capable
of being loved. I have a friend who said
that when her daughter was born, she realized that she loved her
more than evolution required. 07:09(Laughter) 07:10And I've always loved that. 07:11(Applause) 07:12Because it talks about the peace
that's at the deep of ourself, our inexplicable care for one another. And when you touch that spot,
you're ready to be rescued. The hard thing about
when you're in the valley is that you can't climb out; somebody has to reach in and pull you out. It happened to me. I got, luckily, invited over to a house
by a couple named Kathy and David, and they were -- They had a kid in the DC
public school, his name's Santi. Santi had a friend
who needed a place to stay because his mom had some health issues. And then that kid had a friend
and that kid had a friend. When I went to their house six years ago, I walk in the door, there's like
25 around the kitchen table, a whole bunch sleeping
downstairs in the basement. I reach out to introduce myself to a kid, and he says, ""We don't really
shake hands here. We just hug here."" And I'm not the huggiest guy
on the face of the earth, but I've been going back to that home
every Thursday night when I'm in town, and just hugging all those kids. They demand intimacy. They demand that you behave in a way
where you're showing all the way up. And they teach you a new way to live, which is the cure
for all the ills of our culture which is a way of direct --
really putting relationship first, not just as a word, but as a reality. 08:25And the beautiful thing is,
these communities are everywhere. I started something at the Aspen Institute
called ""Weave: The Social Fabric."" This is our logo here. And we plop into a place and we find
weavers anywhere, everywhere. We find people like Asiaha Butler,
who grew up in -- who lived in Chicago, in Englewood,
in a tough neighborhood. And she was about to move
because it was so dangerous, and she looked across the street
and she saw two little girls playing in an empty lot
with broken bottles, and she turned to her husband
and she said, ""We're not leaving. We're not going to be just another family
that abandon that."" And she Googled ""volunteer in Englewood,""
and now she runs R.A.G.E., the big community organization there. 09:04Some of these people
have had tough valleys. I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio
who came home from an antiquing trip and found that her husband
had killed himself and their two kids. She now runs a free pharmacy,
she volunteers in the community, she helps women cope
with violence, she teaches. She told me, ""I grew from this
experience because I was angry. I was going to fight back against
what he tried to do to me by making a difference in the world. See, he didn't kill me. My response to him is, 'Whatever you meant to do to me,
screw you, you're not going to do it.'"" 09:38These weavers are not living
an individualistic life, they're living a relationist life,
they have a different set of values. They have moral motivations. They have vocational certitude,
they have planted themselves down. I met a guy in Youngstown, Ohio, who just held up a sign
in the town square, ""Defend Youngstown."" They have radical mutuality, and they are geniuses at relationship. 09:59There's a woman named Mary Gordon who runs something
called Roots of Empathy. And what they do is they take
a bunch of kids, an eighth grade class, they put a mom and an infant, and then the students have to guess
what the infant is thinking, to teach empathy. There was one kid in a class
who was bigger than the rest because he'd been held back,
been through the foster care system, seen his mom get killed. And he wanted to hold the baby. And the mom was nervous
because he looked big and scary. But she let this kid,
Darren, hold the baby. He held it, and he was great with it. He gave the baby back and started
asking questions about parenthood. And his final question was, ""If nobody has ever loved you,
do you think you can be a good father?"" And so what Roots of Empathy does is they reach down and they grab
people out of the valley. And that's what weavers are doing. 10:49Some of them switch jobs. Some of them stay in their same jobs. But one thing is,
they have an intensity to them. I read this -- E.O. Wilson wrote a great book
called ""Naturalist,"" about his childhood. When he was seven,
his parents were divorcing. And they sent him
to Paradise Beach in North Florida. And he'd never seen the ocean before. And he'd never seen a jellyfish before. He wrote, ""The creature was astonishing.
It existed beyond my imagination."" He was sitting on the dock one day and he saw a stingray
float beneath his feet. And at that moment, a naturalist was born
in the awe and wonder. And he makes this observation: that when you're a child, you see animals at twice the size
as you do as an adult. And that has always impressed me, because what we want as kids
is that moral intensity, to be totally given ourselves
over to something and to find that level of vocation. And when you are around these weavers, they see other people
at twice the size as normal people. They see deeper into them. And what they see is joy. 12:01On the first mountain of our life,
when we're shooting for our career, we shoot for happiness. And happiness is good,
it's the expansion of self. You win a victory, you get a promotion,
your team wins the Super Bowl, you're happy. Joy is not the expansion of self,
it's the dissolving of self. It's the moment when the skin barrier
disappears between a mother and her child, it's the moment when a naturalist
feels just free in nature. It's the moment where you're so lost
in your work or a cause, you have totally self-forgotten. And joy is a better thing
to aim for than happiness. 12:39I collect passages of joy,
of people when they lose it. One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith. In 1999, she was in a London nightclub, looking for her friends,
wondering where her handbag was. And suddenly, as she writes, ""... a rail-thin man with enormous eyes
reached across a sea of bodies for my hand. He kept asking me the same thing
over and over, 'Are you feeling it?' My ridiculous heels were killing me,
I was terrified that I might die, yet I felt simultaneously
overwhelmed with delight that 'Can I Kick It?'
should happen to be playing on this precise moment
in the history of the world on the sound system, and it was now morphing
into 'Teen Spirit.' I took the man's hand,
the top of my head blew away, we danced, we danced,
we gave ourselves up to joy."" 13:23And so what I'm trying to describe
is two different life mindsets. The first mountain mindset, which is about
individual happiness and career success. And it's a good mindset,
I have nothing against it. But we're in a national valley, because we don't have
the other mindset to balance it. We no longer feel good
about ourselves as a people, we've lost our defining
faith in our future, we don't see each other deeply,
we don't treat each other as well. And we need a lot of changes. We need an economic change
and environmental change. But we also need a cultural
and relational revolution. We need to name the language
of a recovered society. And to me, the weavers
have found that language. 14:05My theory of social change
is that society changes when a small group of people
find a better way to live, and the rest of us copy them. And these weavers have found
a better way to live. And you don't have to theorize about it. They are out there as community builders
all around the country. We just have to shift our lives a little, so we can say, ""I'm a weaver,
we're a weaver."" And if we do that, the hole inside ourselves gets filled, but more important,
the social unity gets repaired. 14:35Thank you very much. 14:36(Applause)"

", (699),"Transcript (1 Language)EnglishIvana Korom, TranslatorCamille Martínez, Reviewer00:00Adam Grant: Alright, Geoff,
start with your name and occupation. 00:03Geoff Nunberg: My name is Geoff Nunberg.
I'm a professor and a linguist. 00:07AG: How in the world does a linguist
end up writing a book about assholes? 00:11GN: Well, who better than a linguist? 00:15AG: Heads up: this episode
is going to use a lot of that word. 00:18GN: Linguist.
AG: No, not that one. 00:20GN: Bounder.
AG: No. 00:21GN: Cad.
AG: No. 00:23GN: Heel, phony.
AG: No and no. 00:25GN: Those words all articulated
a certain sense of the moral life. And ""asshole"" comes along
and kind of displaces them. 00:32AG: Today, we're talking about assholes. 00:35GN: Somebody who cheats on his wife but not necessarily
on his expense reports. The asshole is somebody whose efforts
to expand and swell his own sense of privilege is hurtful to others: the other employees,
whose work he takes credit for, the secretary who he has
picking up his laundry, whatever. 00:54(Music) 00:58AG: Look, I know it's not a polite word. But it's not going away. And neither are assholes. And the word itself evokes a feeling in us that something tamer
like ""jerk"" just doesn't. So we're going to use the word,
because that's what the pros do. 01:13Bob Sutton: I said, ""I want
to use the word 'asshole,' and you would never publish that
in 'Harvard Business Review.'"" She said, ""Try me."" 01:23(Theme music) 01:30AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED. I'm an organizational psychologist. I study how to make
the people you work with not suck. In this show, I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people, because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work. Today: assholes, a field guide. Everyone's worked with at least one. How do you deal with them? And is it possible to create
an asshole-free office? 01:58(Music) 02:03Thanks to Bonobos
for sponsoring this episode. 02:06(Music) 02:17So, apparently there's a difference
between being an asshole, an asshat and an assclown. Yep, the Oxford English Dictionary
has recognized all three. But ""asshat"" and ""assclown""
don't have the same sting. They're mostly synonyms for ""obnoxious."" An asshole is someone who disrespects
and demeans other people and either denies it or just doesn't care. Think about the assholes
you've had to work with. How did they show it? Sometimes, it's passive-aggressive: stealing credit,
doling out blame unfairly, invading privacy, breaking promises. Other times, it's active-aggressive: badmouthing, screaming, ridiculing. 02:59Bob Sutton: My father used to say to me, ""When you grow up,
whatever you do, don't be an asshole and don't work with them
and don't work for them."" 03:09AG: Meet Bob Sutton. He's an organizational
psychologist at Stanford. He's become something of a connoisseur
of assholes at work. 03:17BS: An asshole is somebody
who leaves you feeling demeaned, de-energized and disrespected -- somebody who leaves you feeling like shit. 03:28AG: In 2007, he wrote
a whole book on assholes, and, well, he touched a nerve. 03:33BS: I got thousands of emails from people who felt
as if they were victims of assholes. 03:38AG: Turns out,
workplaces are full of them. And through his research, Bob has learned that it's pretty tough
to be an asshole to the people above you. Being an asshole has to do with
how you treat the people across from you and especially below you. 03:53BS: Abuse does seem to roll downhill. When I looked at my emails
and also the research, in about 80 percent of the cases, the person who was named
as the asshole in their life was their immediate boss. 04:06AG: The more Bob heard
from employees and leaders about the impact of this kind of behavior, the more he became convinced that it must have an actual,
measurable cost. 04:14BS: Just in the last decade, studying all forms
of abusive behavior in the workplace has become sort of a growth industry. And if you and I started
doing the list of all the costs that nasty people impose
on the people around them, both the fiscal and mental health costs, it's just stunning. 04:34AG: One notable experiment
was done with medical teams in Israel. Each team had a physician and two nurses
from the newborn intensive care unit, and they were brought in
to work with a visiting expert. Some teams were randomly assigned
to be berated by the expert. He told them he wasn't impressed
with the quality of medicine there, and they wouldn't last a week
in his department. After being insulted like this, the accuracy of the team's diagnoses
was almost 20 percent lower. And the procedures they did
were 15 percent less effective. I'm guessing you wouldn't want a 15-percent-less-effective
heart transplant. 05:09BS: I mean, this is one
of the biggest problems with treating people like dirt: they're less likely
to call out errors done by others. 05:16AG: To avoid mistakes,
people have to communicate, especially about things
that might go wrong. An asshole creates an environment of fear, where people stay silent
to avoid rocking the boat. And if getting demotivated
isn't bad enough, get this: working with an asshole
literally makes you dumber. 05:34BS: There's some evidence that after one has been
abused or disrespected, that one's cognitive ability
is temporarily affected. 05:41AG: One experiment
is especially revealing. Students showed up for a study, only to learn that they were
in the wrong room and had entered a professor's office. For some students, the professor
just directed them to the right room. The other half of the time,
the students got this: 05:56(Clip) (Door opening) 05:58Professor: Excuse me, can't you read? There's a sign on the door that tells you the experiment
will be in room 123, but you didn't even bother
to look at the door, did you? Instead you prefer to disturb me
and ask for directions, when you can clearly see that I'm busy. I'm not a secretary here,
I'm a busy professor. 06:17(Door slams) 06:18AG: What an asshole! The poor students who were randomly
assigned to that treatment were then asked to solve some anagrams. And they solved a quarter fewer
anagrams correctly. Then the students saw someone
drop a bunch of books. The ones who had just been verbally abused
were nine times less likely to help. Assholes undermine our ability
to think clearly and creatively. But what seems absolutely damning is that they also leave us with more
negative attitudes toward others. 06:46BS: Prolonged bullying
turns other people into assholes, so it's a contagious disease that spreads. 06:51AG: Of course, everyone has a limit. At some point, people just give up. They quit. Occasionally, they even get revenge. 06:59BS: There's research
from fast-food restaurants that when people have an abusive
supervisor running the restaurant that employees are more likely to steal. 07:07AG: (Laughs) Although,
if they're stealing fast food, they're only punishing themselves. 07:12BS: (Laughs) 07:13(Music) 07:17When I talk about the cost
of assholes at work, there are people who push back. They say, sometimes you just need
to be an asshole to be successful. And there's one example
that pops up every time. Let's call it ""the Steve Jobs question."" Recently, I had a chance
to sit down with someone uniquely qualified to weigh in on it. 07:37Walter Isaacson: Well,
he was a deeply spiritual, very intense person, who had rough edges
and was nasty at times and mean. 07:48AG: This is Walter Isaacson. He wrote the definitive
biography on Steve Jobs, spending countless hours with him and hundreds of people
who worked closely with him. 07:57WI: When I started
working on ""Steve Jobs,"" Woz -- Wozniak -- said to me, ""The main question you have to answer
is: Did he have to be so mean?"" 08:07AG: ""Ruthless,"" ""deceitful,"" ""cruel"" -- these are words that have often
been applied to Jobs, very frequently by his closest friends. Early on, Jobs screwed his cofounder
out of a big bonus and lied about it. He screamed and swore at colleagues,
belittled employees and harassed interviewees
by asking about their sex lives. This kind of behavior was what led Jobs
to get forced out of Apple -- his own company -- in the 80s. Take it from one
of his longtime collaborators, Apple engineer and designer, Jony Ive. He told Walter Isaacson
that when Jobs got frustrated, his way to achieve catharsis
was to hurt someone. According to Ive, Jobs felt he had a liberty
and a license to do that. 08:50WI: Working with him, you know, I was subject to watching him sort of, have that
very ""mercurial"" personality, as he put it. 09:02AG: I think we both know
a fair number of entrepreneurs who have held Jobs up as their role model and said, ""Look, he wasn't
the nicest guy in the world. And that's proof that this is
sometimes how you have to be."" Did he succeed in spite of
or because of his cruelty, in your view? 09:19WI: I guess my answer, in retrospect, is no, you don't have to be that mean. You don't have to be cruel to people. 09:26AG: There's a huge difference
between being demanding and being demeaning. Being demanding is having
extremely high standards and pretty low tolerance
for work that falls below them. Being demeaning is devaluing
other people as human beings, treating them with such disrespect
that they feel worthless. 09:45WI: When I asked Steve,
""Did you have to be so mean? Did you have to be so cruel to people?"" He said to me, ""You know,
when people do something that sucks, I just have to tell them it sucks, because I'm just a middle-class kid, trying to make sure I don't have
B players on my team. And so I can't afford
to be gentle and nice."" 10:07AG: Research suggests that leaders
who demean their employees have learned to rationalize aggression. They see that it sometimes
gets short-term results, while the long-term damage
is often invisible to them. So they justify it as necessary
to achieve their goals. Which means, if you think you have
to be an asshole to be successful, you might be an asshole. 10:28(Music) 10:33When you've had to deal
with an asshole at work, what have you done? If you don't have the power
to get rid of them, what should you do? Sometimes, you just have to learn
how to have a hard conversation. 10:43Sheila Heen: Yeah. 10:45AG: You're a lawyer
by training, aren't you? 10:47SH: (Laughs) Do you mean
am I an asshole by training? Yes, yes I am. (Laughs) 10:52AG: Sheila Heen is a recovering lawyer who teaches negotiation
at Harvard Law School. She cofounded a company
that specializes in conflict mediation and coauthored the book
""Difficult Conversations."" Basically, Sheila's job is teaching people
how to deal with an asshole -- and how to avoid acing like one. 11:09SH: Part of the job of lawyers in society
is to help people with conflicts. And the way that we / they
sometimes go about it often ends up escalating the conflict
rather than helping resolve it. And that's essentially the definition
of asshole-like behavior. 11:26AG: But sometimes the conflict happens
because one person is just an asshole. How often is that the case
in your experience as a mediator? 11:35SH: Well, it is true
100 percent of the time that each side would say
that the other side is being an asshole. 11:43(Laughter) 11:44We all hurt each other, upset each other, embarrass each other in front of other people, publicly -- just misstep and contribute to the other
person feeling really badly treated, sometimes in ways that we don't intend,
usually in ways that we don't intend, but occasionally in ways
that we do intend. 12:06AG: Sheila has three key recommendations
for having that conversation. The first is to give the other person
the benefit of the doubt. 12:13SH: People will say, ""You know,
you just have to assume good intentions."" And I think that often that's true. But I think assume good intentions
is just a little too strong. I think instead it should be:
assume you don't know. And that's the conversation
that we need to have, because I don't know what was up with you, but whatever it was, it's a problem. So let's figure that out
and see if we can fix it. 12:38AG: That's fantastic. Yeah, because that motivates me then
to go and find out whatever I'm missing. I'll go and try to learn: What were you thinking?
What was your intent? What was going on in that situation? That's really helpful. 12:50SH: I love the orientation
that that just created for you, which is that now you actually have
a little bit of curiosity. And so the conversation isn't about,
you know, letting her have it and straightening her out and letting her know
she shouldn't be an asshole next time. The conversation is about, ""Now I'm just curious
what was going on with you, because I was surprised by it, and we should address it so that we just won't have
this problem next time."" That's an orientation that is much more
likely to produce a better conversation and to solve the problem,
if it's solvable. 13:26(Music) 13:31AG: But Sheila, if you think
someone is just a total asshole, how should you deal with them? 13:37SH: The dilemma is that the worst
thing you can do, in many ways, is to do nothing over time. But the second worst thing that you can do is to fight back in the moment. They've been playing that game,
if they're a certified asshole, for a very long time, and so you are agreeing to basically
play the game on their turf. But as soon as you are able, whether that's an hour later
or the next morning, you come back to them
to have a conversation. 14:03AG: Sheila's second tip
for talking to office assholes is to make sure you don't put them
on the defensive. 14:09SH: What you're going to want
to say to them is something like, ""I don't know why you feel the need
to undermine me or demean me. I don't know why you feel the need
to humiliate everybody and control everything."" That's what you want to say to them. 14:23AG: Wait -- I'm not supposed to say that? 14:25SH: You can say it in your head. And you can say it in front of the mirror, if it will make you feel better. But what you're doing is, you're telling them something
about their intentions and their character, and you can bet that they're
going to argue with you about that. What they can't argue with
is about the impact that it's had on you. So, the most important thing
is to separate intentions and impact. 14:55AG: Sometimes assholes aren't aware
of the impact of their own behavior. 14:59SH: We know what we're trying to do
to get our point across. What we don't see and people
sometimes don't share with us is just how upsetting, demeaning,
unprofessional it was, and the ripple effect that it had
throughout the team and the organization. 15:15AG: Sheila's third suggestion
is to help them find a less demeaning way to accomplish their goals. I once worked with a colleague who was known to yell at people
occasionally in meetings. The first time I saw it happen, I called afterward to explain that I found
it disrespectful and unprofessional. My colleague said, ""Well, it was necessary
to get my point across."" And I realized this was someone
who had rationalized aggression. I wasn't sure what to do at that point. So I asked Sheila how we should think
about responding in a situation like that. 15:44SH: If you want to use
a little bit of humor in that moment, if you can think of it, when he says, ""Yeah, people feel that way, but that's the only way
for me to get my point across,"" you can say, ""Really? It was my impression that you were
smarter and more creative than that, so I bet you could come up
with ways to be just as clear, without having to actually
rip somebody else apart. But maybe I'm overestimating you,
maybe that's not true."" 16:09(Laughter) 16:12AG: Oh, I love that. So I could actually gently give them
a better way to accomplish their goals. 16:17SH: Yeah, it's a little ... The story in their head is,
the ends justify the means. Right? ""It was important for me
to get my point across, and if some people's feelings were hurt,
boo-hoo, that's not as important."" OK. I actually am going to challenge
whether that's true. 16:39AG: Sometimes, you can
use humor to challenge it without even saying a word. Back in the 1990s, the CEO of a tech company, Gordon Eubanks, was known for an unusual brand of insult. Gordon was working to grow Symantec
into a Fortune 500 company. And for some reason, he had a habit of comparing people
unfavorably to vegetables. 17:01Mark Bailey: ""That guy's dumber
than a head of lettuce."" 17:03(Laughter) 17:05AG: Mark Bailey was working
for Gordon at the time. Did he have other vegetable phrases? 17:10MB: Yeah, he would refer to
a zucchini as well, but the head of lettuce stuck. That was the one that I remember
him using pretty regularly. You knew exactly what he meant
when he said it. He did not think highly
of the person when he said that. 17:22AG: Was it always about a person,
sometimes about an idea? 17:28MB: It was usually about a person. 17:30AG: After everyone on Gordon's
team had been compared to a farmer's market's worth of produce, they finally decided to do something
about their boss's behavior. So Mark and his colleagues
went grocery shopping before their next staff meeting. 17:43MB: We arranged it so that we were all
gathering outside the conference room, and then Gordon shows up for the staff
meeting and kind of growls, ""How come everybody's
not in the room, yet? Are we going to get started?"" We all nod and then we let him
walk into the room first. 17:58AG: Gordon stepped inside and saw that every seat
at the conference table was occupied by a head of lettuce. Some of the lettuce heads had mustaches,
some were wearing sunglasses. What would you do if you were Gordon? When people get called on bad behavior, there's a real risk
that they'll get defensive and start calling people names
worse than vegetables. 18:18MB: And when he comes in and sees
all the heads of lettuce on the table, he just starts to laugh out loud. 18:24(Laughs) And we all got a big laugh out of it. 18:29AG: What was so clever
about the heads of lettuce prank is that it was nonthreatening. And Gordon realized
that Mark wasn't just playing a prank. He was also making a point. 18:37Gordon Eubanks: He thought it was funny
and probably would be helpful. It would unite a group of people. 18:44AG: And maybe most importantly, Gordon ended up
reflecting on his behavior. 18:47GE: Well, I'm sure people would think, yes, I was probably really an asshole. If you mean if someone can be very
difficult and unnecessarily abrasive, I'm sure there were times
when that happened. I've mellowed, of course, over the years. If someone steals your parking place, that's a different kind of an asshole than someone that's trying
to achieve something with a group of people. Demeaning, though, is wrong, and I'm sure there were times
I was demeaning. And that's a problem in an organization. 19:25(Music) 19:30AG: Yep, demeaning is a problem. What if you could
get rid of it altogether? Is it possible to create
a workplace with no assholes? 19:37(Music) 19:40More on that after the break. 19:43(Music) 19:50OK, this is going to be
a different kind of ad. I've played a personal role
in selecting the sponsors for this podcast, because they all have
interesting cultures of their own. Today, we're going
inside the workplace at Bonobos. 20:05(Music) 20:08D. Fooks remembers the first time Carla and her husband Aaron walked into
his Bonobos shop in Scottsdale. Carla was on a mission. 20:15DF: She was on the hunt
to really trim down his pants. 20:19AG: She had been in the store before and told D. she was trying
to change her husband's look. But he wasn't having it. If she ever got him in there, Carla said, she and D. had to team up
and seize the day. 20:31DF: Carla loved for Aaron to wear
some of the brighter, more fun prints. Aaron was a little more conservative and liked some of the more plain patterns. So there was that fun
little battle between them. 20:42AG: Carla won. And that first visit
was the beginning of a routine. Aaron and Carla would go golfing together, grab some lunch and then come into Bonobos and shop. 20:52DF: They'd always have
this playful back-and-forth, and there was always that fun exchange
of Carla pushing the boundary and Aaron realigning and resetting
where that line is drawn in the sand. 21:04AG: Everyone in the store
loved watching them together. They seemed like a real team. 21:09DF: You know, when you see a couple
who loves each other that much, it gives you hope in more ways than one. And I think they had an effect
on all of us in the shop. 21:20AG: There's evidence that customers
find ongoing service relationships more satisfying than one-off encounters
with a different provider each time. But building that relationship
isn't always easy. At Bonobos, the guides in their shops are encouraged to make
meaningful connections with customers, while of course respecting
their boundaries. As Aaron and Carla became regulars,
they developed a real bond with D. 21:40DF: It extended much more
than just a customer. They were kind of like family, in a way. 21:46AG: But sometimes,
even regulars take a break. Months went by where D.
didn't see Carla and Aaron. He didn't really think too much of it. Then, one day,
Aaron walked into the store. 21:56DF: He had come in and said,
""Hey, I haven't been in in a while. I kind of wanted to get resized
because I've lost some weight."" 22:03AG: D. went to pull up
Aaron's purchase history, which was under Carla's name. And he suddenly had a sinking feeling
about why Aaron was shopping alone. 22:11DF: It was almost like
a crazy, crazy feeling, just dawned on me. I feel like I intuitively just knew. And everything in me just kind of dropped. 22:25AG: Carla had passed away
a few months earlier of breast cancer. It had been quick -- only a month
after she was diagnosed with a recurrence. D. offered his condolences
and asked Aaron how he was holding up. 22:37DF: You know, he smiled, and it was one of those where you can tell
there was some pain behind it. But to feel his strength
and to feel his positive energy was indescribable. 22:50AG: Aaron was just there
for some everyday shopping. But he happened to mention that he had
a black-tie event later that week. He'd lost a lot of weight
so his tux didn't fit, and he was just going to rent one. After Aaron left the store,
D. leapt into action. He had noticed Aaron admiring
a particular tux -- the Capstone Italian Wool in navy. So he rush-ordered the tux
as a surprise gift to Aaron. It arrived on Aaron's
doorstep the next day, along with a letter
signed by everyone at the store. That afternoon, D.'s phone rang. 23:21DF: ""Hey, how's it going, Aaron?"" And his response was,
""What do you mean, how's it going? Man, I can't believe you guys did this."" He was just floored. It was one of the most
heartfelt thank-yous I can remember ever getting in my life. 23:37AG: It's what you do, D. says,
when you believe in the idea that customer relations
really are about just that -- a relationship. 23:45DF: We hope that you'll get, you know, at least put a smile on your face
for even that split second. So, it was just something that felt right. 23:56AG: Bonobos makes great clothes
that can fit every guy. Ordering on their website
is easy, they ship fast, and if it doesn't fit, they want to know. Visit bonobos.com, enter promo code TED at checkout
and get 20 percent off your first order. That's bonobos.com and promo code TED for 20 percent off. 24:13(Music) 24:18(Music) 24:21I'm always shocked
when I hear stories like these. 24:24Cindy Hess: The partner was really upset
and took his briefcase, he was enraged and threw it
against the wall. Made a dent in the wall. 24:32(Clip) Woman: I had a manager who told
junior members of the firm, verbatim, ""You should spend your 20s sucking up
and doing your manager's work for them."" 24:41AG: My students have had
to work with some real jerks. 24:45(Clip) Man: My boss's boss once punched me
in the chest and publicly berated me for not wearing the correct hat outdoors. Asshole. 24:55AG: After decades
of working with companies and combing through the research, Stanford's Bob Sutton eventually concluded
that assholes make us all less productive. 25:04BS: Organizations that don't hire
people who treat others like dirt and who call out one another
when they act nasty, they're more effective places
and they're more humane places to work. 25:16AG: So Bob decided
to put a stake in the ground. As the expert in the field, he's called on organizations to set
a zero-tolerance policy for demeaning and disrespectful behavior. No bullying, no sabotage. A ""no asshole"" rule. 25:32Luis von Ahn: I love
this rule, I live by it. 25:34AG: This is Luis von Ahn. 25:35LvA: In general, in a company, it's better to have a hole
than an asshole. So it's better to not have -- if there's an asshole, it's really better
to just not have the person there. That basically means, don't hire assholes
or you should fire assholes. 25:48AG: Luis is the CEO and cofounder
of a company called Duolingo. It's an app that gamifies the process
of learning a new language. It has more than 300 million users, and it can teach you practically
every word you need to know in French, Korean, Navajo ... even Klingon. Well, almost every word. 26:08LvA: I'm not sure how to call
somebody an asshole in Spanish, even though it's my native language. 26:13AG: It's not ""pendejo""? 26:15LvA: So, ""pendejo"" is very Mexican. I'm from Guatemala. In Guatemala, we use ""cerote,""
but that's very regional slang. 26:24AG: What about French? 26:27LvA: I would not know
how to do this in French. I'm too remedial for that in French. 26:32AG: Well, I heard there's an app
that could fix that. 26:34(Laughter) 26:36LvA: In Duolingo, we do not
teach the word for asshole. 26:39AG: Duolingo is not just
a hugely popular app. It's a highly desirable place to work. In 2018, it was named one of the best
workplaces by ""Inc."" magazine and one of the top company cultures
by ""Entrepreneur"" magazine. When Luis and his cofounder
were launching the company, they were very conscious
about being anti-asshole. 26:58LvA: He said, ""I mainly just want to have
a place where I go to work every day, and I'm really happy to go to work. I just want to look forward
to go to work."" That made a lot of sense to me,
and that is what I strive for. 27:11AG: Luis is a computer scientist. Earlier in his career,
he invented reCAPTCHA. It's that little box on a website where you retype
the squiggly letters you see to prove you're a human and not a bot. The purpose was to protect
websites from abuse. Now at Duolingo, he's determined to build a culture
that protects employees from abuse. 27:30LvA: I have made this mistake
many times in my life, where there really is somebody
that's just like, brilliant. But really, they're an asshole. What I have found over time
is that generally you can find somebody equally as brilliant who's not an asshole. As I get older, I just have much less
tolerance for assholes than I used to. 27:49AG: So, Luis and his cofounder have tried
to keep assholes out of the front door through their interview process. Did you get it wrong early on, at all? 27:57LvA: Yeah. It is not the case that no asshole
has ever worked at Duolingo. 28:02AG: So how did the false positives
sneak in the door? 28:07LvA: Well, it's hard, particularly when you start hiring
more and more people. At first, you can hire people
who you either directly know or you know somebody that knows them. Eventually, you start hiring
randos off the internet that apply to work at your company. And it's much harder to know
whether they're an asshole or not. It is rare that anybody will tell you, ""Do not hire this person,
they're an asshole."" That is rare. That almost never happens. 28:32AG: When you're hiring, one of the weak links
in the asshole filter is referrals. Job applicants get to pick
their best references, people who have seen them
in a positive light, people who want to help them, or in the worst case, get rid of them,
by foisting them on someone else. But when talking to references, you can learn to ask
the right kinds of questions and spot the nuances in the answers. 28:54LvA: A really great question is,
""Do they work well with others?"" Nobody tells you, ""No,
they don't work well with others."" That's rare. The answer you want is, ""Oh, my God, yes,
they're great at working with others."" That's the answer you want. The one you don't want is, ""Yeah, um ... for most people, they are."" Like, that -- that means, ""Nah, they're actually not good
at working with others, and they've had trouble."" 29:18AG: I've found that you can get
references to be more honest by forcing them to choose
between two negative qualities. What's more likely: that this applicant
will be a total pushover or maybe a little manipulative? 29:30LvA: Hiring mistakes, where you hire a person
that you shouldn't have hired, are significantly more costly
than the other way around, which is, you didn't hire somebody
you should have hired. Those are mistakes, too,
but they're not very costly. 29:45(Music) 29:48AG: Here's a question:
in your team, what's more productive: replacing an average performer with a star or replacing a toxic worker
with an average one? One study looked at
the performance and turnover of more than 50,000 employees. It turned out that just replacing
a toxic worker with an average one can be twice as profitable
as upgrading an average one to a star. 30:12LvA: I don't think I've ever come across
somebody that is so brilliant, so irreplaceable, that it can justify them being assholes. 30:21AG: So you wouldn't hire a Steve Jobs? 30:24LvA: Well, I think Steve Jobs
was an amazing founder, I don't know how good
as an employee he would be. My guess is, he'd probably be
a shitty employee. 30:33AG: Who knows whether Jobs
would have been a good employee. But one thing seems clear: he probably would have been a vocal one. And giving employees a voice might be just the thing
that workplaces need to truly lock out assholes. 30:48CH: It really gives them a chance
to feel empowered and to be empowered. 30:52AG: This is Cindy Hess. She's a partner at a law firm. And one day, she got
some unexpected feedback. 30:58CH: OK, so the envelope comes,
it's a sealed envelope, you open it up, there were
boxes to check that said, ""Would you want to work
with this person again?"" And I think one person at least said, no, they wouldn't want
to work with me again. And my heart sunk when I saw that. ""Oh, gosh, what have I done
to make that person feel that way?"" 31:21AG: The anonymous person
who filled out this form was a junior associate
who reported to Cindy and apparently thought she was selfish. 31:28CH: I was nice when I needed to be nice, took interest in somebody
when that would serve my needs, but maybe that was transparent, that I wasn't being genuine
in that interest. 31:44AG: So I have to ask you, then: Do you think that in the past,
before you got this feedback, you were kind of an asshole? 31:51CH: (Laughs) Well ... I guess I would say that sometimes I didn't act in the best way. 32:05AG: So do you think other people
called you an asshole? 32:07CH: Maybe. I hope not. 32:09(Laughter) 32:11AG: So I will say,
by my definition at least, I think you are not an asshole. 32:15CH: Thank you. You know, I think my reviews
have gone way up, because I really realized
that the behavior I was exhibiting wasn't always the best behavior. And so I changed it. 32:30AG: Unfortunately, many people
aren't as open to feedback and course correction as Cindy. If you want to stop
the assholes in your office, you have to address the thing
that lets them get away with it -- the reward system. It's a mistake to just incentivize
individual achievement. You have to reward and promote people
who elevate others, rather than undermining them. which means paying special attention to how those in power
treat those who lack it. To prevent bosses
from acting like assholes, you have to give subordinates power. When I gave a talk
at Cindy's law firm, Fenwick &amp; West, I discovered that they have
some unique tools for doing this. They actually let junior associates
pick which senior partners they work with. 33:12CH: It's truly a free market. When you're a partner and you have
a new client coming in the door and you need to staff it
with an associate or two, you have to go and ask people, and it's across the entire
corporate group. For example, I'm a corporate partner, so I would go and ask various associates
to work with me on that client. And they have the unfettered
ability to say no. 33:35AG: Which means that
when a partner is a ""bosshole,"" word spreads fast. 33:40CH: Associates are going to choose
to work with the people that they enjoy working with,
who they're going to learn from, who are going to mentor them, who are going to take
an interest in their career. And those people
who don't act in that way, those partners who don't act in that way, are going to have a really difficult time
getting their matters staffed. 33:59AG: So that means, if there's a partner
I think is an asshole, I can just choose not to work
with that person? 34:04CH: That's exactly right. 34:06AG: That's amazing. How do I get that job? 34:08CH: Yeah, and we've had situations with partners with a significant
amount of business saying, ""I want to have a designated
group of associates to work with me."" And the firm said, ""No.
We're not going to do that. We're not going to modify
our free-market approach because you're having a more
difficult time getting your work staffed."" 34:28AG: To make sure leaders know
how they're being viewed, they do anonymous upward reviews, where junior associates
rate senior partners -- which doesn't happen in many law firms. 34:37CH: When I was interviewing
with law firms, I could tell when a law firm
was really catering to a star. I remember being a first-year associate
and I would see big corner offices with vestibules to get into that office, like of the secretary. You could tell that those
were the sorts of places where they were really catering
to particular partners who had a lot of power. 35:05AG: Assholes thrive
in certain kinds of workplaces -- places where leaders say
they want teamwork, but only pay and promote
on individual results. The classic term for it is ""the folly
of rewarding A, while hoping for B."" For one example, look at a company
that was huge in the 90s. 35:21(Clip) Man: It starts with good people. 35:23AG: Its stated core values
were communication, respect, integrity and excellence. 35:29(Clip) Man: There probably are times
that there's a desire to cut corners, but we can't have that at Enron. 35:37AG: Enron may have claimed
to value good behavior, but they actually rewarded
ruthlessness and selfishness. 35:43BS: One of my favorite
diagnostic questions that I like to ask in organizations is, ""Who is a superstar here?"" 35:50AG: Psychologist Bob Sutton again. 35:52BS: And if the superstars are
pretty consistently people who are jerks, people who are takers, that's a sign to me that the game is
that those people are getting rewarded, despite the rhetoric. It means that they're forgiven, and to me, that's the real test. 36:08AG: Most important question. 36:10BS: Yes, sir. 36:11AG: Do you believe that there is
such a thing as an asshole-free workplace? 36:15BS: No. 36:17AG: Damn it! (BS laughs) Damn it. You asshole! (BS laughs) 36:21BS: I think -- 36:23AG: I was really hoping
you would tell me there's one. 36:25BS: I think there are workplaces where there's very few
or maybe no certified assholes, but there's always going to be
some temporary jerk behavior, just because we both know
it's so easy for us to accidentally leave people
feeling disrespected. We're going to be tired,
we're going to be grouchy, in a hurry, somebody's going to yell at us --
it's going to happen. But the difference is, what happens when there's a transgression? 36:52AG: When the belief that it's necessary
to be an asshole doesn't get challenged, behavior often becomes normalized, not only by the perpetrators,
but also by victims and witnesses. Here's conflict mediator,
Sheila Heen, again. 37:05SH: The people who say it's actually
a big plus to have an asshole in your organization, the people who would say
the no-asshole rule produces cultures that are very polite but are not
as dedicated to excellence or quality, part of what they're
identifying is this tension, which is that in polite cultures, if our main goal is not
to hurt anybody's feelings, well, then we don't actually
give each other feedback or point out, ""Actually we could
be doing this a lot better."" And so things get driven underground, and it takes an asshole
to come along and say, ""What are we thinking? This is stupid."" Right? 37:47AG: Do you think that workplaces
should have no-asshole rules? 37:53SH: Do I think workplaces
should have no-asshole rules? Yes. If the implicit rule
behind the no-asshole rule is, ""nobody should ever feel upset,"" that's not really a workable rule. I think, in workplaces, the rule should be
that how you treat people matters. A lot. And it doesn't mean that we won't
sometimes have hard conversations. 38:18AG: I think every leader
has a responsibility to strive for a no-asshole culture. It's the smart thing to do
if you want to attract, motivate and retain talented people. But more importantly,
it's the right thing to do. We spend so many hours at work, and we have a right to be treated
with dignity during those hours. So, screen assholes
out of your hiring process. Make sure you don't reward
people who get individual results at the expense of others and create a toxic culture. And when someone is demeaning, see if you can find a respectful way
to let them know what impact they've had. If you don't have the power
to remove or reform an asshole, your best bet is to minimize
your interaction. And if that isn't an option, you can at least control
how you view that person. Bob Sutton has a colleague
who has some fun with it. 39:05BS: He pretends that he's
sort of an asshole specialist, and he just considers himself really lucky
to see this spectacular, amazing specimen. 39:16(Theme music) 39:23AG: WorkLife is hosted by me, Adam Grant. The show is produced by TED

1,The secret to great opportunities? The person you haven't met yet,Tanya Menon,Feb 2018,"We often find ourselves stuck in narrow social circles with similar people. What habits confine us, and how can we break them? Organizational psychologist Tanya Menon considers how we can be more intentional about expanding our social universes -- and how it can lead to new ideas and opportunities.", (70K),"Transcript (24 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаئۇيغۇرچەالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I started teaching MBA students 17 years ago. Sometimes I run into
my students years later. And when I run into them,
a funny thing happens. I don't remember just their faces; I also remember where exactly
in the classroom they were sitting. And I remember who
they were sitting with as well. This is not because I have
any special superpowers of memory. The reason I can remember them is because they are creatures of habit. They are sitting with their
favorite people in their favorite seats. They find their twins,
they stay with them for the whole year. 00:39Now, the danger of this
for my students is they're at risk of leaving the university
with just a few people who are exactly like them. They're going to squander their chance
for an international, diverse network. How could this happen to them? My students are open-minded. They come to business school precisely
so that they can get great networks. 01:02Now, all of us socially narrow
in our lives, in our school, in work, and so I want you to think about this one. How many of you here
brought a friend along for this talk? I want you to look
at your friend a little bit. Are they of the same nationality as you? Are they of the same gender as you? Are they of the same race? Really look at them closely. Don't they kind of look like you as well? 01:31(Laughter) 01:32The muscle people are together, and the people with the same hairstyles and the checked shirts. 01:38We all do this in life. We all do it in life, and in fact,
there's nothing wrong with this. It makes us comfortable to be
around people who are similar. The problem is when
we're on a precipice, right? When we're in trouble,
when we need new ideas, when we need new jobs,
when we need new resources -- this is when we really pay a price
for living in a clique. 02:01Mark Granovetter, the sociologist,
had a famous paper ""The Strength of Weak Ties,"" and what he did in this paper
is he asked people how they got their jobs. And what he learned was that
most people don't get their jobs through their strong ties -- their father,
their mother, their significant other. They instead get jobs through weak ties,
people who they just met. So if you think about what
the problem is with your strong ties, think about your
significant other, for example. The network is redundant. Everybody that they know, you know. Or I hope you know them. Right? Your weak ties --
people you just met today -- they are your ticket
to a whole new social world. 02:43The thing is that we have this amazing
ticket to travel our social worlds, but we don't use it very well. Sometimes we stay awfully close to home. And today, what I want to talk about is: What are those habits that keep
human beings so close to home, and how can we be
a little bit more intentional about traveling our social universe? 03:03footnotefootnoteSo let's look at the first strategy. The first strategy is to use
a more imperfect social search engine. What I mean by a social search engine is how you are finding
and filtering your friends. And so people always tell me, ""I want to get lucky through the network. I want to get a new job.
I want to get a great opportunity."" And I say, ""Well, that's really hard, because your networks
are so fundamentally predictable."" Map out your habitual daily footpath, and what you'll probably discover
is that you start at home, you go to your school or your workplace, you maybe go up
the same staircase or elevator, you go to the bathroom --
the same bathroom -- and the same stall in that bathroom, you end up in the gym, then you come right back home. It's like stops on a train schedule. It's that predictable. It's efficient, but the problem is,
you're seeing exactly the same people. Make your network
slightly more inefficient. Go to a bathroom on a different floor. You encounter a whole new
network of people. 04:09The other side of it is how
we are actually filtering. And we do this automatically. The minute we meet someone,
we are looking at them, we meet them, we are initially seeing, ""You're interesting."" ""You're not interesting.""
""You're relevant."" We do this automatically.
We can't even help it. And what I want to encourage you
to do instead is to fight your filters. I want you to take a look
around this room, and I want you to identify
the least interesting person that you see, and I want you to connect with them
over the next coffee break. And I want you to go
even further than that. What I want you to do is find
the most irritating person you see as well and connect with them. 04:49footnotefootnoteWhat you are doing with this exercise
is you are forcing yourself to see what you don't want to see, to connect with who
you don't want to connect with, to widen your social world. To truly widen, what we have to do is, we've got to fight our sense of choice. We've got to fight our choices. And my students hate this,
but you know what I do? I won't let them sit
in their favorite seats. I move them around from seat to seat. I force them to work with different people so there are more accidental
bumps in the network where people get a chance
to connect with each other. And we studied exactly this kind
of an intervention at Harvard University. At Harvard, when you look at
the rooming groups, there's freshman rooming groups,
people are not choosing those roommates. They're of all different races,
all different ethnicities. Maybe people are initially uncomfortable
with those roommates, but the amazing thing is, at the end of a year with those students, they're able to overcome
that initial discomfort. They're able to find deep-level
commonalities with people. 05:52footnotefootnoteSo the takeaway here is not just
""take someone out to coffee."" It's a little more subtle. It's ""go to the coffee room."" When researchers talk about social hubs, what makes a social hub so special
is you can't choose; you can't predict who
you're going to meet in that place. And so with these social hubs,
the paradox is, interestingly enough, to get randomness, it requires, actually, some planning. In one university that I worked at, there was a mail room
on every single floor. What that meant is that the only people
who would bump into each other are those who are actually on that floor and who are bumping
into each other anyway. At another university I worked at,
there was only one mail room, so all the faculty
from all over that building would run into each other
in that social hub. A simple change in planning, a huge difference in the traffic of people and the accidental bumps in the network. 06:52Here's my question for you: What are you doing that breaks you
from your social habits? Where do you find yourself in places where you get injections
of unpredictable diversity? And my students give me
some wonderful examples. They tell me when they're doing
pickup basketball games, or my favorite example
is when they go to a dog park. They tell me it's even better
than online dating when they're there. 07:17So the real thing that
I want you to think about is we've got to fight our filters. We've got to make ourselves
a little more inefficient, and by doing so, we are creating
a more imprecise social search engine. And you're creating that randomness, that luck that is going to cause you
to widen your travels, through your social universe. 07:38But in fact, there's more to it than that. Sometimes we actually buy ourselves
a second-class ticket to travel our social universe. We are not courageous
when we reach out to people. Let me give you an example of that. A few years ago, I had
a very eventful year. That year, I managed to lose a job, I managed to get a dream job
overseas and accept it, I had a baby the next month, I got very sick, I was unable to take the dream job. And so in a few weeks,
what ended up happening was, I lost my identity as a faculty member, and I got a very stressful
new identity as a mother. What I also got was tons
of advice from people. And the advice I despised
more than any other advice was, ""You've got to go network with everybody."" When your psychological world
is breaking down, the hardest thing to do
is to try and reach out and build up your social world. 08:34footnotefootnoteAnd so we studied exactly this idea
on a much larger scale. What we did was we looked at high
and low socioeconomic status people, and we looked at them in two situations. We looked at them first
in a baseline condition, when they were quite comfortable. And what we found was that
our lower socioeconomic status people, when they were comfortable,
were actually reaching out to more people. They thought of more people. They were also less constrained
in how they were networking. They were thinking of more diverse people than the higher-status people. Then we asked them
to think about maybe losing a job. We threatened them. And once they thought about that, the networks they generated
completely differed. The lower socioeconomic status
people reached inwards. They thought of fewer people. They thought of less-diverse people. The higher socioeconomic status
people thought of more people, they thought of a broader network, they were positioning themselves
to bounce back from that setback. 09:34Let's consider what this actually means. Imagine that you were being
spontaneously unfriended by everyone in your network other than your mom,
your dad and your dog. 09:48(Laughter) 09:49This is essentially what we are doing at these moments when
we need our networks the most. Imagine -- this is what we're doing.
We're doing it to ourselves. We are mentally compressing our networks when we are being harassed,
when we are being bullied, when we are threatened about losing a job, when we feel down and weak. We are closing ourselves off,
isolating ourselves, creating a blind spot where we actually
don't see our resources. We don't see our allies,
we don't see our opportunities. 10:18footnotefootnoteHow can we overcome this? Two simple strategies. One strategy is simply to look
at your list of Facebook friends and LinkedIn friends just so you remind yourself
of people who are there beyond those that
automatically come to mind. And in our own research,
one of the things we did was, we considered Claude Steele's
research on self-affirmation: simply thinking about your own values, networking from a place of strength. What Leigh Thompson, Hoon-Seok Choi
and I were able to do is, we found that people
who had affirmed themselves first were able to take advice from people who would otherwise
be threatening to them. 10:54footnotefootnoteHere's a last exercise. I want you to look in your email in-box, and I want you to look at the last time
you asked somebody for a favor. And I want you to look
at the language that you used. Did you say things like, ""Oh, you're a great resource,"" or ""I owe you one,"" ""I'm obligated to you."" All of this language
represents a metaphor. It's a metaphor of economics, of a balance sheet, of accounting, of transactions. And when we think about human relations
in a transactional way, it is fundamentally uncomfortable
to us as human beings. We must think about human relations
and reaching out to people in more humane ways. 11:35Here's an idea as to how to do so. Look at words like ""please,"" ""thank you,""
""you're welcome"" in other languages. Look at the literal
translation of these words. Each of these words is a word
that helps us impose upon other people in our social networks. And so, the word ""thank you,"" if you look at it in Spanish,
Italian, French, ""gracias,"" ""grazie,"" ""merci"" in French. Each of them are ""grace"" and ""mercy."" They are godly words. There's nothing economic
or transactional about those words. The word ""you're welcome"" is interesting. The great persuasion theorist
Robert Cialdini says we've got to get our favors back. So we need to emphasize
the transaction a little bit more. He says, ""Let's not say 'You're welcome.' Instead say, 'I know you'd
do the same for me.'"" But sometimes it may be helpful
to not think in transactional ways, to eliminate the transaction,
to make it a little bit more invisible. And in fact, if you look in Chinese, the word ""bú kè qì"" in Chinese,
""You're welcome,"" means, ""Don't be formal; we're family. We don't
need to go through those formalities."" And ""kembali"" in Indonesian
is ""Come back to me."" When you say ""You're welcome"" next time, think about how you can maybe
eliminate the transaction and instead strengthen that social tie. Maybe ""It's great to collaborate,""
or ""That's what friends are for."" 12:54footnotefootnoteI want you to think about how
you think about this ticket that you have to travel your social universe. Here's one metaphor. It's a common metaphor:
""Life is a journey."" Right? It's a train ride, and you're a passenger on the train, and there are certain people with you. Certain people get on this train, and some stay with you,
some leave at different stops, new ones may enter. I love this metaphor,
it's a beautiful one. But I want you to consider
a different metaphor. This one is passive,
being a passenger on that train, and it's quite linear. You're off to some particular destination. Why not instead think of yourself as an atom, bumping up against other atoms, maybe transferring energy with them, bonding with them a little and maybe creating something new on your travels
through the social universe. 13:44Thank you so much. And I hope we bump into each other again. 13:47(Applause)"
1,What makes a friendship last?,Mona Chalabi,Oct 2021,"Sustaining friendships -- and making new friends -- can be challenging, even when we know it's important.

And each time that I move to a new
neighborhood, a new city, a new country, it seems to get harder and harder
to sustain the friendships I left behind. But right now, sustaining those friendships
seems especially important and especially difficult. So I'm wondering what is manageable? How can I keep those friendships afloat
without getting overwhelmed? 00:22[Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi] 00:25To find out, I turned
to my two most trusted sources: data and my mum. Now, since she hates being on camera, this puppet is going to be
as good as it gets. But before she weighs in, I wanted to look at the studies
on how friendships fall apart in the hopes that I might be able
to avoid some of those pitfalls. 00:42According to one study, friendships often dissolve
because of a lack of opportunity to meet, hang out and connect. Which may explain why,
after a year of isolation, some of my friendships feel
like they're hanging on by a thread. The same researcher made headlines with the finding that we lose half
of our friendships every seven years. 01:00Now, before you start doomscrolling
through your contact list, you should know that's not quite
as severe as it sounds. Over those seven years, the size of our friendship group
actually stays pretty stable. So if you have 20 or 30 good friends now, seven years later, you still probably have
20 or 30 good friends. The catch, though, is that 52 percent
of those faces will be different. Over seven years, we will replace many of the people
in our network with new ones. 01:25As someone who has had to work
more and more from home, the opportunity to go out
and make new friends is pretty limited. It's a luxury I don't often have. And the research
on the formation of new friends suggest that this takes time. A lot of time. 01:38A recent study found that you have to spend between
40 and 60 hours with someone before they can go from
an acquaintance to a casual friend. They get upgraded
to a fully fledged friend around 80 to 100 hours, and get elevated to a best friend after you spend at least 200 hours
of quality time together. 01:58And the emphasis here is on quality time. You might say ""hi""
to a barista every morning or be polite to a coworker, but you wouldn't necessarily invite
either one over for dinner. 02:08I was feeling a little bit daunted
by all of these numbers until I spoke to my mum, who has a more optimistic
take on all of this. ""A friendship is essential in your life. How does friendship start? The first thing is to know that person. If you don't want to know these people, if you don't open a window
of communication, you will never become friends of them. You have to start. If you want to be isolated, you just shut your windows
and look at them, and they don't look at you."" 02:38OK, so yes, if I really, really
want to make a new friendship, I could go out and make the effort
to make a new friend by, say, knocking on my neighbor's door, who plays really good music
a bit too loudly. But what about my current
group of friends? Are we all doomed just
because we don't get the chance to hang out like we used to? 02:56""I think yes, with the friends, the distance gets further and further
if you are not meeting them. But it also shows you the ones that don't disappear
because of the time or the distance. They will be there for you
if you need them. So the special friends. And this difficult time
shows you who cares and who is a good person
or a good friend."" 03:24I think she's right. I don't think there's a magical formula or a mythical number of hours to chase. This just takes time and effort. So if you'll excuse me, I have a good friend that I need to call."
1,What makes life worth living in the face of death,Lucy Kalanithi,May 2017,"In this deeply moving talk, Lucy Kalanithi reflects on life and purpose, sharing the story of her late husband, Paul, a young neurosurgeon who turned to writing after his terminal cancer diagnosis. ""Engaging in the full range of experience -- living and dying, love and loss -- is what we get to do,"" Kalanithi says. ""Being human doesn't happen despite suffering -- it happens within it.""", (75K),"Transcript (22 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00A few days after my husband Paul
was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, we were lying in our bed at home, and Paul said, ""It's going to be OK."" And I remember answering back, ""Yes. We just don't know what OK means yet."" 00:23Paul and I had met as first-year
medical students at Yale. He was smart and kind and super funny. He used to keep a gorilla suit
in the trunk of his car, and he'd say, ""It's for emergencies only."" 00:37(Laughter) 00:39I fell in love with Paul as I watched
the care he took with his patients. He stayed late talking with them, seeking to understand
the experience of illness and not just its technicalities. He later told me he fell in love with me when he saw me cry over an EKG
of a heart that had ceased beating. We didn't know it yet, but even in the heady days of young love, we were learning how
to approach suffering together. 01:10We got married and became doctors. I was working as an internist and Paul was finishing his training
as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight. He developed excruciating back pain
and a cough that wouldn't go away. And when he was admitted to the hospital, a CT scan revealed tumors
in Paul's lungs and in his bones. We had both cared for patients
with devastating diagnoses; now it was our turn. 01:46We lived with Paul's illness
for 22 months. He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. I gave birth to our daughter Cady, and we loved her and each other. We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions. The day we took Paul
into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life. When he turned to me at the end and said, ""I'm ready,"" I knew that wasn't just a brave decision. It was the right one. Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR. In that moment, the most important thing to Paul was to hold our baby daughter. Nine hours later, Paul died. 02:43I've always thought of myself
as a caregiver -- most physicians do -- and taking care of Paul
deepened what that meant. Watching him reshape
his identity during his illness, learning to witness and accept his pain, talking together through his choices -- those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean
bouncing back to where you were before, or pretending that
the hard stuff isn't hard. It is so hard. It's painful, messy stuff. But it's the stuff. And I learned that when we
approach it together, we get to decide what success looks like. 03:31One of the first things
Paul said to me after his diagnosis was, ""I want you to get remarried."" And I was like, whoa, I guess
we get to say anything out loud. 03:41(Laughter) 03:44It was so shocking and heartbreaking ... and generous, and really comforting because it was so starkly honest, and that honesty turned out
to be exactly what we needed. Early in Paul's illness, we agreed we would
just keep saying things out loud. Tasks like making a will, or completing our advance directives -- tasks that I had always avoided -- were not as daunting as they once seemed. I realized that completing
an advance directive is an act of love -- like a wedding vow. A pact to take care of someone, codifying the promise that til death do us part, I will be there. If needed, I will speak for you. I will honor your wishes. That paperwork became
a tangible part of our love story. 04:47As physicians, Paul and I were in a good position to understand and even
accept his diagnosis. We weren't angry about it, luckily, because we'd seen so many patients
in devastating situations, and we knew that death is a part of life. But it's one thing to know that; it was a very different experience to actually live with the sadness
and uncertainty of a serious illness. Huge strides are being made
against lung cancer, but we knew that Paul likely had
months to a few years left to live. 05:24During that time, Paul wrote about his transition
from doctor to patient. He talked about feeling
like he was suddenly at a crossroads, and how he would have thought
he'd be able to see the path, that because he treated so many patients, maybe he could follow in their footsteps. But he was totally disoriented. Rather than a path, Paul wrote, ""I saw instead only a harsh, vacant,
gleaming white desert. As if a sandstorm
had erased all familiarity. I had to face my mortality and try to understand
what made my life worth living, and I needed my oncologist's
help to do so."" 06:15The clinicians taking care of Paul gave me an even deeper appreciation
for my colleagues in health care. We have a tough job. We're responsible for helping patients
have clarity around their prognoses and their treatment options, and that's never easy,
but it's especially tough when you're dealing with potentially
terminal illnesses like cancer. Some people don't want to know
how long they have left, others do. Either way, we never have those answers. Sometimes we substitute hope by emphasizing the best-case scenario. In a survey of physicians, 55 percent said
they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patient's prognosis. It's an instinct born out of kindness. But researchers have found that when people better understand
the possible outcomes of an illness, they have less anxiety, greater ability to plan and less trauma for their families. 07:28Families can struggle
with those conversations, but for us, we also found that information
immensely helpful with big decisions. Most notably, whether to have a baby. Months to a few years meant
Paul was not likely to see her grow up. But he had a good chance
of being there for her birth and for the beginning of her life. I remember asking Paul if he thought having
to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful. And his answer astounded me. He said, ""Wouldn't it be great if it did?"" And we did it. Not in order to spite cancer, but because we were learning that living fully
means accepting suffering. 08:31Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue
working as a neurosurgeon, which initially we thought
was totally impossible. When the cancer advanced and Paul shifted from surgery to writing, his palliative care doctor
prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused. They asked Paul about
his priorities and his worries. They asked him what trade-offs
he was willing to make. Those conversations
are the best way to ensure that your health care matches your values. Paul joked that it's not
like that ""birds and bees"" talk you have with your parents, where you all get it over with
as quickly as possible, and then pretend it never happened. You revisit the conversation
as things change. You keep saying things out loud. I'm forever grateful because Paul's clinicians felt that their job wasn't to try
to give us answers they didn't have, or only to try to fix things for us, but to counsel Paul
through painful choices ... when his body was failing
but his will to live wasn't. 09:49Later, after Paul died, I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, but I sent just one ... to Paul's oncologist, because she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices. She knew that living
means more than just staying alive. 10:13A few weeks ago,
a patient came into my clinic. A woman dealing
with a serious chronic disease. And while we were talking
about her life and her health care, she said, ""I love my palliative care team. They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."" Yeah, I thought, of course it is. But many patients don't feel that. Compassion and Choices did a study where they asked people
about their health care preferences. And a lot of people
started their answers with the words ""Well, if I had a choice ..."" If I had a choice. And when I read that ""if,"" I understood better why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted
medical treatment, or watches a family member receive
excessive or unwanted medical treatment. It's not because doctors don't get it. We do. We understand the real
psychological consequences on patients and their families. The things is, we deal with them, too. Half of critical care nurses
and a quarter of ICU doctors have considered quitting their jobs because of distress over feeling
that for some of their patients, they've provided care
that didn't fit with the person's values. But doctors can't make sure
your wishes are respected until they know what they are. 11:52Would you want to be on life support
if it offered any chance of longer life? Are you most worried
about the quality of that time, rather than quantity? Both of those choices
are thoughtful and brave, but for all of us, it's our choice. That's true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives. If you're pregnant,
do you want genetic screening? Is a knee replacement right or not? Do you want to do dialysis
in a clinic or at home? The answer is: it depends. What medical care will help you
live the way you want to? I hope you remember that question the next time you face
a decision in your health care. Remember that you always have a choice, and it is OK to say no to a treatment
that's not right for you. 12:54There's a poem by W.S. Merwin -- it's just two sentences long -- that captures how I feel now. ""Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle. Everything I do
is stitched with its color."" For me that poem evokes my love for Paul, and a new fortitude that came from loving and losing him. 13:28When Paul said, ""It's going to be OK,"" that didn't mean
that we could cure his illness. Instead, we learned to accept
both joy and sadness at the same time; to uncover beauty and purpose both despite and because we are all born and we all die. And for all the sadness
and sleepless nights, it turns out there is joy. I leave flowers on Paul's grave and watch our two-year-old
run around on the grass. I build bonfires on the beach
and watch the sunset with our friends. Exercise and mindfulness
meditation have helped a lot. And someday, I hope I do get remarried. 14:24Most importantly,
I get to watch our daughter grow. I've thought a lot
about what I'm going to say to her when she's older. ""Cady, engaging in the full
range of experience -- living and dying, love and loss -- is what we get to do. Being human doesn't happen
despite suffering. It happens within it. When we approach suffering together, when we choose not to hide from it, our lives don't diminish, they expand."" 15:09I've learned that cancer
isn't always a battle. Or if it is, maybe it's a fight for something
different than we thought. Our job isn't to fight fate, but to help each other through. Not as soldiers but as shepherds. That's how we make it OK, even when it's not. By saying it out loud, by helping each other through ... and a gorilla suit never hurts, either. 15:48Thank you. 15:49(Applause)"
1,Why US laws must expand beyond the nuclear family,Diana Adams,Mar 2022,"The nuclear family model may no longer be the norm in the US, but it's still the basis for social and economic benefits like health care, tax breaks and citizenship. Lawyer and LBGTQIA advocate Diana Adams believes that all families, regardless of biological relationship or legal marriage, are deserving of equal legal rights and recognition. They present a vision for how US laws can benefit all families -- from same-sex bonds to multi-parent partnerships -- and explain how a more ...", (57K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (繁體)00:01Growing up in a working-class town
in upstate New York, I was taught to hope for a future
with a husband and two kids. How about you? I saw women in my community
marry as a path to economic security but often end up with discontent
and even abuse instead. As I got older, I came to wonder and I ask you now: What is family? What do we want family to be? 00:36The nuclear family has been the basis
for our cultural stories and our laws. But only about half
of US adults are married. Fewer every year. Forty percent of US adults
don't live with a romantic partner at all. As of 2013, less than half of US children
had two married heterosexual parents in their first marriage. The majority of us are not in a nuclear
family with a spouse and kids. Yet somehow, we treat this majority of people
like social failures. What’s worse: our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens. Marriage comes with over 1,000 rights
and benefits under federal law. These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship, share health insurance,
get better tax rates and inherit tax-free at death and more. Part of the winning argument
for same-sex marriage was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits. But I ask you, why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship of which some people disapprove? Or because they're single. 02:00(Applause) 02:01Thank you. 02:03Or because they're basing family on something other
than a romantic relationship, like co-parenting a child. Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form and value all families as they exist. 02:18(Applause) 02:22That's what I've dedicated my career to, and today, I'll share some of my visions for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families, but also how an expansive view of family will strengthen all
of your own relationships. 02:36For nearly 15 years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and non-nuclear families, I've supported same sex couples. But also the many family
forms beyond marriage, like platonic partners
who are raising a child together or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship. Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren. Or a lesbian couple
co-parenting with a male friend. Or polyamorous partners who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four. Within that legal advocacy, I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned and then help them design
their own family agreements. With the non-profit
organization I founded, Chosen Family Law Center, I advocate for changes in US laws to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations. And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family, actively discussing
how we intend to live together is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships. 03:40So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family? Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks and 38 percent of the world
population does today. The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development. It emerged in the industrial revolution to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom. It peaked in the 1950s and '60s, but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since. Still, somehow, it's the basis
for our health insurance system. How well is that working out? And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country. We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind. In Western Europe, where I live,
and in many other countries, states provide support
for citizens in need, including parents who are home
with young children, such as paid maternity leave and financial support throughout
the childhood, if needed. But in US law, we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses rather than between citizen and state. US marriage is a social
welfare state of two. I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally. This leaves many people, especially women, stuck in unhealthy relationships. So at this point, we can evaluate how same-sex partnership, when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage, there was really an emphasis on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage, or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried. And we can do both. It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people and other kinds of family constellations. 05:32(Applause) 05:36Because the reality is,
there's no evidence that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one. Research has consistently shown that children need stability
of parental figures. But from what I've consistently found, it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad, two dads, mom and grandma or three polyamorous partners. So this is not only about justice. This is about what's best for children. If we really want that stability for kids, we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in, rather than try and fail to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits. It's time to observe
what's not working and change course. 06:19My definition of family is people who are committed
to be there for each other, no matter what. This includes chosen family regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage. Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles with no blood relation, but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved. Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family when they're rejected
by their family of origin or when wanting to create
families that share their values. I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family. I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town, the only child of wonderful older parents. When I came out as bisexual, then as polyamorous,
then as gender non-binary, most of my blood relations
and over 30 cousins stopped talking to me. That's pretty standard. When I was a broke 20-something
starting my law practice, I was diagnosed with cervical cancer. And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance that didn't cover cancer. I was in a desperate,
life-threatening situation. And while my parents were loving, they couldn't provide me
with material support or problem-solving. So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment about asking for help. And I reached out
to my communities of friends. And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another. They made a schedule, so there was always
someone there to cook, to clean, to make phone calls
about my health coverage or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear. When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program, the administrator called and said, ""I don't know who you are,
but a lot of people love you."" 08:12(Applause) 08:19And then she said, ""And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now, please. Let them know you got coverage, it's done. Thank you."" 08:26(Laughter) 08:28The chosen family who stepped up for me probably saved my life. But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me. Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage often don't get those rights. And since then, my life's work
has been to change that and I will. 08:46(Applause and cheers) 08:51When we embrace the idea of chosen family, our own free will is more important
than biological connection. We can choose to create
family relationships with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support that we need and deserve. 09:07Same-sex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology, because in a same sex couple, only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg. In my family-building legal work
with these families, I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned before designing that legal agreement. For example, I’ll often work with a female
same-sex couple who has a male friend
who wants to ""help"" them become parents. So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear on whether he's going to be
a co-parent or a sperm donor and design a legal agreement either way. Without that, I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity. Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision she doesn't want his input on. He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park, but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes, you know? When we're designing our own families, we need clear written agreements, especially if children are involved. 10:07Let's say I have two clients,
Sharon and Bill, best friends who are considering
becoming co-parents. Sharon's turned 40 and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids. Neither has her gay bestie Bill, who can’t afford the $100,000
surrogacy process by himself. So they call each other their Plan B. I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values, their plans to share
finances for the child, their ideal week of childcare split. But the conversation
often gets more difficult when I ask questions like, ""Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next 18 years to each be near the child?"" We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse and saying ""no"" to a dream job
in a different city to stay close to each other. But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy. But by becoming co-parenting partners, they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends to platonic partners. They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy and welcome and embrace a new reality of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their long-term friendship and agree that this co-parenting
relationship will come first. I have found in my work that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be. We need to have these conversations. Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye and coming to agreement. But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that. 11:40When I design relationships for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four, I sometimes use existing legal structures like trusts or LLCs, that allow you to share
property and finances without a question
as to your relationship. So, for example, if I've got
a polyamorous triad Ayesha, Susan and Linda, I can set up an LLC for them so that they can co-own
real estate properties, pay taxes together, purchase a common health insurance and have clear
exit strategies if they wish. 12:10(Applause) 12:15And if people trust each other enough to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together, it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners, siblings or romantic partners. All of those families are valid. 12:27(Applause) 12:28Thank you. 12:30We should be able to choose legal partners beyond a single romantic
partner, like a spouse. Some people are doing that now, and it's the trend for the future. Domestic partnerships have been used
for 30 years by same-sex couples, but also by best friends and siblings. Doing so, as domestic partners,
allows you to share your health insurance to visit each other in the hospital and across borders
in a pandemic, like spouses. But unlike spouses, you don't become
a social welfare state of two, which can be a good thing. I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister. By becoming domestic partners, she was able to put her sister on her excellent
health insurance coverage. Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend? Right? Thank you. 13:23(Applause) 13:24We've built on that history. In 2020, my organization
helped pass the first laws for multi-partner domestic partnership, which have passed
in several cities and counting. This means that three
or four polyamorous partners could become domestic partners or two or more platonic co-parents or any two, three or four people who want to become
each other's legal partners. When relationships
have legal status like this, it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness, as we saw in the same-sex
partnership movement. Still, we hope this year to pass the first family status
nondiscrimination laws at city levels across the United States, which means that you
can't be discriminated against, you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing because of your family configuration. 14:11(Applause) 14:15In future, I propose that we move from these
city-level domestic partnerships to state-level multi-partner
domestic partnerships and then federal recognition, as we did with same-sex marriage. And if we really want
to value families as they exist rather than incentivize marriage, I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship that passes muster. 14:46And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore. That time is done. And marriages will be stronger
when we do that. Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have for health insurance or citizenship? Because I know too many,
and I’m a divorce lawyer. 15:04(Laughter) 15:06As a divorce lawyer,
relationships last longer when we marry for better reasons
than government perks. So, many of you may be married and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you. But I ask you to reflect. Could your relationship be stronger if you adopted a more
expansive view of family? Marriage and partnership
are not one-size-fits-all. Every couple in partnership benefits from actively deciding how they want
to co-create together in terms of co-parenting, shared finances, your household and your definition of monogamy. For example, is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed? I bet there is. Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in just because everyone does it, like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together, that just isn't really working
for your partnership? When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs, we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship. And whether it's your romantic partner,
your parent, your adult child, your relationship may be stronger if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met. 16:27(Applause) 16:32My husband does not want
to help me process. I have other people for that in my life. So ... I think it's worthwhile to question, no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in, whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home. Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do. 16:58Is there a long-term friend
that you could reach out to with whom you'd like to be better in touch and suggest a regular date
for a special time together? Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community? Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life whose home you could spend more time in? 17:23At some point in a long life, you too will need support. And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now and actively caring
for people in community who may one day care for you. A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours. 17:40(Audience murmurs and laughs) 17:42Sorry. It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship. And in my vision for the future, while we work together
to redefine family in law, we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives. There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask: Do you want to make family with me? 18:04Thank you. (Applause)"

I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Jomny. That's ""Jonny"" but spelled
accidentally with an ""m,"" in case you were wondering, because we're not all perfect. 00:13footnotefootnoteJomny is an alien who has been sent to earth
with a mission to study humans. Jomny is feeling lost and alone
and far from home, and I think we've all felt this way. Or, at least I have. I wrote this story about this alien
at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien. I had just moved to Cambridge
and started my doctoral program at MIT, and I was feeling intimidated and isolated
and very much like I didn't belong. 00:41But I had a lifeline of sorts. See, I was writing jokes
for years and years and sharing them on social media, and I found that I was turning
to doing this more and more. 00:54footnotefootnoteNow, for many people,
the internet can feel like a lonely place. It can feel like this, a big, endless, expansive void where you can constantly call out to it
but no one's ever listening. But I actually found a comfort
in speaking out to the void. I found, in sharing
my feelings with the void, eventually the void started to speak back. And it turns out that the void
isn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of
all sorts of other people, also staring out into it
and also wanting to be heard. Now, there have been many bad things
that have come from social media. I'm not trying to dispute that at all. To be online at any given point
is to feel so much sadness and anger and violence. It can feel like the end of the world. Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted because I can't deny the fact
that so many of my closest friends are people that I had met
originally online. And I think that's partly because
there's this confessional nature to social media. It can feel like you are writing
in this personal, intimate diary that's completely private, yet at the same time you want
everyone in the world to read it. And I think part of that, the joy of that is that we get to experience things
from perspectives from people who are completely
different from ourselves, and sometimes that's a nice thing. 02:12footnotefootnoteFor example, when I first joined Twitter, I found that so many of the people
that I was following were talking about mental health
and going to therapy in ways that had none of the stigma
that they often do when we talk about these issues in person. Through them, the conversation
around mental health was normalized, and they helped me realize
that going to therapy was something that would help me as well. 02:34Now, for many people, it sounds like a scary idea
to be talking about all these topics so publicly and so openly on the internet. I feel like a lot of people
think that it is a big, scary thing to be online if you're not
already perfectly and fully formed. But I think the internet can be
actually a great place to not know, and I think we can
treat that with excitement, because to me there's something
important about sharing your imperfections and your insecurities
and your vulnerabilities with other people. 03:10(Laughter) 03:11footnotefootnoteNow, when someone shares
that they feel sad or afraid or alone, for example, it actually makes me feel less alone, not by getting rid of any of my loneliness but by showing me that I am not alone in feeling lonely. And as a writer and as an artist, I care very much about making
this comfort of being vulnerable a communal thing, something that we
can share with each other. I'm excited about
externalizing the internal, about taking those invisible personal
feelings that I don't have words for, holding them to the light,
putting words to them, and then sharing them with other people in the hopes that it might help them
find words to find their feelings as well. 03:50footnotefootnoteNow, I know that sounds like a big thing, but ultimately I'm interested
in putting all these things into small, approachable packages, because when we can hide them
into these smaller pieces, I think they are easier to approach,
I think they're more fun. I think they can more easily help us
see our shared humanness. Sometimes that takes the form
of a short story, sometimes that takes the form of
a cute book of illustrations, for example. And sometimes that takes the form of a silly joke
that I'll throw on the internet. For example, a few months ago,
I posted this app idea for a dog-walking service where a dog shows up at your door
and you have to get out of the house and go for a walk. 04:27(Laughter) 04:30If there are app developers
in the audience, please find me after the talk. 04:34Or, I like to share every time
I feel anxious about sending an email. When I sign my emails ""Best,"" it's short for ""I am trying my best,"" which is short for ""Please don't hate me,
I promise I'm trying my best!"" 04:46Or my answer to the classic icebreaker, if I could have dinner with anyone,
dead or alive, I would. I am very lonely. 04:53(Laughter) 04:57And I find that when
I post things like these online, the reaction is very similar. People come together to share a laugh, to share in that feeling, and then to disburse just as quickly. 05:08(Laughter) 05:10Yes, leaving me once again alone. But I think sometimes these
little gatherings can be quite meaningful. 05:18footnotefootnoteFor example, when I graduated
from architecture school and I moved to Cambridge, I posted this question: ""How many people in your life
have you already had your last conversation with?"" And I was thinking about
my own friends who had moved away to different cities
and different countries, even, and how hard it would be
for me to keep in touch with them. But other people started replying
and sharing their own experiences. Somebody talked about a family member
they had a falling out with. Someone talked about a loved one
who had passed away quickly and unexpectedly. Someone else talked
about their friends from school who had moved away as well. But then something really nice
started happening. Instead of just replying to me, people started replying to each other, and they started to talk to each other
and share their own experiences and comfort each other and encourage each other
to reach out to that friend that they hadn't spoken to in a while or that family member
that they had a falling out with. And eventually, we got
this little tiny microcommunity. It felt like this support group formed of all sorts of people coming together. And I think every time we post online, every time we do this, there's a chance that these little
microcommunities can form. There's a chance that all sorts
of different creatures can come together and be drawn together. And sometimes, through
the muck of the internet, you get to find a kindred spirit. Sometimes that's
in the reading the replies and the comments sections and finding
a reply that is particularly kind or insightful or funny. Sometimes that's
in going to follow someone and seeing that they
already follow you back. And sometimes that's in looking at someone
that you know in real life and seeing the things that you write
and the things that they write and realizing that you share so many
of the same interests as they do, and that brings them
closer together to you. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you get to meet another alien. 07:12[when two aliebns find each other
in a strange place, it feels a litle more like home] 07:17footnotefootnoteBut I am worried, too,
because as we all know, the internet for the most part
doesn't feel like this. We all know that for the most part, the internet feels like a place
where we misunderstand each other, where we come into conflict
with each other, where there's all sorts of confusion
and screaming and yelling and shouting, and it feels like
there's too much of everything. It feels like chaos, and I don't know how to square away
the bad parts with the good, because as we know and as we've seen, the bad parts can really, really hurt us. It feels to me that the platforms
that we use to inhabit these online spaces have been designed
either ignorantly or willfully to allow for harassment and abuse,
to propagate misinformation, to enable hatred and hate speech
and the violence that comes from it, and it feels like
none of our current platforms are doing enough
to address and to fix that. 08:12But still, and maybe
probably unfortunately, I'm still drawn to these online spaces,
as many others are, because sometimes it just feels
like that's where all the people are. And I feel silly and stupid sometimes for valuing these small moments
of human connection in times like these. But I've always operated under this idea that these little moments of humanness
are not superfluous. They're not retreats
from the world at all, but instead they're the reasons
why we come to these spaces. They are important and vital
and they affirm and they give us life. And they are these tiny,
temporary sanctuaries that show us that we are not
as alone as we think we are. And so yes, even though life is bad
and everyone's sad and one day we're all going to die -- 09:03[look. life is bad. everyones sad. We're all gona die, but i alredy bought
this inflatable bouncey castle so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not] 09:10footnotefootnoteI think the inflatable metaphorical
bouncy castle in this case is really our relationships
and our connections to other people. 09:22footnotefootnoteAnd so one night, when I was feeling particularly sad
and hopeless about the world, I shouted out to the void, to the lonely darkness. I said, ""At this point,
logging on to social media feels like holding someone's hand
at the end of the world."" And this time, instead of
the void responding, it was people who showed up, who started replying to me and then
who started talking to each other, and slowly this little
tiny community formed. Everybody came together to hold hands. 09:51And in these dangerous and unsure times, in the midst of it all, I think the thing that we have
to hold on to is other people. And I know that is a small thing
made up of small moments, but I think it is one tiny,
tiny sliver of light in all the darkness. 10:12Thank you. 10:13(Applause) 10:18Thank you. 10:19(Applause)"

Some are all-encompassing. It conquers all. It's all you need. It's all there is. These are all comparisons, though, ways of defining it by contrast, by saying it's more important than all other things, but is it? Sure, love matters more than your standard turkey sandwich, but does it matter more than shelter? Or sanity? Or an exceptional turkey sandwich? No matter your answer, you're just ranking it, not defining it. Another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it. Would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency? Or, I don't know, ask a guy to define bears while he's fending them off? Or is romance not like winning the lottery? Are break ups not like bear attacks? Bad comparisons? That's my point. I'm not thinking right because I'm in love, so ha! Taking a step back, or taking a cold shower, whatever, love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history. And despite centuries upon centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us. Some say it's a feeling, a magical emotion, a feeling for someone like you've never felt before. But feelings are fluid, not very concrete foundation for a definition. Sometimes you hate the person you love. Plus, come on, you've felt feelings like it before, sort of in miniature. Your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners. And your love for your partner may be in its own dynamic relationship, healthy or totally weird, with the love of your parents and siblings. Love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling: Holding hands, kissing, hugging, public displays of affection, dating, marriage, having kids, or just sex. But these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative. You may love or be someone who can't have kids or doesn't want to, who believes in marriage but also in divorce, who's from a culture where people don't really date the way we think of dating, or who just doesn't want to make out on the bus. But if love is a thing that we can define, then how can it mean opposite things for so many people? So, maybe love's just all in your head, a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards in your nervous system. Perhaps these rewards are addictive. Perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person, just like a person can be addicted to a drug. I don't mean to be edgy like some pop song. Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person can make you develop a habit for that person. The person comes to satisfy a physiological craving, and you want more. But then sometimes, slowly or suddenly, you don't. You've fallen out of love, become unaddicted, for a spell. What happened? Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit? Why do some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives? Perhaps to create new lives, to proliferate their species? Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method for bringing about its own replication. There are evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior, from how we display ourselves to potential mates, to how we treat each other in relationships, to how we raise kids. Thus, some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species. Nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties, just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys, and biology marches on. But is that all love is? Or, perhaps worse, is it just a construct, some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose? Maybe it is a construct, but let's be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality: Our experiences, feelings, brain chemistry, cultural expectations, our lives. And this edifice can be viewed through countless dimensions: scientific, emotional, historical, spiritual, legal, or just personal. If no two people are the same, no two people's love is the same either. So, in every loving relationship, there's a lot to talk about and partners should be open to that, or the relationship probably won't last. Love is always up for discussion and, sure, under construction. So, if we can't define it, that's a good sign. It means we're all still making it. Wait, I didn't mean, you know what I meant."
3,Why do we love? A philosophical inquiry,Skye C. Cleary,Feb 2016,"Ah, romantic love; beautiful and intoxicating, heart-breaking and soul-crushing... often all at the same time!

Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer? Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering? Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology
to make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete. In his ""Symposium"",
he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests 
with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love 
based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining
the species and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path, a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels, ""Dream of the Red Chamber."" In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it. But of course, 
he looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments
spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir
 proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives
with meaning. However, she was less 
concerned with why we love and more interested 
in how we can love better. She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives
and the world together. Though we might never know
why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be 
the best thing in life. Will you dare to find out?"
3,The uncomplicated truth about women's sexuality,Sarah Barmak,Feb 2019,"Is women's sexuality more complicated than men's? Well, not really, no, says author Sarah Barmak. In this frank, eye-opening talk, she shows how a flawed understanding of the female body has shaped this discussion for centuries. She debunks some age-old myths (you're welcome) and offers a richer definition of pleasure that gets closer to the simple truth about women's sexuality.", (77K),"Transcript (24 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00In our culture we tend to see sex as something that's more important
to men than it is to women. But that's not true. What is true is that women often feel
more shame in talking about it. Over half of women quietly suffer
from some kind of sexual dysfunction. We've been hearing
more about the orgasm gap. It's kind of like the wage gap
but stickier ... 00:26(Laughter) 00:30footnotefootnoteStraight women tend to reach climax less than 60 percent
of the time they have sex. Men reach climax 90 percent
of the time they have sex. To address these issues,
women have been sold flawed medication, testosterone creams ... even untested genital injections. 00:52footnotefootnoteThe thing is, female sexuality
can't be fixed with a pill. That's because it's not broken: it's misunderstood. Our culture has had a skewed
and medically incorrect picture of female sexuality going back centuries. If over half of women
have some kind of sexual problem, maybe our idea of sexuality
doesn't work for women. We need a clearer understanding
of how women actually work. 01:26footnotefootnoteI'm a journalist, and I recently wrote a book about how our understanding
of female sexuality is evolving. So sexuality itself was defined
back when men dominated science. Male scientists
tended to see the female body through their own skewed lens. They could've just asked women
about their experience. Instead they probed the female body
like it was a foreign landscape. Even today we debate the existence
of female ejaculation and the G-spot like we're talking about aliens or UFOs. ""Are they really out there?"" 02:07(Laughter) 02:10All this goes double for LGBTQI
women's sexuality, which has been hated
and erased in specific ways. 02:18footnotefootnoteIgnorance about the female body
goes back centuries. It goes back to the beginning
of modern medicine. Cast your mind back to the 16th century, a time of scientific revolution in Europe. Men of ideas were challenging old dogmas. They were building telescopes
to gaze up at the stars. We were making progress ... sometimes. You see, the fathers of anatomy -- and I say ""fathers"" because,
let's face it, they were all dudes -- were poking about between women's legs and trying to classify what they saw. They weren't quite sure
what to do with the clitoris. It didn't appear to have
anything to do with making babies. The leading anatomist at the time declared that it was probably
some kind of abnormal growth -- 03:13(Laughter) 03:14and that any woman who had one
was probably a hermaphrodite. It got so bad that parents would sometimes
have their daughter's clitoris cut off if it was deemed too large. That's right. Something we think of today
as female genital mutilation was practiced in the West
as late as the 20th century. You have to wonder: if they were that confused
about women's bodies, why didn't they just ask women
for a little help? 03:46But you must be thinking,
""All that was history. It's a different world now. Women have everything. They have the birth control pill, they have sexting
and Tinder and vajazzling."" 04:00(Laughter) 04:03Things must be better now. But medical ignorance
of the female body continues. How many of you recognize this? It's the full structure of the clitoris. We think of the clitoris
as this little pea-sized nub, but actually it extends
deep into the body. Most of it lies under the skin. It contains almost as much
erectile tissue as the penis. It's beautiful, isn't it? It looks a little like a swan. 04:37(Laughter) 04:39This sculpture is by an artist
named Sophia Wallace as part of her ""Cliteracy"" project. 04:46(Laughter) 04:47She believes we need more ""cliteracy,"" and it's true, considering
that this structure was only fully 3-D mapped
by researchers in 2009. That was after we finished mapping
the entire human genome. 05:03(Laughter) 05:08This ignorance has real-life consequences. In a medical journal in 2005, Dr. Helen O'Connell, a urologist, warned her colleagues that this structure
was still nowhere to be found in basic medical journals -- textbooks like ""Gray's Anatomy."" This could have serious
consequences for surgery. 05:31footnotefootnoteTake this in. Gentlemen: imagine if you were at risk
of losing your penis because doctors weren't
totally sure where it was or what it looked like. Unsurprisingly, many women aren't too clear
on their own genital anatomy either. You can't really blame them. The clitoris is often missing
from many sex-ed diagrams, too. Women can sense that their culture
views their bodies with confusion at best, outright disdain and disgust at worst. Many women still view their own genitals
as dirty or inadequate. They're increasingly
comparing their vulvas with the neat and tiny ones
they see in pornography. It's one reason why labiaplasty
is becoming a skyrocketing business among women and teen girls. 06:29Some people feel
that all this is a trivial issue. I was writing my book
when I was at a dinner party and someone said, ""Isn't sexuality
a first-world problem? Aren't women dealing with more
important issues all over the world?"" Of course they are. But I think the impulse to trivialize sex
is part of our problem. We live in a culture
that seems obsessed with sex. We use it to sell everything. We tell women that looking sexy is one of the most important
things you can do. But what we really do is we belittle sex. We reduce it to a sad shadow
of what it truly is. Sex is more than just an act. 07:17I spoke with Dr. Lori Brotto, a psychologist who treats
sexual issues in women, including survivors of trauma. She says the hundreds of women she sees
all tend to repeat the same thing. They say, ""I don't feel whole."" They feel they've lost a connection
with their partners and themselves. 07:40So what is sex? We've traditionally defined the act of sex as a linear, goal-oriented process. It's something that starts with lust, continues to heavy petting and finishes with a happy ending. Except many women
don't experience it this way. It's less linear for them
and more circular. This is a new model
of women's arousal and desire developed by Dr. Rosemary Basson. It says many things, including that women can begin
an encounter for many different reasons that aren't desire, like curiosity. They can finish with a climax
or multiple climaxes, or satisfaction without a climax at all. All options are normal. 08:40Some people are starting to champion
a richer definition of sexuality. Whether you identify as male,
female or neither gender, sex is about our relationship
to the senses. It's about slowing down, listening to the body, coming into the present moment. It's about our whole health
and well-being. In other words, sex at its true breadth isn't profane, it's sacred. 09:16That's one reason why women
are redefining their sexuality today. They're asking: What is sex for me? So they're experimenting with practices
that are less about the happy ending -- more about feeling whole. So they're trying out
spiritual sex classes, masturbation workshops -- even shooting their own porn that celebrates the diversity
of real bodies. 09:46For anyone who still feels
this is a trivial issue, consider this: understanding your body
is crucial to the huge issue of sex education and consent. By deeply, intimately knowing
what kind of touch feels right, what pressure, what speed, what context, you can better know
what kind of touch feels wrong and have the confidence to say so. 10:13This isn't ultimately about women
having more or better sex. It's not about making sure
women have as many orgasms as men. It's about accepting yourself
and your own unique experience. It's about you being
the expert on your body. It's about defining pleasure
and satisfaction on your terms. And if that means you're happiest
having no sex at all, that's perfect, too. 10:45If we define sex as part
of our whole health and well-being, then empowering women
and girls to fully own it is a crucial next step toward equality. And I think it would be
a better world not just for women but for everyone. 11:02Thank you. 11:04(Applause)"
3,How to raise kids who can overcome anxiety,Anne Marie Albano,May 2020,"Growing up means facing new challenges -- but for some kids, uncertain situations lead to anxiety that parents often seek to soothe. Psychologist Anne Marie Albano explains how constantly rushing to fix a child's problems can perpetuate a lifelong cycle of dependence and resentment -- and shares why a healthy dose of risk helps kids cultivate lasting confidence.", (16K),"Transcript (26 Languages)CatalàDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01As a child, I had many fears. I was afraid of lightning, insects, loud noises and costumed characters. I also had two very severe phobias of doctors and injections. During my struggles to escape
from our family doctor, I would become so physically combative that he actually slapped me
in the face to stun me. I was six. I was all fight-or-flight back then, and holding me down for a simple vaccine
took three or four adults, including my parents. 00:37Later, our family moved
from New York to Florida just as I was starting high school, and being the new kid
at the parochial school, not knowing anyone and being worried about fitting in, on the very first day of school, a teacher takes roll and calls out
""Anne Marie Albano,"" to which I respond,
[In a Staten Island accent] ""Here!"" She laughs and says,
""Oh, precious, stand up. Say D-O-G."" And I respond,
[In a Staten Island accent] ""Dog?"" The class broke out in laughter
along with the teacher. And so it went, because she had many more words
to humiliate me with. 01:17I went home sobbing, distraught and begging to be sent back to New York or to some nunnery. I did not want to go back
to that school again. No way. 01:29My parents listened and told me that they would investigate
with the monsignor back in New York, but that I had to keep going in each day
so I'd have the attendance record to transfer to ninth grade
on Staten Island. All of this was before
email and cell phones, so over the next several weeks, supposedly, there were letters being sent
between the Archdiocese of Manhattan and Miami and with the Vatican, and each day, I'd go into school crying
and come home crying, to which my mother would give me an update
from some cardinal or bishop to ""Keep her going to school
while we find her a spot."" 02:12Was I naive or what? 02:14(Laughter) 02:16Well, after a couple of weeks,
one day, while waiting for the school bus, I met a girl named Debbie, and she introduced me to her friends. And they became my friends, and, well, the Pope was off the hook. 02:30(Laughter) 02:31I began to calm down and settle in. 02:35footnotefootnoteMy past three decades
of studying anxiety in children stems partly from my own search
for self-understanding. And I've learned much. For young people, anxiety is the most
common childhood psychiatric condition. These disorders start early, by age four, and by adolescence, one in 12 youths
are severely impaired in their ability to function at home,
in school and with peers. These kids are so frightened, worried, literally physically uncomfortable
due to their anxiety. It's difficult for them
to pay attention in school, relax and have fun, make friends and do all the things
that kids should be doing. Anxiety can create misery for the child, and the parents are front and center
in witnessing their child's distress. 03:35As I met more and more children
with anxiety through my work, I had to go back to mom and dad
and ask them a couple of questions. ""Why did you hold me down when I was so frightened
of getting injections and force them on me? And why tell me these tall tales
to make me go to school when I was so worried
about being embarrassed again?"" They said, ""Our hearts
broke for you each time, but we knew that these were things
that you had to do. We had to risk you becoming upset while we waited for you
to get used to the situation with time and with more experience. You had to get vaccinated. You had to go to school."" 04:23Little did my parents know, but they were doing more
than inoculating me from the measles. They were also inoculating me
from a lifetime of anxiety disorders. Excessive anxiety in a young child
is like a superbug -- and infectious, even multiplying, such that many of the youth that I see come in with more than one anxiety
condition occurring at the same time. For example, they'll have specific phobia plus separation anxiety
plus social anxiety all together. Left untreated, anxiety in early childhood
can lead to depression by adolescence. It can also contribute
to substance abuse and to suicidality. 05:12My parents were not therapists. They didn't know any psychologists. All they knew is that these situations
may have been uncomfortable for me, but they were not harmful. My excessive anxiety would harm me
more over the long term if they let me avoid
and escape these situations and not learn how to tolerate
occasional distress. So in essence, mom and dad were doing
their own homegrown version of exposure therapy, which is the central and key component of cognitive behavioral
treatment for anxiety. 05:51My colleagues and I conducted
the largest randomized controlled study of the treatments of anxiety
in children ages seven to 17. We found that child-focused
cognitive behavioral exposure therapy or medication with a selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor are effective for
60 percent of treated youth. And their combination gets 80 percent
of kids well within three months. This is all good news. And if they stay on the medication or do monthly exposure treatments
as we did in the length of the study, they could stay well
for upwards of a year. However, after this treatment study ended, we went back and a did
a follow-up study of the participants, and we found that many of these kids
relapsed over time. And, despite the best
of evidence-based treatments, we also found that for about
40 percent of the kids with anxiety, they remained ill throughout
the course of the time. 06:57We've thought a lot about these results. What were we missing? We've hypothesized that because
we were focusing on just child-focused intervention, perhaps there's something important
about addressing the parents and involving them in treatment, too. 07:19Studies from my own lab
and from colleagues around the world have shown a consistent trend: well-meaning parents
are often inadvertently drawn into the cycle of anxiety. They give in, and they make
too many accommodations for their child, and they let their children
escape challenging situations. I want you to think about it like this: Your child comes into the house
to you crying, in tears. They're five or six years of age. ""Nobody at school likes me!
These kids are mean. No one would play with me."" How do you feel seeing
your child so upset? What do you do? The natural parenting instinct
is to comfort that child, soothe them, protect them and fix the situation. Calling the teacher to intervene
or the other parents to arrange playdates, that may be fine at age five. But what do you do if your child
keeps coming home day after day in tears? Do you still fix things for them
at age eight, 10, 14? For children, as they are developing, they invariably are going to be
encountering challenging situations: sleepovers, oral reports, a challenging test that pops up, trying out for a sports team
or a spot in the school play, conflicts with peers ... All these situations involve risk: risk of not doing well,
not getting what they want, risk of maybe making mistakes or being embarrassed. 09:01For kids with anxiety who don't take risks and engage, they then don't learn how to manage
these types of situations. Right? Because skills develop
with exposure over time, repeated exposure to everyday
situations that kids encounter: self-soothing skills or the ability to calm
oneself down when upset; problem-solving skills, including the ability
to resolve conflicts with others; delay of gratification, or the ability to keep your efforts going despite the fact that you have
to wait over time to see what happens. These and many other skills
are developing in children who take risks and engage. And self-efficacy takes shape, which, simply put,
is the belief in oneself that you can overcome
challenging situations. 10:00For kids with anxiety
who escape and avoid these situations and get other people to do them for them, they become more and more
anxious with time while less confident in themselves. Contrary to their peers
who don't suffer with anxiety, they come to believe that they are
incapable of managing these situations. They think that they need someone,
someone like their parents, to do things for them. 10:31Now, while the natural parenting instinct
is to comfort and protect and reassure kids, in 1930, the psychiatrist Alfred Adler had already cautioned parents that we can love a child
as much as we wish, but we must not make that child dependent. He advised parents to begin training kids
from the very beginning to stand on their own two feet. He also cautioned
that if children get the impression that their parents have nothing better
to do than be at their beck and call, they would gain a false idea of love. 11:13For children with anxiety
in this day and age, they are always calling their parents or texting distress calls
at all hours of the day and night. So if children with anxiety don't learn
the proper coping mechanisms when young, what happens to them when they grow up? 11:33footnotefootnoteI run groups for parents
of young adults with anxiety disorders. These youth are between
the ages of 18 and 28. They are mostly living at home, dependent on their parents. Many of them may have
attended school and college. Some have graduated. Almost all are not working, just staying at home
and not doing much of anything. They don't have meaningful
relationships with others, and they are very,
very dependent on their parents to do all sort of things for them. Their parents still make
their doctors appointments for them. They call the kids' old friends
and beg them to come visit. They do the kids' laundry
and cook for them. And they are in great conflict
with their young adult, because the anxiety has flourished
but the youth has not. These parents feel enormous guilt, but then resentment, and then more guilt. 12:36OK, how about some good news? If parents and key figures
in a child's life can help the child, assist them
to confront their fears and learn how to problem-solve, then it is more likely that the children
are going to develop their own internal coping mechanisms
for managing their anxiety. We teach parents now
to be mindful in the moment and think about their reaction
to their child's anxiety. We ask them, ""Look at the situation and ask,
'What is this situation at hand? How threatening is it to my child? And what do I ultimately
want them to learn from it?'"" 13:20Now of course, we want parents
to listen very carefully, because if a child is being bullied
seriously or put in harm's way, we want parents to intervene, absolutely. But in typical, everyday
anxiety-producing situations, parents can be
most helpful to their child if they remain calm
and matter-of-fact and warm, if they validate the child's feelings but then help the child, assist them in planning how the child
is going to manage the situation. And then -- this is key -- to actually have the child
deal with the situation themselves. 13:59Of course, it is heartbreaking
to watch a child suffer, as my parents told me years later. When you see your child suffering but you think you could swoop in
and save them from the pain of it, that's everything, right? That's what we want to do. But whether we are young or old, excessive anxiety leads us
to overestimate risk and distress while underestimating our ability to cope. We know that repeated exposure
to what we fear weakens anxiety, while building resources and resilience. 14:40My parents were on to something. Today's hyper-anxious youth
are not being helped by overly protective parenting. Calmness and confidence
are not just emotions. They are coping skills
that parents and children can learn. 14:59Thank you. 15:01(Applause)"
3,A sex therapist's secret to rediscovering your spark,Ian Kerner,Feb 2022,"Sex therapist Ian Kerner hears about a common problem from his patients: ""failure to launch,"" or the inability to build and maintain sexual momentum. What's the solution? Whether you're looking to reignite the spark in your relationship or reconnect with your own desire, Kerner shares advice on how to cultivate your erotic imagination and get back on the ""arousal runway."" (Note: This talk contains mature content.

is like having a toothache. By the time you get to the dentist,
or to me, a sex therapist, you just want to get out of pain. But what we just went through with COVID,
that was like a sexual root canal. I mean, we spent months
not changing out of our pajamas. And sometimes not showering. No wonder so many of us lost our libidos. It's not that we're not sexual people. We want to want sex. We just don't want it. 00:34footnotefootnoteIn my work with couples, one of the biggest problems I see is that sex often stalls out
before it even gets started. There’s a “failure to launch,” an inability to get going
and gain momentum. For example, one of my patients shuts down as soon as her partner starts to kiss her. Turns out, her boyfriend
in the eighth grade told her she had bad breath. Another patient of mine
is terrified of losing his erection, so much so that he avoids any situation
that could possibly lead to sex. But he tells his partner he has no desire, and he blames it on work stress. Meanwhile, he's filled with longing. He just doesn't dare show it. And so his partner
feels confused and unattractive. 01:29For some of us, there just
isn't room in our busy lives for sexual energy to emerge. There isn’t what I call the “erotic
thread” between sexual events, those moments when
we can express desire or feel desire, pivot in and out of a quick sexual charge
just for the heck of it. So, you know, it's no surprise that by the time we actually
do get around to finally having sex, too often it can feel reduced to a mundane series
of predictable behaviors, stale and drained of erotic life. So why even bother? 02:09Whenever the issue is a failure to launch, what we really need is a new way in, what I call an arousal runway. And I firmly believe that that runway needs to be in the form
of psychological arousal, not just physical. For example, we know that some women
can fantasize their way to orgasm without ever touching themselves. And men -- well, men
can just look at something sexy or think about something sexy and start to get
a strong physical reaction. That's the power of psychological arousal. So why aren't we sharing
more of it with each other? 02:50Well, in the beginning of a relationship,
we really don't need to. The newness itself is often
its own form of psychological stimuli. But as we go on, and as our sexual connection
starts to lose its vitality, that's when we need to be more deliberate
about engaging our erotic minds together. Otherwise, we might start to drift apart. We might start to fall
into a sexless relationship. Some of us might even start to cheat, which is the only way that many of us know
to get back on that arousal runway. 03:29I have rarely met a couple that doesn't understand
the importance of psychological arousal and doesn't want
more of it in the bedroom, but they often just
don't know where to begin. So I give homework assignments that emphasize two types
of psychological arousal: face to face and side by side. Face to face is things
like sharing a fantasy, role-playing a sexy scenario, engaging in sexual role-play. Activities that two people can do
just between themselves with only their imaginations. Well, that's easier said than done. With so much shame
and inhibition around sex that takes willingness, it takes vulnerability,
and it takes courage. So I often suggest starting out
with a side by side experience, something that's a little less pressured. Reading some literary erotica
aloud together, listening to a sexy podcast,
watching ethical porn. That's the kind where the performers
actually want to be there. 04:41Recently, I was working
with a heterosexual couple that needed an arousal boost. They were trying to get back into sex
after having a baby. And she especially needed help
tuning out the stressors and getting into a sexual mindset. But as a breastfeeding mom,
she felt totally touched out. So she loved the idea
of psychological arousal. She thought it would be a blast
to watch porn together. She never did anything
like that in her life. But for him, that was
something private and off limits, and he was worried that she was going
to judge him based on his tastes. So I came up with a solution. I gave them a list of ethical porn sites, and I asked them, ""Hey, how do you feel about each picking a scene or two
that you think would turn on the other?"" Well, not only was he willing to do that, it led to a fascinating and funny
follow-up conversation. He asked her, ""Why exactly
did you pick tickle torture for me?"" 05:47(Laughter) 05:48So starting side by side, it helps us get face to face. But then that face to face arousal, it needs to be more
than just putting on sexy lingerie or buying handcuffs and a blindfold. On their own, those things
are pretty inert. What makes them arousing is when they
enable us to tap into our fantasies, or what the late great sex therapist
Jack Morin called a “core erotic theme.” Sexual scenarios that uniquely
turn us on more than others, and they hold on
to that erotic charge over time. 06:31footnotefootnoteWell, a lot of couples say
they don't have fantasies or they don't know
what their fantasies are. But once you start having
those side by side experiences, those erotic themes start to emerge
and get talked about. Like the couple with the new baby. Why did she end up
picking tickle torture for him? Well, she felt like
he needed to lose control, both in and out of the bedroom, and he was very ticklish. Because she was the one who actually
had to go through the pain of childbirth, but then he made such a big deal
about being in the delivery room and having to watch and how hard it was, he needed to be punished for that. 07:15(Laughter) 07:16And because she loved the idea of just
stepping out of her nurturing mom role and for a little while
being a powerful dominatrix. I can't say they ever got as far
as actually engaging in tickle torture, but I do know that they started to move
from side by side to face to face and started to play with power
in ways that they both found really hot. 07:41So what if you are someone
who fantasizes during sex but you keep it to yourself? Does that count a psychological arousal? And what if the person
you're fantasizing about isn't the person
you're actually having sex with? That can be confusing. You might start to wonder,
""What's going on here? Am I bored? Am I not into the sex?
Am I cheating in my mind? Should I push those thoughts
out of my head?"" No. Our fantasies are our allies. They help distract us away from the chaotic world
outside of our bedroom, and they lead us and they lull us
into our sexual bodies so that we can tune in and turn on. Our fantasies are our friends. You don't fear them. You follow them. 08:44Now does that mean you should
take your partner with you and tell them about that secret fantasy? Well, that depends. It could be a great way of going deeper
into that face-to-face arousal. But on the other hand, if you and your partner
are just starting to dip your toes into the shallow end of the fantasy pool, well, then you might want to hang out in the intermediate section
a little bit, you know, like splash around a little bit,
get comfortable, develop some emotional safety, establish boundaries. I mean, maybe you got
to make it clear to your partner, ""Hey, just so we know, fantasy is fantasy
because it's not reality, right?"" There's a line between thought and action. And just because you happen to have
erotic themes that turn you on and that include others, that doesn't mean that the sex
isn't still just about the two of you. 09:44A bunch of years ago, I did a study with Dr Kristen Mark
on the topic of sexual boredom. We surveyed nearly 3,500 people
in committed relationships and found that more than 50 percent were
either bored or on the brink of boredom. Women were twice as likely to be bored
in the first year of a relationship, and men got bored
in the first three years. That's a whole lot of boredom
on both sides of the bed. But the good news, the vast majority of respondents
were entirely interested in trying something new
that their partners suggested. So the antidote to boredom,
it could just be a sexy suggestion away. It could be as simple
as waking up one morning, looking at your partner and just saying, ""Hey, I just had
the hottest dream about you."" And then you fill in the blanks. If it makes you blush,
just blame it on your subconscious. The point is that sexy suggestion, that little nugget
of psychological arousal, that could be the difference
between lying in bed next to someone and feeling a million miles apart, or getting on that arousal runway
together and taking off. 11:12So what do you think? After a year and a half of being grounded, Isn't it time to spread our sexual wings
and let ourselves fly? 11:25Thank you."
3,Is it really that bad to marry my cousin?,Mona Chalabi,Nov 2021,"There are things we accept as obvious truths that aren't necessarily backed up by data.

as obvious truths that aren't necessarily
backed up by data. For example, the idea that cousin marriage is,
to use a scientific term, icky. 00:10[Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi] 00:13First off, cousin marriage
is way more common than you may think. Approximately 10 percent
of the world's families are headed by couples
who are second cousins or closer. That's more than 750 million people. And it maybe wildly out of fashion
in Europe and North America now, but like hoop skirts and top hats, cousin marriage used to be
a much more common sight. 00:33People like Charles Darwin,
Edgar Allan Poe and Albert Einstein, all married their first cousins. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt married his fifth cousin,
Eleanor Roosevelt. She didn't even have
to change her last name. One study looking at millions
of genealogy profiles concluded that between 1650 and 1850, the average person was fourth cousins
with their spouse. 00:55I know, I know, what the hell
is a fourth cousin? Well, it basically means
that the average person had the same great great great grandparent
as their romantic partner. So why was that? Well, marrying a cousin meant keeping
money and power within the family and maintaining your social relationships. It was also about proximity. If you weren't traveling far
in your young life, you're more likely to end up
with someone you already know, like a second cousin. 01:20But even with the onset of the railroad
and the industrial revolution, it still took another 50 years for cousin marriage to go
out of style in Western society. Mobility may have played a factor, but researchers also think
that greater autonomy for women and smaller family sizes, meaning that there were just
fewer cousins to marry, also influenced the change. 01:38Though it became much less popular
on both sides of the Atlantic, it was only in the US
that it became illegal. Following the Civil War, the American government
took a greater interest in overseeing more elements of daily life, including marriage. American states began to outlaw
not only interracial marriage but cousin marriage as well. Today, 32 states either
outright ban the practice or restrict it to those
who seek genetic counseling, are beyond reproductive age
or are sterile. 02:04It's estimated that less than one percent
of American couples are cousins. But the widespread illegality,
not to mention the social stigma, makes quantifying it quite difficult. If you ask people
why cousin marriage seems wrong, health might come up. The fear of birth defects
and genetic disorders has influenced the change in social norms. But in 2002, researchers from the National Society
of Genetic Counselors found that the increased risk was a minor one. In the general population, the risk that a child will be born
with serious complications is three to four percent. With a first-cousin couple, the risk increased by 1.7 to 2.8
percentage points. And with those figures, the researchers concluded
that there was no biological reason to discourage cousins from marrying. 02:46Look, I totally get it. Whether you fancy your cousin or not, depending on where you're from, this can still be a bit
of a taboo subject. But the truth is, our feelings around it
are shaped by the culture we live in and not necessarily by whether
it's objectively dangerous or not. After all, if it wasn't for cousin marriage,
you probably wouldn't be here."
3,This is what LGBT life is like around the world,Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols,Nov 2015,"As a gay couple in San Francisco, Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols had a relatively easy time living the way they wanted.

my parents I was gay, the first thing they said to me was, ""We're bringing you back to Taiwan."" 00:07(Laughter) 00:10In their minds, my sexual orientation
was America's fault. The West had corrupted me
with divergent ideas, and if only my parents
had never left Taiwan, this would not have happened
to their only daughter. In truth, I wondered if they were right. 00:26Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people
in every part of the world. But is the idea of living an ""out"" life, in the ""I'm gay, this is my spouse,
and we're proud of our lives together"" kind of way just a Western idea? 00:43If I had grown up in Taiwan,
or any place outside of the West, would I have found models
of happy, thriving LGBT people? 00:51Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions. As an HIV social worker in San Francisco, I had met many gay immigrants. They told me their stories
of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons
why they escaped to the US. I saw how this had beaten them down. After 10 years of doing this kind of work, I needed better stories for myself. I knew the world was far from perfect, but surely not every gay story was tragic. 01:17JC: So as a couple, we both had a need
to find stories of hope. So we set off on a mission
to travel the world and look for the people
we finally termed as the ""Supergays."" 01:27(Laughter) 01:31These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something
extraordinary in the world. They would be courageous, resilient, and most of all, proud of who they were. They would be the kind of person
that I aspire to be. Our plan was to share their stories
to the world through film. 01:50LD: There was just one problem. We had zero reporting
and zero filmmaking experience. 01:55(Laughter) 01:56We didn't even know
where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd
figure it all out along the way. So we picked 15 countries
in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West
that varied in terms of LGBT rights. We bought a camcorder, ordered a book
on how to make a documentary -- 02:12(Laughter) 02:14you can learn a lot these days -- and set off on an around-the-world trip. 02:20footnotefootnoteJC: One of the first countries
that we traveled to was Nepal. Despite widespread poverty,
a decade-long civil war, and now recently,
a devastating earthquake, Nepal has made significant strides
in the fight for equality. One of the key figures
in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha. A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome
being expelled from school and getting incarcerated
because of her gender presentation. But, in 2007, Bhumika
and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned
the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination. 03:01Here's Bhumika: 03:03(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of? I'm a transgendered person. I'm so proud of my life. On December 21, 2007, the supreme court gave the decision
for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage. 03:20LD: I can appreciate
Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis. Something as simple
as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge
when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations. Traveling throughout Asia, I tended to freak out women
in public restrooms. They weren't used to seeing
someone like me. I had to come up with a strategy,
so that I could just pee in peace. 03:42(Laughter) 03:43So anytime I would enter a restroom, I would thrust out my chest
to show my womanly parts, and try to be as
non-threatening as possible. Putting out my hands and saying, ""Hello"", just so that people
could hear my feminine voice. This all gets pretty exhausting,
but it's just who I am. I can't be anything else. 04:01JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India. On one hand, India is a Hindu society, without a tradition of homophobia. On the other hand, it is also a society
with a deeply patriarchal system, which rejects anything
that threatens the male-female order. When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins
with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status
is established in society. And in that way, the status of LGBT people
can be affirmed as well. 04:34LD: There we met Prince Manvendra. He's the world's first openly gay prince. Prince Manvendra came out
on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing
great shame to the royal family. We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided
to come out so very publicly. 04:54Here he is: 04:55(Video) Prince Manvendra: 
I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination
which is existing in our society. And that instigated me to come out openly
and talk about myself. Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,
we are transgender, bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from, we have to all unite
and fight for our rights. Gay rights cannot be won
in the court rooms, but in the hearts and the minds
of the people. 05:23JC: While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, ""Do you have a husband?"" Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot
by locals while traveling. When I explained to her
that I was with a woman instead of a man, she was incredulous, and she asked me a lot of questions
about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad
that I'd never be able to have children. I told her that there are
no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan
to have a family some day. Now, this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner. She couldn't imagine
that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country. That is, until I showed her
the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. She recognized Prince Manvendra
from television and soon I had an audience
of other hairdressers interested in meeting me. 06:15(Laughter) 06:17And in that ordinary afternoon, I had the chance to introduce
an entire beauty salon to the social changes
that were happening in their own country. 06:27footnotefootnoteLD: From India,
we traveled to East Africa, a region known for intolerance
towards LGBT people. In Kenya, 89 percent of people
who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime
and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya, we met
the soft-spoken David Kuria. David had a huge mission
of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government. So he decided to run for senate. He became Kenya's first
openly gay political candidate. David wanted to run his campaign
without denying the reality of who he was. But we were worried for his safety because he started
to receive death threats. 07:06(Video) David Kuria: 
At that point, I was really scared because they were
actually asking for me to be killed. And, yeah, there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing
a religious obligation. 07:21JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was. Even in the face of threats, he stayed authentic. 07:28footnotefootnoteLD: At the opposite end
of the spectrum is Argentina. Argentina's a country where 92 percent
of the population identifies as Catholic. Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws
that are even more progressive than here in the US. In 2010, Argentina became
the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world
to adopt marriage equality. 07:50There, we met María Rachid. María was a driving force
behind that movement. 07:55María Rachid (Spanish):
I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples
that get married. They are for a lot of people that,
even though they may never get married, will be perceived differently
by their coworkers, their families and neighbors, from the national state's
message of equality. I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today
is a model of equality. And hopefully soon, the whole world will have the same rights. 08:27JC: When we made the visit
to my ancestral lands, I wish I could have shown
my parents what we found there. Because here is who we met: 08:35(Video) One, two, three.
Welcome gays to Shanghai! 08:40(Laughter) 08:46A whole community of young,
beautiful Chinese LGBT people. Sure, they had their struggles. But they were fighting it out. In Shanghai, I had the chance
to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story
in my broken Mandarin Chinese. In Taipei, each time
we got onto the metro, we saw yet another
lesbian couple holding hands. And we learned that Asia's
largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away
from where my grandparents live. If only my parents knew. 09:21LD: By the time we finished our
not-so-straight journey around the world, 09:24(Laughter) 09:26we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage. We traveled to 15 countries and interviewed 50 Supergays. Turns out, it wasn't hard
to find them at all. 09:37JC: Yes, there are still
tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality. And let's not forget that 75 countries
still criminalize homosexuality today. But there are also stories
of hope and courage in every corner of the world. What we ultimately took away
from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention. 10:02LD: One of the key factors
in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people
embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another. When Nepal protected
against LGBT discrimination, India pushed harder. When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed. When Ireland said yes to equality, 10:33(Applause) 10:37the world stopped to notice. When the US Supreme Court
makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of. 10:43(Applause) 10:50JC: As we reviewed our footage, what we realized is that
we were watching a love story. It wasn't a love story
that was expected of me, but it is one filled
with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined. One year after returning home
from our trip, marriage equality came to California. And in the end, we believe,
love will win out. 11:18(Video) By the power vested in me, by the state of California and by God Almighty, I now pronounce you spouses for life. You may kiss. 11:30(Applause)"
3,Sex education should start with consent,Kaz,Feb 2022,"Consent can be a tricky topic to talk about in sex education curriculums, but it doesn't have to be. In this hilarious and relatable talk, sex educator and TED Fellow Kaz offers a fresh look at teaching young people about the core principles of consent -- and shows how demystifying this topic leads to healthier and more satisfying relationships for people of all ages.", (56K),"Transcript (8 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolItalianoPortuguês brasileiroTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)FootnotesFootnotes00:01Seems like only yesterday
my mother said to me, ""The ugliest thing in the world is a naked man with socks on."" 00:10(Laughter) 00:14Can you believe that was the first piece
of sex advice I ever received? 00:18(Laughter) 00:20I was 11 years old, growing up in Kenya, and I believe this might have been
my mother's way of trying to scare me out of having intimate
relationships with men. It didn't. 00:31(Laughter) 00:32Instead, I became fascinated by sex. I wanted to hear
other people's stories about sex and watch all the movies
with all the sex scenes. Everything about this very taboo subject
was so intriguing to me. 00:49Well, now my mum's gone. Nine years this year. And true to her word, the ugliest thing in the world
is a naked man with socks on. 00:58(Laughter) 01:01But over time, I have found things
to be far much uglier. It took me a ton of therapy to realize that my fixation with sex
was due to a traumatized childhood. See, I was sexually assaulted
when I was eight years old. And I never told anybody, because even in my
comedic-sex-advice household, I still didn't learn about consent. And I was afraid. Afraid that I would get into trouble. Afraid that it was my fault
or that nobody would believe me. Or, worse still, afraid that my parents
would ground me forever. 01:43And I'm not alone. Men sexually assault women and girls
on a massive rate in Kenya, where 45 percent of women
aged between 15 and 49 have reported either physical
or sexual violence. Actually, only 14 percent
have reported sexual violence. And this is possibly
because most of this violence happens in domestic partnerships, where the perpetrator
is known by the victim. And these patterns play out
all around the world. And I truly believe that it's a lack
of sex education in schools that is partially to blame. 02:26Back home, the education system is one
of destroying your relationship with self, shaming you for your discovery and then praising you
for how much you conform. This, coupled with disturbing
imagery of ailing genitals, is aimed at teaching us one thing: to abstain from all sexual activity. The perfect puritanical society. 02:57But of course, young people
are still having sex. They just don't understand
the consequences of their adult-like choices. This, too, was my experience. I had zero resources growing up and, unfortunately, often found myself
in less-than-favorable situations as a teen and a young adult. Add on to that coming out as a queer woman
in a very homophobic country. My therapist once jokingly said
that I needed to pick a struggle. 03:32(Laughter) 03:36All of this is to say, I really want to create a better
transition process for young people, because I truly believe
that the more we talk about sex, the safer and the better
it'll be for everybody. 03:52(Applause) 03:58So in 2016, I started a sex-positive podcast
called ""The Spread."" 04:05(Laughter) 04:07Targeted at a pan-African audience. I really wanted to create a safe space where young people could openly talk
about different aspects of their sexuality without feelings of shame or judgment. And it turns out
people love to talk about sex. 04:26(Laughter) 04:28And I've had the great pleasure and honor of answering a myriad of these questions
about sex on my podcast, such as, ""My boyfriend says that if we have sex and it's my first time
and without a condom, that I won't get pregnant. Is this true?"" Of course it's not true. Having sex without a condom poses
great risk of not only getting pregnant but contracting STIs. 04:51Or, “I watch too much porn, and I'm no longer aroused by my partner. Am I broken?"" No, you're not broken. But too much porn can desensitize you
from real-life pleasures. 05:04Or, ""I'm 24 years old and my friends make fun of me
because I'm a virgin. Should I have sex
just to gain popularity?"" Absolutely not. First of all, virginity
is a social construct. And I think you should have
your sexual debut -- 05:22(Applause) 05:24thank you -- when you’re good and ready to. 05:27A lot of the time, we have a lot of fun
on the podcast, honestly. But sometimes it does get
a little bit serious, especially when it comes
to one topic in particular: consent. These are some of the questions I receive. ""My husband insists on having sex with me
even when I don't want to. I've relayed my concerns. He always responds with, 'You're my wife.
It's your place to do so.' How do I prevent this from happening?"" 05:55Or, ""I went out last night
and woke up this morning next to the guy that was chatting me up. I have no idea what happened,
but I think we had sex. What should I do?"" 06:05It's conversations like these that reinforce the fact
that people don't have the first clue how to talk about consent. So it's become my life's work to create a curriculum
to educate young people on consent. 06:21Now the inspiration for this
might surprise you, but I got it in my 30s after a visit to a BDSM dungeon. 06:32(Laughter) 06:33For those of you that don't know, BDSM is a series of practices
and erotic role play that involve bondage, discipline, dominance and submission
and sadomasochism. Now I know, a lot of people
have a lot of misleading information about the BDSM community, but more often than not, we create and curate safe spaces with an array of toys and items
for the kinky community to play with, if they so please. It's like a playground. For adults. 07:08(Laughter) 07:10In BDSM, everything is negotiated
before it happens. And these are some
of the rules and regulations that would greet you upon entry. One: Do not touch anyone without asking. Even a hug, if you don't know somebody,
is a bad move without permission. Two: Do not touch anyone's toys
without permission. If you're not sure
if something is a toy, ask. Three: Consent can be withdrawn
at any time during an activity. And my personal favorite: if consent is not given, do not ask again. Accept and respect a ""no,"" as graciously as you would a ""yes."" 07:56(Applause) 08:02Now, in no way am I interested
in teaching children BDSM. 08:06(Laughter) 08:08But BDSM, a community
that is created strictly for adults that people view
as shameful and dangerous, has better guidelines
for learning about consent than many homes or schools in many parts of the world. And like you've heard,
these rules aren't specifically sexual, but they can apply to sex. I truly think that the strategy to raising adults
with healthy sexual behaviors is to first teach kids about consent, like, super early, way before sex is even a topic
of conversation. 08:46Can you imagine
having conversations with kids and letting them know that everything
about their bodies can be negotiated? For example, let them decide who they want
to help them during bath time. Or tell them that they don't have to accept
that kiss on the cheek from grandma. Or tell them that they
have to ask for a permission before they play
with somebody else's toy truck. And let them know that they can say, ""Actually my pronouns are they/them,"" without feeling guilty. 09:15(Applause) 09:19It's these tools that will help
keep our children safe and respect people throughout their lives. We have the power to shape the future. The solutions are simple. It's the patriarchy
that's so damn difficult. 09:36(Laughter) 09:38(Applause) 09:42So let's engage five,
six or eight-year-olds on conversation around consent and bodily autonomy as a function of affirming their humanity, which in turn can look like adults
having safe, healthy, pleasurable and fun sex. Because consent isn't just about sex. It's first about communication
and relationships. 10:16Thank you. 10:17(Applause)"
3,What you discover when you really listen,Hrishikesh Hirway,Oct 2021,"""Every conversation has the potential to open up and reveal all the layers and layers within it, all those rooms within rooms,"" says podcaster and musician Hrishikesh Hirway. In this profoundly moving talk, he offers a guide to deep conversations and explores what you learn when you stop to listen closely. Stay tuned to the end to hear a performance of his original song ""Between There and Here (feat. Yo-Yo Ma).""", (80K),"Transcript (13 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語00:01I've been in love
with music my whole life, both as a musician and as a listener. But as a listener, sometimes songs feel
a little like houses to me, houses that you can
only see from the street. You can stop and admire them
from the outside. You can say, ""Wow, look,
the architecture is amazing. You might be able to get a little peek
inside through one of the windows, but it’s this thing of beauty that you
have to appreciate from a distance because it's not yours. 00:31And as a musician, when you put
a song out into the world, it can sometimes feel
like you're trapped in the backyard of this house that you built. There might be people looking at it, but you never get the chance
to show them anything inside. Inside a song, there are all these parts
that get imagined and written and recorded that are so full of thought and beauty, but only the people who've made the song ever get to hear
those pieces on their own. All those pieces get smushed together
in the final version that comes out. 01:03Whenever I put out a song,
I was always a little sad that no one else was going to get to hear
the things that I had heard when I was making it. 01:11Let me show you what I mean.
Here's a clip from a song of mine. 01:14(Guitar plays a soft accompaniment) 01:18(Cello plays a flowing melody) 01:38OK. What's your experience
when you listen to that? You might like it, maybe,
or you might hate it, or you might say, ""I don't know, dude, it's 20 seconds of a song,
what do you want from me?"" Which is fair. What I hear is impossible
to expect anyone else to hear. It's not just the cello part
and the guitar part and the drum beat. It's also all the things
that I lived through in order for that music to exist. 02:04So in 2014, I started a show to try and solve this distance
between the creator and the audience. I interviewed musicians
about one of their songs and then combined that
with the different layers of music that make up that song. I thought this way
an artist could bring a listener in and give them a guided tour
of this house they made. They could point to the foundation and say, ""This is how
the song got started."" And then as more and more
layers get built on top, eventually the full song gets revealed. The show is called ""Song Exploder."" It's a pod -- 02:39(Applause) 02:43“Song Exploder” is a podcast, and it's also a TV show
that I adapted for Netflix. And over the years, I've gotten to talk to some of the biggest musicians
in the world about their work. People like Fleetwood Mac and U2,
Lin-Manuel Miranda, Alicia Keys, Billie Eilish, The Roots and Yo-Yo Ma,
and over 200 others. 03:04At first, I was really looking
at those isolated pieces of music to do the work of revealing
the inside of their respective houses. But as I was having conversations
with them about their songs, something happened. I realized that there were rooms to be discovered
in the conversations themselves, doors that could be opened. And I started to wonder: Could I try listening to people the way that I was trying
to listen to music? Because when someone tells you something,
just like with a song, there can be all these layers within it. There can be all this context
that you're missing as the person out on the street,
outside of the house. 03:48So to get inside,
I had to listen for those moments, those clues where there was
more to be discovered, where there was
something below the surface of what was first presented to me. So I borrowed from
my music-listening brain, and now when I’m in a conversation,
this is what I try to do. Be open to new ideas. Stop multitasking. Let the other person know
that you’re engaged, and do it without taking your focus away
from them and turning it onto you. 04:19Because of making ""Song Exploder,"" I now listen to a much wider
range of music than I used to. When I was younger, I used to actually pride myself
on my music snobbery. But nowadays, it just feels
like I'm potentially cutting myself off from hearing some great ideas. And I think that’s a prerequisite
when it comes to listening to people, too. You have to go into it
open-minded and curious and ready to learn something new. 04:47Also, the instinct to multitask
is so hard to turn off, but it's so important that you do it. You know, when you're listening
to music these days, most of the time it's something
that we do passively. It's in the background. It's the soundtrack
to something else that we're doing. And I hate to say it, but between
our phones and our smartwatches and just our own wandering thoughts, it's easy to get distracted, and we tend to listen
to other people that way, too. But you can't really get immersed
if that's the case. Imagine trying to listen to a song while singing a different
song in your head. You can't do it or you can't do it well. And you can't fully appreciate
what someone else is saying if you're thinking about something else. 05:31I'm also a big believer in the power
of nonverbal communication. Like, just the simple act of a nod is a way to let the other person know
that you're engaged and also invites them
to keep going and say more. That kind of intentional, engaged silence
makes space for them. 05:52Sometimes, though,
you do have to actually ask for more. You have to draw them out. But if you can ask for what's below
the surface of what they just said, you might unlock some door for them and invite them to go through it with you. That also means turning off the instinct
to talk about yourself. I used to think that this was actually
the best way to show that I was really listening. Someone would tell me something and I’d say, “That reminds me
of this thing that happened to me,” and then I would tell
a whole story of my own. But it's kind of like listening
to half a song and then saying, ""Oh, you know, this part
reminds me of this other song,"" and then turning that first song off
and going and putting on some other song, which is also something I've done. 06:37(Laughter) 06:39But you can't get deeper
if you lose the moment like that. So it's a challenge to your impatience
and to your selfishness to be engaged without making it about you. 06:53OK, and so now to ignore the advice
about talking about yourself. I would like to talk about myself and tell you a little bit about me
and that song that I played you a part of to hopefully illustrate
what I'm talking about. 07:09Years ago, when I was making
my first recordings, I would play my songs over and over
and over again in my bedroom. My music career wasn't really something
I could talk about with my parents. They were hardworking immigrants whose dream for me had been
to become a doctor or a lawyer. But every now and then, I would hear my mom
humming one of my songs just to herself in the kitchen. And that felt like some kind
of unspoken approval. And over the years, whenever I would hear
my mom humming one of my songs, it made me so happy. 07:45Last fall, my mom passed away. And a few weeks after her funeral, I had a dream where I got
to see her and talk to her and visit with her for a little bit. And I woke up filled
with longing and sadness but also gratitude
for this moment and this dream. And I ended up writing a song about it. 08:11(Guitar plays a soft accompaniment) 08:13(Sings) But it's so good to see you. 08:19It's so good to see you, see you again. 08:28In the bridge, I stopped singing for a little bit
and I just hummed a melody. 08:34(Humming) 08:39I was thinking about my mom, and I wanted to try and represent her
in the music in some way. 08:47One of the people
who I talked to about the song while I was making it was Yo-Yo Ma. I told him, this is what the song is about and this is what the music
is supposed to do in this part. And I asked him,
""Do you think that the cello could represent my mom's voice?"" And he listened to everything that I said.
And then he played those notes. 09:08(Cello plays a flowing melody) 09:15OK. Here's everything together again. 09:17(Guitar plays a soft accompaniment) 09:20(Cello plays a flowing melody) 09:41So now, what’s your experience
when you listen to that from inside the house? Every conversation has the potential
to open up and reveal all the layers and layers within it, all those rooms within rooms. And personally, I hope
that I can keep looking for those ways in so I can experience the depth
and the richness of someone else's ideas every chance I get to hear them. 10:06For now, thanks for listening to mine. Thank you. 10:10(Applause) 10:23(Plays a soft tune) 10:34(Sings) You called out my name 10:39“Bring me some water, my love” 10:45And it all felt the same 10:50As any other night of my life 11:00We lived at home back then 11:04It still feels like home in my sleep 11:11I woke to dark again 11:16For a moment 11:19It was you and me 11:25You’re a piece of a dream now 11:30Just a little too far 11:36I can still hear your voice through 11:42The door left ajar 11:46But can’t see where you are 11:52By the murmuring TV 11:57You’d fall asleep to in bed 12:04You sat and looked at me 12:08I said I miss you 12:12You said, “I know” 12:18The pictures that I’ve framed 12:23Don’t tell the stories in between 12:29The moments that contain 12:34Who you were really to me 12:40You’re a piece of a dream now 12:46Just a little too far 12:51I can still hear your voice through 12:57The door left ajar 13:02I guess that’s how it is now -- 13:08The only place you’ll appear 13:13We'll have to meet in some shadow 13:20Between there and here 13:24Between there and here 13:30But it’s so good to see you 13:36It’s so good to see you See you again 13:45(Hums a soft melody) 14:03You’re a piece of a dream now 14:09Just a little too far 14:14I can still hear your voice through 14:20The door left ajar 14:25I guess that’s how it is now -- 14:30The only place you’ll appear 14:36We'll have to meet in some shadow 14:42Between there and here 14:46Between there and here 14:55Thank you. 14:56(Applause)"

In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.", (1.3M),"Transcript (45 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDanskDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsO'zbekPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάБеларуская моваМонголРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیहिन्दीతెలుగుภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time
and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their
most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them
was to get rich. And another 50 percent
of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. 00:38(Laughter) 00:40And we're constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them, those pictures
are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people
to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory
is downright creative. 01:24But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy? 01:43We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study
of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked
the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. 02:13Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade because too many people
drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence
of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. 03:03Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores
at Harvard College. They all finished college
during World War II, and then most went off
to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water. 03:42When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers
grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom
all the way to the very top, and some made that journey
in the opposite direction. 04:23The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that
the study still continues. Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions
about their lives. 04:48Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, ""Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."" The Harvard men never ask that question. 04:59(Laughter) 05:08To get the clearest picture
of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records
from their doctors. We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives if they would join us
as members of the study, many of the women said,
""You know, it's about time."" 05:38(Laughter) 05:39So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period. 06:11We've learned three big lessons
about relationships. The first is that social connections
are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people
who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact
is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely. 07:07And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just
the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective. 07:45Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age
cholesterol levels that predicted how they
were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days
when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were
in unhappy relationships, on the days when they
reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. 08:52And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s
is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need, those people's memories
stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really
can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline. And those good relationships,
they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll
on their memories. 09:49So this message, that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way. Relationships are messy
and they're complicated and the hard work of tending
to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials
in that recent survey, many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement were what they needed to go after
to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. 11:09So what about you? Let's say you're 25,
or you're 40, or you're 60. What might leaning in
to relationships even look like? 11:19Well, the possibilities
are practically endless. It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. 11:52I'd like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: ""There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant,
so to speak, for that."" 12:22The good life is built
with good relationships. 12:27Thank you. 12:28(Applause)"
3,The difference between healthy and unhealthy love,Katie Hood,May 2019,"In a talk about understanding and practicing the art of healthy relationships, Katie Hood reveals the five signs you might be in an unhealthy relationship -- with a romantic partner, a friend, a family member -- and shares the things you can do every day to love with respect, kindness and joy. ""While love is an instinct and an emotion, the ability to love better is a skill we can all build and improve on over time,"" she says.", (304K),"Transcript (34 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So when you think about a child,
a close friend, or a romantic partner, the word ""love"" probably comes to mind, and instantly other emotions rush in: joy and hope, excitement, trust and security, and yes, sometimes
sadness and disappointment. There might not be
a word in the dictionary that more of us
are connected to than love. 00:25Yet, given its central
importance in our lives, isn't it interesting that we're never
explicitly taught how to love? We build friendships, navigate early romantic relationships, get married and bring babies
home from the hospital with the expectation
that we'll figure it out. But the truth is, we often
harm and disrespect the ones we love. It can be subtle things like guilting a friend
into spending time with you or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts or shaming a child
for their lack of effort at school. 100 percent of us
will be on the receiving end of unhealthy relationship behaviors and 100 percent of us
will do unhealthy things. It's part of being human. In its worst form,
the harm we inflict on loved ones shows up as abuse and violence, and relationship abuse is something that one in three women
and one in four men will experience in their lifetime. Now, if you're like most people,
when you hear those stats, you'll go, ""Oh, no, no, no,
that would never happen to me."" It's instinctual to move away
from the words ""abuse"" and ""violence,"" to think that they happen
to someone else somewhere else. But the truth is, unhealthy relationships
and abuse are all around us. We just call them different things
and ignore the connection. Abuse sneaks up on us
disguised in unhealthy love. 01:47I work for an organization called One Love started by a family whose daughter
Yeardley was killed by her ex-boyfriend. This was a tragedy no one saw coming, but when they looked back,
they realized the warning signs were there just no one understood
what they were seeing. Called crazy or drama
or too much drinking, his actions weren't understood
to be what they really were, which was clear signs of danger. Her family realized that if anyone
had been educated about these signs, her death could have been prevented. So today we're on a mission to make sure that others have the information
that Yeardley and her friends didn't. We have three main goals: give all of us a language
for talking about a subject that's quite awkward
and uncomfortable to discuss; empower a whole front line,
namely friends, to help; and, in the process, improve
all of our ability to love better. 02:43To do this, it's always important
to start by illuminating the unhealthy signs
that we frequently miss, and our work really focuses
on creating content to start conversations with young people. As you'd expect, most of our content
is pretty serious, given the subject at hand, but today I'm going to use
one of our more light-hearted yet still thought-provoking pieces, ""The Couplets,"" to illuminate five markers
of unhealthy love. 03:09The first is intensity. 03:12(Video) Blue: I haven't seen you
in a couple days. I've missed you. 03:15Orange: I've missed you too. (#thatslove) 03:17Blue: I haven't seen you in five minutes.
It feels like a lifetime. What have you been doing
without me for five whole minutes? 03:23Orange: It's been three minutes.
(#thatsnotlove) 03:26Katie Hood: Anybody recognize that?
I don't know. I do. Abusive relationships
don't start out abusive. They start out exciting and exhilarating. There's an intensity
of affection and emotion, a rush. It feels really good. You feel so lucky,
like you've hit the jackpot. But in unhealthy love,
these feelings shift over time from exciting to overwhelming
and maybe a little bit suffocating. You feel it in your gut. Maybe it's when your
new boyfriend or girlfriend says ""I love you""
faster than you were ready for or starts showing up everywhere,
texting and calling a lot. Maybe they're impatient
when you're slow to respond, even though they know
you had other things going on that day. It's important to remember that it's not
how a relationship starts that matters, it's how it evolves. It's important in the early days
of a new relationship to pay attention to how you're feeling. Are you comfortable
with the pace of intimacy? Do you feel like you have space
and room to breathe? It's also really important
to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs. Are your requests respected? 04:33A second marker is isolation. 04:37(Video) Orange 2: Want to hang out? 04:39Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend
always have Monday Funday. 04:42Orange 2: Want to hang out? 04:43Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend
always have Monday Funday. 04:46Orange 2: Tomorrow?
Orange 1: It's our Tuesday Snooze Day. 04:49Orange 2: Wednesday?
Orange 1: No Friends Day. 04:52KH: If you ask me, isolation
is one of the most frequently missed and misunderstood signs of unhealthy love. Why? Because every new relationship
starts out with this intense desire to spend time together, it's easy to miss when something shifts. Isolation creeps in
when your new boyfriend or girlfriend starts pulling you away
from your friends and family, your support system, and tethering you more tightly to them. They might say things like, ""Why do you hang out with them?
They're such losers"" about your best friends, or, ""They want us to break up.
They're totally against us"" about your family. Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt about everyone from
your prerelationship life. Healthy love includes independence, two people who love spending time together but who stay connected to the people
and activities they cared about before. While at first you might spend
every waking minute together, over time maintaining independence is key. You do this by making plans with friends
and sticking to them and encouraging your partner
to do the same. 05:55A third marker of unhealthy love
is extreme jealousy. 05:59(Video) Blue 2:
What are you so happy about? 06:01Blue 1: She just started
following me on Instagram! 06:04Blue 2: What are you so nervous about? 06:06Blue 1: She, she just started
following me, like, everywhere. 06:10(#thatsnotlove) 06:14KH: As the honeymoon period
begins to fade, extreme jealousy can creep in. Your partner might become more demanding, needing to know where you are
and who you're with all the time, or they might start following you
everywhere, online and off. Extreme jealousy also brings with it
possessiveness and mistrust, frequent accusations
of flirting with other people or cheating, and refusal to listen to you
when you tell them they have nothing to worry about
and that you only love them. Jealousy is a part
of any human relationship, but extreme jealousy is different. There's a threatening, desperate
and angry edge to it. Love shouldn't feel like this. 06:52A fourth marker is belittling. 06:54(Video) Blue: Wanna hang out?
Orange: I gotta study. 06:57Blue: You'll get an A anyway,
A for amazing. (#thatslove) 07:00Blue: Wanna hang out?
Orange: I gotta study. 07:03Blue: You'll get an F anyway, F for, F for... stupid. (#thatsnotlove) 07:08KH: Yeah, hmm. In unhealthy love,
words are used as weapons. Conversations that used to be
fun and lighthearted turn mean and embarrassing. Maybe your partner makes fun of you
in a way that hurts, or maybe they tell stories and jokes
for laughs at your expense. When you try to explain
that your feelings have been hurt, they shut you down
and accuse you of overreacting. ""Why are you so sensitive?
What's your problem. Give me a break."" You are silenced by these words. It seems pretty obvious,
but your partner should have your back. Their words should build you up,
not break you down. They should keep
your secrets and be loyal. They should make you feel more confident, not less. 07:50Finally, a fifth marker: volatility. 07:54(Video) Orange 1:
I'd be sad if we broke up. 07:56Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove) 07:59Orange 1: I'd so depressed
if we ever broke up. I'd throw myself off this step. I would! Don't try to stop me! 08:05(#thatsnotlove) 08:09KH: Frequent breakups and makeups,
high highs and low lows: as tension rises, so does volatility. Tearful, frustrated fights
followed by emotional makeups, hateful and hurtful comments like, ""You're worthless,
I'm not even sure why I'm with you!"" followed quickly by apologies
and promises it will never happen again. By this point, you've been so conditioned
to this relationship roller coaster that you may not realize how unhealthy
and maybe even dangerous your relationship has become. 08:39It can be really hard to see when unhealthy love turns towards abuse, but it's fair to say
that the more of these markers your relationship might have, the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous
your relationship could be. And if your instinct is
to break up and leave, which is advice
so many of us give our friends when they're in unhealthy relationships, that's not always the best advice. Time of breakup can be
a real trigger for violence. If you fear you might be
headed towards abuse or in abuse, you need to consult with experts
to get the advice on how to leave safely. 09:11But it's not just
about romantic relationships and it's not just about violence. Understanding the signs of unhealthy love can help you audit and understand
nearly every relationship in your life. For the first time, you might understand
why you're disappointed in a friendship or why every interaction
with a certain family member leaves you discouraged and anxious. You might even begin to see
how your own intensity and jealousy is causing problems
with colleagues at work. Understanding is
the first step to improving, and while you can't make
every unhealthy relationship healthy -- some you're going
to have to leave behind -- you can do your part every day
to do relationships better. And here's the exciting news: it's actually not rocket science. Open communication, mutual respect, kindness, patience -- we can practice these things every day. 10:04And while practice
will definitely make you better, I have to promise you
it's also not going to make you perfect. I do this for a living and every day I think and talk
about healthy relationships, and still I do unhealthy things. Just the other day as I was trying
to shuttle my four kids out the door amidst quarreling, squabbling
and complaints about breakfast, I completely lost it. With an intentionally angry edge, I screamed, ""Everybody just shut up and do what I say! You are the worst! I am going to take away
screen time and dessert and anything else you could possibly
ever enjoy in life!"" 10:39(Laughter) 10:41Anybody been there? 10:42(Applause) 10:45Volatility, belittling. My oldest son turned around
and looked at me, and said, ""Mom, that's not love."" 10:54(Laughter) 10:57For a minute, I really wanted
to kill him for calling me out. Trust me. But then I gathered myself and I thought, you know what,
I'm actually proud. I'm proud that he has a language
to make me pause. I want all of my kids to understand
what the bar should be for how they're treated and to have a language and a voice
to use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it. For too long, we've treated
relationships as a soft topic, when relationship skills
are one of the most important and hard to build things in life. Not only can understanding unhealthy signs help you avoid the rabbit hole
that leads to unhealthy love, but understanding and practicing
the art of being healthy can improve nearly
every aspect of your life. I'm completely convinced that while love is
an instinct and an emotion, the ability to love better
is a skill we can all build and improve on over time. 11:54Thank you. 11:55(Applause)"

Yet a rift had grown between these two forces. Setting out to prove the importance of her work, Parvati withdrew from the world and sent the Earth into darkness.

slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer 
of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. 00:19Historically, the union between 
Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium 
between thought and action on which the well-being 
of the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, 
growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, 
and the world would remain static. But together, the two formed 
a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection 
to all living things. 00:54For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped
far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart 
to Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants
were bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 01:15Yet a rift had grown 
between these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life 
with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle 
his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling 
about their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, 
the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane 
purely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things 
were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. 01:47For millennia Parvati 
had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed 
the things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove 
the importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy
that kept the Earth turning. 02:07At her disappearance, a sudden, 
terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, 
the land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank 
and crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console 
their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer
gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank 
from the darkening world. 02:37To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness
left by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune
to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt 
bottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired 
over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that 
the material world could not be so easily dismissed. 03:03At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati 
could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them 
and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge 
and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, 
the Goddess of food. 03:29With the arrival of Annapurna, 
the world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, 
and communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared
in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, 
on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen 
to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. 03:52But it was not only mere mortals 
who were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure
blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess
with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity 
is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,
while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. 04:22With these symbols, 
this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world 
is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life 
that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths 
and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth."
3,What almost dying taught me about living,Suleika Jaouad,Jun 2019,"""The hardest part of my cancer experience began once the cancer was gone,"" says author Suleika Jaouad. In this fierce, funny, wisdom-packed talk, she challenges us to think beyond the divide between ""sick"" and ""well,"" asking: How do you begin again and find meaning after life is interrupted?", (143K),"Transcript (21 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00It was the spring of 2011, and as they like to say
in commencement speeches, I was getting ready
to enter the real world. I had recently graduated from college and moved to Paris to start my first job. My dream was to become
a war correspondent, but the real world that I found took me into a really different
kind of conflict zone. 00:28At 22 years old, I was diagnosed with leukemia. The doctors told me
and my parents, point-blank, that I had about a 35 percent chance
of long-term survival. I couldn't wrap my head around
what that prognosis meant. But I understood that the reality
and the life I'd imagined for myself had shattered. Overnight, I lost my job,
my apartment, my independence, and I became patient number 5624. 01:06Over the next four years
of chemo, a clinical trial and a bone marrow transplant, the hospital became my home, my bed, the place I lived 24/7. Since it was unlikely
that I'd ever get better, I had to accept my new reality. And I adapted. I became fluent in medicalese, made friends with a group
of other young cancer patients, built a vast collection of neon wigs and learned to use
my rolling IV pole as a skateboard. I even achieved my dream
of becoming a war correspondent, although not in the way I'd expected. It started with a blog, reporting from the front lines
of my hospital bed, and it morphed into a column
I wrote for the New York Times, called ""Life, Interrupted."" 02:04But --
(Applause) 02:05Thank you. 02:07(Applause) 02:09But above all else, my focus was on surviving. And -- spoiler alert -- 02:18(Laughter) 02:20I did survive, yeah. 02:22(Applause) 02:27Thanks to an army of supportive humans, I'm not just still here,
I am cured of my cancer. 02:34(Applause) 02:36Thank you. 02:37(Applause) 02:39So, when you go through
a traumatic experience like this, people treat you differently. They start telling you
how much of an inspiration you are. They say you're a warrior. They call you a hero, someone who's lived
the mythical hero's journey, who's endured impossible trials and, against the odds,
lived to tell the tale, returning better and braver
for what you're been through. And this definitely lines up
with my experience. 03:12Cancer totally transformed my life. I left the hospital knowing
exactly who I was and what I wanted to do in the world. And now, every day as the sun rises, I drink a big glass of celery juice, and I follow this up
with 90 minutes of yoga. Then, I write down 50 things
I'm grateful for onto a scroll of paper that I fold into an origami crane
and send sailing out my window. 03:39(Laughter) 03:41Are you seriously believing any of this? 03:44(Laughter) 03:46I don't do any of these things. 03:48(Laughter) 03:49I hate yoga, and I have no idea
how to fold an origami crane. The truth is that for me, the hardest part of my cancer experience
began once the cancer was gone. That heroic journey
of the survivor we see in movies and watch play out on Instagram -- it's a myth. It isn't just untrue, it's dangerous, because it erases the very real
challenges of recovery. 04:17Now, don't get me wrong --
I am incredibly grateful to be alive, and I am painfully aware
that this struggle is a privilege that many don't get to experience. But it's important that I tell you what this projection of heroism
and expectation of constant gratitude does to people who are trying to recover. Because being cured is not
where the work of healing ends. It's where it begins. 04:47I'll never forget the day
I was discharged from the hospital, finally done with treatment. Those four years of chemo
had taken a toll on my relationship with my longtime boyfriend, and he'd recently moved out. And when I walked
into my apartment, it was quiet. Eerily so. The person I wanted to call
in this moment, the person who I knew
would understand everything, was my friend Melissa. She was a fellow cancer patient, but she had died three weeks earlier. As I stood there in the doorway
of my apartment, I wanted to cry. But I was too tired to cry. The adrenaline was gone. I had felt as if the inner scaffolding that had held me together
since my diagnosis had suddenly crumbled. I had spent the past 1,500 days
working tirelessly to achieve one goal: to survive. And now that I'd done so, I realized I had absolutely
no idea how to live. 06:01On paper, of course, I was better: I didn't have leukemia, my blood counts were back to normal, and the disability checks
soon stopped coming. To the outside world, I clearly didn't belong in the kingdom
of the sick anymore. But in reality, I never felt
further from being well. All that chemo had taken
a permanent physical toll on my body. I wondered, ""What kind of job can I hold when I need to nap for four hours
in the middle of the day? When my misfiring immune system still sends me to the ER
on a regular basis?"" And then there were the invisible,
psychological imprints my illness had left behind: the fears of relapse, the unprocessed grief, the demons of PTSD that descended upon me
for days, sometimes weeks. 06:58See, we talk about reentry in the context of war and incarceration. But we don't talk about it as much in the context of other kinds
of traumatic experiences, like an illness. Because no one had warned me
of the challenges of reentry, I thought something must be wrong with me. I felt ashamed, and with great guilt,
I kept reminding myself of how lucky I was to be alive at all, when so many people
like my friend Melissa were not. But on most days, I woke up
feeling so sad and lost, I could barely breathe. Sometimes, I even fantasized
about getting sick again. And let me tell you, there are so many better things
to fantasize about when you're in your twenties
and recently single. 07:49(Laughter) 07:51But I missed the hospital's ecosystem. Like me, everyone in there was broken. But out here, among the living,
I felt like an impostor, overwhelmed and unable to function. I also missed the sense of clarity
I'd felt at my sickest. Staring your mortality straight in the eye
has a way of simplifying things, of rerouting your focus
to what really matters. And when I was sick,
I vowed that if I survived, it had to be for something. It had to be to live a good life,
an adventurous life, a meaningful one. But the question, once I was cured, became: How? I was 27 years old
with no job, no partner, no structure. And this time, I didn't have treatment
protocols or discharge instructions to help guide my way forward. 08:46But what I did have was an in-box
full of internet messages from strangers. Over the years, people from all over the world
had read my column, and they'd responded with letters,
comments and emails. It was a mix, as is often
the case, for writers. I got a lot of unsolicited advice about how to cure my cancer
with things like essential oils. I got some questions about my bra size. But mostly -- 09:22(Laughter) 09:23mostly, I heard from people who,
in their own different way, understood what it was
that I was going through. 09:31I heard from a teenage girl in Florida who, like me, was coming out of chemo and wrote me a message
composed largely of emojis. I heard from a retired art history
professor in Ohio named Howard, who'd spent most of his life struggling with a mysterious,
debilitating health condition that he'd had from the time
he was a young man. I heard from an inmate
on death row in Texas by the name of Little GQ -- short for ""Gangster Quinn."" He'd never been sick a day in his life. He does 1,000 push-ups
to start off each morning. But he related to what
I described in one column as my ""incanceration,"" and to the experience of being confined
to a tiny fluorescent room. ""I know that our situations
are different,"" he wrote to me, ""But the threat of death
lurks in both of our shadows."" In those lonely first weeks
and months of my recovery, these strangers and their words
became lifelines, dispatches from people
of so many different backgrounds, with so many different experiences, all showing me the same thing: you can be held hostage by the worst thing
that's ever happened to you and allow it to hijack
your remaining days, or you can find a way forward. 11:02I knew I needed to make
some kind of change. I wanted to be in motion again to figure out how to unstuck myself
and to get back out into the world. And so I decided to go on
a real journey -- not the bullshit cancer one or the mythical hero's journey
that everyone thought I should be on, but a real, pack-your-bags
kind of journey. I put everything I owned into storage, rented out my apartment, borrowed a car and talked a very a dear
but somewhat smelly friend into joining me. 11:44(Laughter) 11:47Together, my dog Oscar and I
embarked on a 15,000-mile road trip around the United States. Along the way, we visited some
of those strangers who'd written to me. I needed their advice, also to say to them, thank you. I went to Ohio and stayed with Howard,
the retired professor. When you've suffered a loss or a trauma, the impulse can be to guard your heart. But Howard urged me
to open myself up to uncertainty, to the possibilities
of new love, new loss. Howard will never be cured of illness. And as a young man, he had no way
of predicting how long he'd live. But that didn't stop him
from getting married. Howard has grandkids now, and takes weekly ballroom dancing
lessons with his wife. When I visited them, they’d recently celebrated
their 50th anniversary. In his letter to me, he'd written, ""Meaning is not found
in the material realm; it's not in dinner, jazz,
cocktails or conversation. Meaning is what's left
when everything else is stripped away."" 13:02I went to Texas, and I visited
Little GQ on death row. He asked me what I did
to pass all that time I'd spent in a hospital room. When I told him that I got
really, really good at Scrabble, he said, ""Me, too!"" and explained how, even though he spends most of his days
in solitary confinement, he and his neighboring prisoners
make board games out of paper and call out their plays
through their meal slots -- a testament to the incredible tenacity
of the human spirit and our ability to adapt with creativity. 13:44And my last stop was in Florida, to see that teenage girl
who'd sent me all those emojis. Her name is Unique, which is perfect, because she's the most luminous,
curious person I've ever met. I asked her what she wants
to do next and she said, ""I want to go to college and travel and eat weird foods like octopus
that I've never tasted before and come visit you in New York and go camping, but I'm scared of bugs, but I still want to go camping."" I was in awe of her, that she could be so optimistic
and so full of plans for the future, given everything she'd been through. But as Unique showed me, it is far more radical
and dangerous to have hope than to live hemmed in by fear. 14:34But the most important thing
I learned on that road trip is that the divide between
the sick and the well -- it doesn't exist. The border is porous. As we live longer and longer, surviving illnesses and injuries
that would have killed our grandparents, even our parents, the vast majority of us will travel
back and forth between these realms, spending much of our lives
somewhere between the two. These are the terms of our existence. 15:08Now, I wish I could say
that since coming home from my road trip, I feel fully healed. I don't. But once I stopped expecting myself to return to the person
I'd been pre-diagnosis, once I learned to accept my body
and its limitations, I actually did start to feel better. And in the end, I think that's the trick: to stop seeing our health as binary, between sick and healthy, well and unwell, whole and broken; to stop thinking that there's some
beautiful, perfect state of wellness to strive for; and to quit living in a state
of constant dissatisfaction until we reach it. 15:56Every single one of us
will have our life interrupted, whether it's by the rip cord
of a diagnosis or some other kind of heartbreak
or trauma that brings us to the floor. We need to find ways to live
in the in-between place, managing whatever body
and mind we currently have. Sometimes, all it takes is the ingenuity
of a handmade game of Scrabble or finding that stripped-down
kind of meaning in the love of family and a night on the ballroom dance floor, or that radical, dangerous hope that I'm guessing will someday
lead a teenage girl terrified of bugs to go camping. 16:43If you're able to do that, then you've taken the real hero's journey. You've achieved what it means
to actually be well, which is to say: alive, in the messiest,
richest, most whole sense. 17:01Thank you, that's all I've got. 17:02(Applause) 17:05Thank you. (Applause)"
3,4 kinds of regret — and what they teach you about yourself,Daniel H. Pink,Feb 2022,"Regret is one of our most powerful emotions -- and also one of the most misunderstood. Over the past two years, author Daniel H. Pink has collected a trove of more than 16,000 regrets from people in 105 countries in an effort to better understand this mysterious emotion. He shares the key patterns that emerged (it all boils down to the same four core regrets, he says) and explains how to transform your own regrets in order to create the life you've always wanted to live. (This tal...", (65K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês de Portugalالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Let's talk about regret. It is, to my mind,
our most misunderstood emotion, and so I decided to spend
a couple of years studying it. 00:10And one of the things
that I did is I went back and I looked at about 50 years
of social science on regret. And here's what it tells you. I'll save you the trouble of reading
a half century of social science. The research tells us
that everybody has regrets, regrets make us human. Truly, the only people
without regrets are five-year-olds, people with brain damage and sociopaths. The rest of us, we have regrets, and if we treat our regrets right,
and that's a big if, but there are ways to do it, regrets can actually make us better. They can improve
our decision-making skills, improve our negotiation skills, make us better strategists,
make us better problem solvers, enhance our sense of meaning if we treat them right. And the good news is that there's
a systematic way to do that. 00:52But I want to take just a few minutes
to tell you about another aspect of regret that I think is really, really
just super interesting. As part of the research here, I decided to ask people for their regrets, and to my surprise, I ended up collecting about 16,000 regrets from people in 105 countries. It’s an extraordinary trove. And what I realized when I went through
this incredible database of human longing and aspiration is that around the world, and there's very little
national difference here, people kept expressing
the same four regrets. Around the world,
there are the same four regrets that keep coming up
over and over and over again. So what I want to do is just
quickly tell you about these four core regrets, because I think they reveal something
incredibly important and interesting. 01:43So the four core regrets
that I'm going to cover. Number one, what I call
foundation regrets. Foundation regrets. These are people
who regret things like this: not saving enough money, which would be like, you know,
financial regret, not taking care of their health
and not eating right, health regret. But they're the same. Those kinds of regrets
are about making choices that didn't allow you
to have some stability, a stable platform for their life. I have a lot of people who regret
not working hard enough in school. A lot of people who regret -- I got a lot of regrets
about not saving money. And it reminds me a little bit
of Aesop’s fable of the ant and the grasshopper, where earlier in their life they acted
like a grasshopper instead of the ant, and now it's catching up with them. So foundation regrets sound like this: ""If only"" -- And that's the catch phrase
of regret, ""if only"" -- ""If only I'd done the work."" 02:34Second category. I love this category, it's fascinating. Boldness regrets. I have hundreds of regrets
around the world that go like this: “X years ago, there was a man/woman
whom I really liked. I wanted to ask him/her out on a date, but I was too scared to do it and I've regretted it ever since."" I also have hundreds of regrets
by people who said: ""Oh, I always wanted to start a business, but I never had the guts to do that."" People who said: “Oh, I wish
I’d spoken up more. I wish I'd said something
and asserted myself."" These are, as I said before,
what I call boldness regrets. And we get to a juncture in our life
and we have a choice. We can play it safe
or we can take the chance. And what I found is overwhelmingly people regret not taking the chance. Even people who took the chance
and it didn't work out don't really have many regrets about that. It's the people
who didn't take the chance. So this is boldness regrets. Boldness regrets sound like this: ""If only I'd taken the chance."" 03:37Third category. Moral regrets. Very interesting,
very interesting category. These are people who, again, a lot of these regrets
begin at a juncture. You're at a juncture, you can do the right thing
or you can do the wrong thing. People do the wrong thing, and they regret it. I mean, one of the ones
that really stuck with me, I'm going to try to pull it up here, is this one here, this woman. She's a 71-year-old woman in New Jersey. ""When I was a kid, my mother would send me
to a small local store for a few items. I frequently would steal a candy bar
when the grocer wasn't looking. That's bothered me for about 60 years."" So 71-year-old woman in New Jersey, for 60 years, she's been bugged
by this moral breach. So moral regrets. We have people regretting bullying, we have people regretting
marital infidelity. All kinds of things. Moral regrets sound like this, “If only I’d done the right thing.” 04:34And finally, our fourth category,
or what I call connection regrets. Connection regrets are like this: You have a relationship
or ought to have a relationship. And it doesn't matter
what the relationship is. Kids, parents, siblings,
cousins, friends, colleagues, but you have a relationship
or ought to have had a relationship, and the relationship comes apart. And what's interesting is that what these
16,000 people were telling me is that the way
these relationships come apart is often not very dramatic, not very dramatic at all. They often come apart by drifting apart rather than through
some kind of explosive rift. And what happens is that people
don't want to reach out because they say it’s going to be
awkward to reach out, and the other side is not going to care. One of the lessons that I learned
from this book for myself is always reach out. So that's what connection regrets are. ""If only I'd reached out."" 05:27And so over and over and over again,
we see these same regrets: Foundation regrets:
“If only I’d done the work.” Boldness regrets:
“If only I’d taken the chance.” Moral regrets: “If only
I’d done the right thing.” And connection regrets:
“If only I’d reached out.” 05:43And when we look at these regrets,
so that's interesting in itself, but what I realized is that these 
four core regrets operate as a kind of 
photographic negative of the good life. Because if we understand
what people regret the most, we actually can understand
what they value the most. And each of these regrets, to my mind, reveals something fundamental
about humanity and about what we need. We need stability. Nobody wants to have an unstable life. We want a chance to learn
and grow and do something. We recognize that we are not here forever, and we want to do something
and try something. And at least feel
the exhilaration of being bold. Moral regrets, I think most of us, almost all of us
want to do the right thing. At some level, these moral regrets
are very heartening. The idea that people are bugged
for years, decades, by these moral breaches
earlier in their life. I think most of us
want to do the right thing. And then connection regrets. We want love, not love only
in the romantic sense, but love in the broader sense
of connection and relationship and affinity with other people. And so in a weird way, this negative emotion of regret
points the way to a good life. 06:58By studying regret, we know
what constitutes a good life, a life of stability, a life where you have a chance
to take a few risks, a life where you’re doing the right thing and a life where you have people
who love you and whom you love. And so to me, I started out saying, “Oh, boy, is this book
going to be a downer, studying regret?” And it ended up being very uplifting. And so, those are the four core regrets. Regret points us to the good life. And so I hope that you'll begin
to reckon with your own regrets because I think they're going to give you
direction to a life well lived. 07:32Whitney Pennigton Rogers:
Well, thank you for that, Dan I was clapping behind the scenes
when you couldn't actually see me, for everyone who I know also really
appreciated what you shared there. First, Dan, you mentioned,
you know, this big takeaway about how thinking about regret can help us figure out
what is the recipe for the good life. I guess what has been your biggest
takeaway from doing this work beyond that? 07:58DHP: I found it really interesting
how much people want to talk about this, and that's what got me on it
in the first place. That is, I had an experience in my life where one of my kids
graduated from college, and that sort of marker in my life
made me start thinking about what regrets that I had. And I just mentioned it to a few people, and I found them, like,
leaning in to the conversation. So I was amazed at how much
people want to talk about this and how much this taboo of like, “Oh, I don’t have any regrets,”
is so ridiculous. I mean, it's absurd. And that if we actually
start talking about it, we're going to be better off. 08:31For me personally, I think
that the biggest takeaway was the ... Was the connection regrets. Because I had so many people
who had the same story where they had a friendship, some kind of relationship, and it comes apart, and they want to reach out and they say, ""Oh no, it's going to be really awkward. And the other side's not going to care."" And we're so wrong about that. It's not awkward, and the other side
almost always appreciates it. And so for me, I guess the takeaway is
if I'm at a juncture in my life where I'm thinking, “Should I reach out
or should I not reach out?” I've answered the question. That the answer to that question
at that juncture, if you reach that juncture, the answer is, always reach out. You know, especially coming out
a time like this, Whitney, we need that sense of of connection. And so the ethic of always reaching out,
to me, is one of the best life lessons that I've learned. 09:33WPR: Well, we're going to do something
a little interesting next, Dan, which is have some Members
share their own regrets. And so I want to, I guess, hand things over to you right now
so that you can bring in our first Member and we can explore more what this process of thinking
about making our regrets help us live the good life
actually looks like. 09:51DHP: Sure, sure. And so let's bring on Lily. I don't want it to sound like a magic act,
but Lily and I don't know each other. We haven't gone through this before, but what I want to try to do is actually, the hearing of the stories
of people's regrets I think is super
interesting and revealing. We’re going to hear Lily’s regret, and we're going to talk through
what science says might be some appropriate
responses to that. So, Lily, welcome. 10:19Lily: Thank you, hi everyone. 10:21DHP: And tell us where you are. 10:24L: I'm currently in Brooklyn, New York. 10:26DHP: Brooklyn is in the house
here at TED Membership. So Lily, tell us you regret. 10:31L: Yeah. So my regret that I want to share is that for most of my young adult life from kindergarten, really,
straight through high school is that I was painfully, painfully shy with really low self-confidence. As I was thinking about this,
I was remembering, and there were times where I just
wanted to close my eyes and be invisible. And I think that, you know, my ... Like, I didn't really come into my own
until I got to college, where I found a really great
group of friends, really, like, I was confident
in expressing myself and, you know, just being myself. And I think that, you know, my regret is that I just really wish
I had taken a little bit more effort to build my confidence
to fight this a little bit more, because I worry about what opportunities
I might have missed. 11:27So ever since then, I feel like
I try to counteract it now. And if ever I meet someone
who might be going through, especially if they're younger, like going
through the same thing I did, I try to make them feel seen and try to empathize
with how they're feeling. So that's kind of a takeaway,
I guess, from that regret. 11:50DHP: But I mean, it sounds like ... So is this a regret that's still with you? 11:55L: I think ... 11:56DHP: It sounds to me like you might have
sort of begun the process of resolving it a little bit. 12:00L: Absolutely. But I think that, you know,
even just, you know, prepping for this, I start to think about like, you know, there could have been more things
that I could have done if I had just put myself
a little bit out there, if I didn't, just try to hide so much. 12:16DHP: OK, alright. This is fascinating, Lily, and I have to say,
I have this database of regrets. And you can search the database. And if I were to search the database for the phrase ""speak up,""
""spoke up,"" ""spoken up,"" I would get huge,
huge numbers of of people. It is one of the most common regrets, is that people regret not speaking up. The important thing about our regrets
that comes from the science is this: it's how we deal with them. So we can take that regret and say, ""You know what? It doesn’t matter that I feel terrible
and I have this regret, because I'm just
going to ignore it,"" right? That's like the blithe
""no regrets"" philosophy. That's a bad idea, alright? The other way at it is to say, ""Oh my God, I have all these regrets, it's so terrible,
I'm going to wallow in them."" That's a bad idea too. What we want to do, and I think that you've already done
a really brilliant job of it is use these regrets as signals. Signals for our thinking;
what is it teaching me? And so there are a few things
in the research that give us some clues about what to do. So one of them is this. So we start with sort of,
reframing the regret and how we think about it in ourselves. So do you think that you are the only
person with this kind of regret? 13:33L: I don't know. 13:34DHP: Not at all. I’m watching the chat, man. Somebody said, “Lily,
you’re telling my story.” So one of the things
that we can do with our regret is treat ourselves
with self-compassion, alright? Not boost our self-esteem, that's sometimes dangerous. Not rip ourselves down
with self-criticism, but actually say, treat ourselves with kindness
rather than contempt and recognize that what
we're going through is part of the shared human experience. That's one thing. The second thing that we can do
is we can disclose our regret. And there are few things
that are interesting about disclosure. There's something amazing
why 16,000 people were willing to share
their regrets with me. I mean, like, what's
going on there, right? And the reason is that when
we disclose our regrets, we relieve some of the burden. That's one thing. The second thing that we do is that when we actually talk
about our regrets, converting these kind of blobby mental
abstractions into concrete words, whether it's spoken or writing, defangs them. It begins the sense-making process. And the other thing about disclosure, which is a dirty little secret
that I'll reveal to all of you that comes out
in the research very clearly, is that when we disclose
our vulnerabilities and our weaknesses, people don't like us less, they actually like us more. Because they empathize with us. They respect our courage. And the final thing is to actually
try to extract a lesson from it, to use this regret. So what would you say, Lily, is the lesson that you've learned
from this regret? 15:08L: I think that ... What would have gone wrong if I ... 15:13DHP: That's interesting. 15:15L: If I were more open
about expressing myself, like, people might discover
I'm a little weird, or they might think that maybe I'm nice and hopefully maybe a little funny. So I think, like, maybe
that's one thing that jumps to mind. Like, what could have gone wrong? You know. 15:35DHP: So what's the lesson
that you have applied going forward? Taking this regret, OK, so you've sort of treated yourself
with kindness rather than contempt. You've disclosed it
to all these people here. You've begun the sense-making process
by talking about it and writing about it. What's a lesson that you can
extract from this? 15:55L: I think that ... I'm not sure. 16:02DHP: Well, then let me tell you. (Laughs) I think that the lesson is to ... Next time, speak up. Next time, speak up. Next time when you are at a juncture, ""Should I speak up or not,"" think about this. Think about this and speak up. Do you have any kind of work meetings
or anything coming on where you're going to be
confronted with this? 16:31L: Yeah, and I think
that happens all the time. Like, you know, I have an idea. Oh, but someone starts talking, and then like, you just sort of
fade back into the background, and that’s something
I want to counteract more often. Because, more often than not, you know that idea is a contribution, and why am I hesitating so much? 16:51DHP: Yeah. So you have a lesson. The lesson is, speak up. So why don't you -- So how about the next meeting you're in, when you have something to say,
don't hesitate and speak up. 17:07L: Done, I'll do it. 17:08DHP: OK, but here's the thing, what I like about this is you've just
made a promise to 300 people. So you're on the hook. 17:14L: I'm on the hook. 17:16DHP: So this is it. So, Lily has this regret. She's looking backwards, saying,
""Oh, if only I'd spoken up,"" and instead of beating herself up,
she is divulging it, she's extracting a lesson from it, and she's taking that and applying
it to some next interaction. So this is what we do. This is how, again, looking backward
can move you forward. Lily, that's such a fantastic -- People in the chat are saying,
""We will hold Lily accountable,"" which I love. So Lily, thanks for that. We're going to bring -- I really, really appreciate
your sharing that with us, and I want you to report back
that you did speak up. 17:51L: I will, thank you. 17:52DHP: Thanks, Lily. 17:54WPR: Well, we have a question here
from Claudia, who asks, ""Can you speak to the issue
of painful life regrets? Major opportunities lost? Do you have some advice on how to avoid being paralyzed
by fear or further regret?"" 18:07DHP: Yeah. It’s interesting that Claudia
said “opportunities lost,” and let me pick up
on that phrase right here. Because one of the things
I saw in my own research, because I also did a huge survey
of the American population where we surveyed a representative sample of 4,489 Americans about regret and how it worked. But one of the things you see widespread is that there are,
in the architecture of regret, there are often two kinds of regrets. One are regrets of action
and one are regrets of inaction. Regrets about what we did. Regrets about what we didn't do. And overwhelmingly,
inaction regrets predominate. And that's what an opportunity lost is. With action regrets, we can try to undo them. We can make amends. We can look for the silver lining,
and we can reduce the sting. For inaction regrets, it is harder. And so the key here
on the opportunities lost is to think about, you know, really like,
what are you going to do? You sort of reduce
the level of abstraction and say, ""What are you going to do next time?"" Not an abstraction of like,
""Oh, I'm going to be more bold."" It's like, what are you
going to do next time? This is what we were talking
about with Lily. What are you going to do next time? All regrets begin at the juncture. You can go this way
or you can go that way. And so for Claudia, I would say,
the next time you're at this juncture, take the opportunity, play it safe. Stop, think about your regret, and make the decision there. Or another thing that you could do. I'll give you another, sort of,
decision-making heuristic. Two of them, in fact. When you're at that juncture,
Claudia, next time, go forward five years. This is called self-distancing. Be Claudia five years from now,
look back on Claudia today. What decision do you want? What decision does Claudia of 2027
want Claudia of 2022 to make? It's very clear. Or the best decision-making
heuristic there is: You're at a juncture, what would you tell
your best friend to do? When you ask people that
when they're trying to make a decision, say, “What would you tell
your best friend to do?” Everybody always knows. So, I think that's it. Remember, the main thing, though,
is don't let it bog you down. Use it as a tool for thinking --
not as a tool for wallowing, not as a tool for ignoring --
but as a tool for thinking. 20:32WPR: A question from Kim, she's asking -- She says you're talking as if any
bad decision or mistake is also a regret, and I'm not sure
that that's always the case. Can you share your definition of regret? Especially after doing this project. What is your definition? 20:46DHP: There's a difference between
a regret and a mistake, alright? So you can make a mistake
and not regret it because you say, you immediately
learn something from it or it was a worthy mistake. A regret is something where
you look backward at something that where you had control,
where you had some agency ... Where you had some agency,
you did something that, well, you did something wrong,
and it sticks with you. It doesn't go away. And it sticks with you
for a very long time. So there's a big difference,
for instance, between ... I can make a mistake
and actually not regret it because it's not significant enough
to me to linger, right? So that's the difference
between a regret and a mistake. It's basically the duration, essentially, the half-life
of the negative emotion. There's a huge difference
between regret and disappointment. Huge difference between regret
and disappointment. Because with disappointment,
you don't have any kind of control. The great example of that
is from Janet Landman, a former professor at the University
of Michigan who, to me, is like, she tells the story of like, OK,
so a kid loses her third tooth. A seven-year-old loses her third tooth. She loses her tooth, she goes to sleep, before she goes to sleep,
she puts the tooth under the pillow. When she wakes up, the tooth is still there. The kid is disappointed, but the parents regret not leaving that -- So you have to have some agency
and it has to have a ... It has to have enough significance
that it stays with you. 22:21And once again, going back
to these four core regrets, it ends up being the same kinds of ... it ends up being the same kinds of things. If you said, ""Oh, I shouldn't
have bought that kind of car,"" it might sting for a little bit,
but the half-life is very, very short. But other kinds of things
stick with us and stick with us, and those are the things
often of significance. 22:43WPR: Thank you so much, Dan,
for chatting with us, and I love ending there,
""If not now when?"" And we'll see you soon. Thank you, Dan. 22:51DHP: Thanks a lot, what a pleasure. 22:53[Get access to thought-provoking events

3,Why people and AI make good business partners,Shervin Khodabandeh,Apr 2022,"What happens when the data-driven capabilities of AI are combined with human creativity and ingenuity? Shining a light on the opportunities this futuristic collaboration could bring to the workplace, AI expert Shervin Khodabandeh shares how to redesign companies so that people and machines can learn from each other.", (50K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00I've been working in AI
for most of my career, helping companies build
artificial intelligence capabilities to improve their business, which is why I think
what I'm about to tell you is quite shocking. Every year, thousands
of companies across the world spend collectively tens of billions
of dollars to build AI capabilities. But according to research
my colleagues and I have done, only about 10 percent of these companies
get any meaningful financial impact from their investments. These 10 percent winners
with AI have a secret. And their secret is not about fancy
algorithms or sophisticated technology. It's something far more basic. It's how they get their people
and AI to work together. Together, not against each other, not instead of each other. Together in a mutually
beneficial relationship. 00:55Unfortunately, when most people
think about AI, they think about the most extreme cases. That AI is here only to replace us or overtake our intelligence
and make us unnecessary. But what I'm saying is that we don't seem to quite appreciate
the huge opportunity that exists in the middle ground, where humans and AI come together to achieve outcomes that neither one
could do alone on their own. 01:21Consider the game of chess. You probably knew that AI today
can beat any human grandmaster. But did you know that the combination
of a human chess player and AI can beat not only any human
but also any machine. The combination is much more powerful
than the sum of its parts. In a perfect combination,
AI will do what it does best, which is dealing with massive amounts
of data and solving complex problems. And humans do what we do best using our creativity, our judgment,
our empathy, our ethics and our ability to compromise. 01:59For several years, my colleagues and I have studied and worked with hundreds
of winning companies who are successfully building
these human-AI relationships. And what we've seen is quite interesting. First of all, these companies get
five times more financial value than companies who use AI
only to replace people. Most importantly,
they have a happier workforce. Their employees are more
proud, more fulfilled, they collaborate better with each other,
and they're more effective. Five times more value
and a happier workforce. 02:33So the question is,
how do these companies do it? How do they achieve these symbiotic
human-AI relationships? I have some answers. First of all, they don't think of AI
in the most extreme case only to replace humans. Instead, they look deep
inside their organizations and at the various roles
their people play. And they ask: How can AI make our people
more fulfilled, more effective, more amplified? Let me give you an example. Humana is a health care
company here in the US. It has pharmacy call centers
where pharmacists work with patients over the phone. It's a job that requires a fair amount
of empathy and humanity. Humana has developed an AI system that listens to the
pharmacists' conversation and picks up emotional and tone signals and then gives real-time
suggestions to the pharmacists on how to improve the quality
of that conversation. For example, it might say
“Slow down” or “Pause” or ""Hey, consider how the other person
is feeling right now."" All to improve the quality
of that conversation. I'm pretty sure my wife
would buy me one of these if she could, just to help me in some
of my conversations with her. 03:48(Laughter) 03:49Turns out the pharmacists
like it quite a lot, too. They're more effective in their jobs, but they also learn something
about themselves, their own behaviors and biases. The result has been
more effective pharmacists and much higher customer
satisfaction scores. 04:05Now, this is just one example of many
possibilities where human AI collaborate. In this example, AI was a recommender. It didn't replace the human
or make any decisions of its own. It simply made suggestions, and it was up to the person
to decide and act. And at the heart of it is a feedback loop, which, by the way, is very critical
for any human-AI relationship. By that I mean that in this example, first AI had to learn from humans
the qualities that would make up a good or not so good conversation. And then over time,
as AI built more intelligence, it would be able to make suggestions, but it would be up to the person
to decide and act. And if they didn't agree
with the recommendation because it might have not
made sense to them, they didn't have to. In which case AI might learn something
and adapt for the future. It's basically open, frequent,
two-way communication, like any couples therapist will tell you, is very important for any
good relationship. 05:11Now the key word here is relationship. Think about your own personal
relationships with other people. You don't have the same kind
of relationship with your accountant or your boss or your spouse, do you? Well, I certainly hope not. And just like that, the right relationship
between human and AI in a company is not a one-size-fits-all. So in the case of Humana,
AI was a recommender and a human was decision-maker and actor. In some other examples,
AI might be an evaluator where a human comes up
with ideas or scenarios, and AI evaluates the complex implications
and tradeoffs of those ideas and makes it easy for humans to decide
the best course of action. In some other examples,
AI might take a more creative role. It could be an illuminator
where it can take a complex problem and come up with potential
solutions to that problem and illuminate some options that might have been impossible
for humans to see. 06:14Let me give you another example. During the COVID pandemic, if you walked into a retail
or grocery store, you saw that many retailers
were struggling. Their shelves were empty, their suppliers were not able
to fulfill the orders, and with all the uncertainties
of the pandemic, they simply had no idea how many people
would be walking into what stores, demanding what products. Now, to put this in perspective, this is a problem that's already quite
hard when things are normal. Retailers have to predict demand for tens of thousands of products
across thousands of locations and thousands of suppliers every day to manage and optimize their inventory. Add to that the uncertainties of COVID
and the global supply chain disruptions, and this became 100 times more difficult. And many retailers were simply paralyzed. But there were a few who had built
strong foundations with AI and the human-AI feedback loop
that we talked about. And these guys were able
to navigate all this uncertainty much better than others. They used AI to analyze
tens of billions of data points on consumer behavior
and global supply chain disruptions and local government closures and mandates and traffic on highways and ocean freight lanes and many,
many other factors and get a pretty good handle on what
consumers in each unique area wanted the most, what would have been feasible, and for items that were not available, what substitutions could be made. But AI alone without the human touch
wouldn't work either. There were ethical and economic tradeoffs
that had to be considered. For example, deciding
to bring in a product that didn't have a good margin
for the retailer but would really help support
the local community at their time of need. After all, AI couldn't quite understand the uniquely human behavior
of panic-buying toilet paper or tens of gallons of liquor, only to be used as hand sanitizer. It was the combination that was the key. 08:22And the winning companies know this. They also know that inside
their companies, there's literally hundreds of these
opportunities for human-AI combination, and they actively identify
and pursue them. They think of AI as much more broadly
a means to replace people. They look inside their organizations and re-imagine how the biggest challenges
and opportunities of their company can be addressed by the combination of human and AI. And they put in place the right
combination for each unique situation. Whether it's the recommender
or the evaluator or the illuminator or optimizer
or many, many other ones. They build and evolve the feedback loops
that we talked about. And finally and most importantly,
they don't just throw technology at it. In fact, this has been
the biggest pitfall of companies who don't get their return
from their AI investments. If they overinvest in technology expecting a piece of tech
to solve all their problems. But there is no silver bullet. Technology and automation
can only go so far, and for every one automation
opportunity inside a company, there's literally ten for collaboration. But collaboration's hard. It requires a new mindset and doing things differently
than how we've always done it. 09:44And the winning companies
know this, too, which is why they don't just
invest in technology, but so much more on human factors, on their people,
on training and reskilling and reimagining how their people
and AI work together in new ways. Inside these companies,
it's not just machines replacing humans. It's machines and humans working together, learning from each other. And when that happens, the organization's overall rate
of learning increases, which in turn makes the company
much more agile, much more resilient, ready to adapt
and take on any challenge. It is the human touch

1,The danger of AI is weirder than you think,Janelle Shane,Oct 2019,"The danger of artificial intelligence isn't that it's going to rebel against us, but that it's going to do exactly what we ask it to do, says AI researcher Janelle Shane. Sharing the weird, sometimes alarming antics of AI algorithms as they try to solve human problems -- like creating new ice cream flavors or recognizing cars on the road -- Shane shows why AI doesn't yet measure up to real brains.", (95K),"Transcript (25 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeČeštinaРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:01So, artificial intelligence is known for disrupting
all kinds of industries. What about ice cream? What kind of mind-blowing
new flavors could we generate with the power of an advanced
artificial intelligence? So I teamed up with a group of coders
from Kealing Middle School to find out the answer to this question. They collected over 1,600
existing ice cream flavors, and together, we fed them to an algorithm
to see what it would generate. And here are some of the flavors
that the AI came up with. 00:40[Pumpkin Trash Break] 00:41(Laughter) 00:43[Peanut Butter Slime] 00:46[Strawberry Cream Disease] 00:48(Laughter) 00:50These flavors are not delicious,
as we might have hoped they would be. So the question is: What happened? What went wrong? Is the AI trying to kill us? Or is it trying to do what we asked,
and there was a problem? 01:06In movies, when something
goes wrong with AI, it's usually because the AI has decided that it doesn't want to obey
the humans anymore, and it's got its own goals,
thank you very much. In real life, though,
the AI that we actually have is not nearly smart enough for that. It has the approximate computing power of an earthworm, or maybe at most a single honeybee, and actually, probably maybe less. Like, we're constantly learning
new things about brains that make it clear how much our AIs
don't measure up to real brains. So today's AI can do a task
like identify a pedestrian in a picture, but it doesn't have a concept
of what the pedestrian is beyond that it's a collection
of lines and textures and things. It doesn't know what a human actually is. So will today's AI
do what we ask it to do? It will if it can, but it might not do what we actually want. 02:04So let's say that you
were trying to get an AI to take this collection of robot parts and assemble them into some kind of robot
to get from Point A to Point B. Now, if you were going to try
and solve this problem by writing a traditional-style
computer program, you would give the program
step-by-step instructions on how to take these parts, how to assemble them
into a robot with legs and then how to use those legs
to walk to Point B. But when you're using AI
to solve the problem, it goes differently. You don't tell it
how to solve the problem, you just give it the goal, and it has to figure out for itself
via trial and error how to reach that goal. And it turns out that the way AI tends
to solve this particular problem is by doing this: it assembles itself into a tower
and then falls over and lands at Point B. And technically, this solves the problem. Technically, it got to Point B. The danger of AI is not that
it's going to rebel against us, it's that it's going to do
exactly what we ask it to do. So then the trick
of working with AI becomes: How do we set up the problem
so that it actually does what we want? 03:14So this little robot here
is being controlled by an AI. The AI came up with a design
for the robot legs and then figured out how to use them
to get past all these obstacles. But when David Ha set up this experiment, he had to set it up
with very, very strict limits on how big the AI
was allowed to make the legs, because otherwise ... 03:43(Laughter) 03:48And technically, it got
to the end of that obstacle course. So you see how hard it is to get AI
to do something as simple as just walk. 03:57So seeing the AI do this,
you may say, OK, no fair, you can't just be
a tall tower and fall over, you have to actually, like,
use legs to walk. And it turns out,
that doesn't always work, either. This AI's job was to move fast. They didn't tell it that it had
to run facing forward or that it couldn't use its arms. So this is what you get
when you train AI to move fast, you get things like somersaulting
and silly walks. It's really common. So is twitching along the floor in a heap. 04:32(Laughter) 04:35So in my opinion, you know what
should have been a whole lot weirder is the ""Terminator"" robots. Hacking ""The Matrix"" is another thing
that AI will do if you give it a chance. So if you train an AI in a simulation, it will learn how to do things like
hack into the simulation's math errors and harvest them for energy. Or it will figure out how to move faster
by glitching repeatedly into the floor. When you're working with AI, it's less like working with another human and a lot more like working
with some kind of weird force of nature. And it's really easy to accidentally
give AI the wrong problem to solve, and often we don't realize that
until something has actually gone wrong. 05:16So here's an experiment I did, where I wanted the AI
to copy paint colors, to invent new paint colors, given the list like the ones
here on the left. And here's what the AI
actually came up with. 05:29[Sindis Poop, Turdly, Suffer, Gray Pubic] 05:32(Laughter) 05:39So technically, it did what I asked it to. I thought I was asking it for,
like, nice paint color names, but what I was actually asking it to do was just imitate the kinds
of letter combinations that it had seen in the original. And I didn't tell it anything
about what words mean, or that there are maybe some words that it should avoid using
in these paint colors. So its entire world
is the data that I gave it. Like with the ice cream flavors,
it doesn't know about anything else. 06:12So it is through the data that we often accidentally tell AI
to do the wrong thing. This is a fish called a tench. And there was a group of researchers who trained an AI to identify
this tench in pictures. But then when they asked it what part of the picture it was actually
using to identify the fish, here's what it highlighted. Yes, those are human fingers. Why would it be looking for human fingers if it's trying to identify a fish? Well, it turns out that the tench
is a trophy fish, and so in a lot of pictures
that the AI had seen of this fish during training, the fish looked like this. 06:51(Laughter) 06:53And it didn't know that the fingers
aren't part of the fish. 06:58So you see why it is so hard
to design an AI that actually can understand
what it's looking at. And this is why designing
the image recognition in self-driving cars is so hard, and why so many self-driving car failures are because the AI got confused. I want to talk about an example from 2016. There was a fatal accident when somebody
was using Tesla's autopilot AI, but instead of using it on the highway
like it was designed for, they used it on city streets. And what happened was, a truck drove out in front of the car
and the car failed to brake. Now, the AI definitely was trained
to recognize trucks in pictures. But what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize
trucks on highway driving, where you would expect
to see trucks from behind. Trucks on the side is not supposed
to happen on a highway, and so when the AI saw this truck, it looks like the AI recognized it
as most likely to be a road sign and therefore, safe to drive underneath. 08:04Here's an AI misstep
from a different field. Amazon recently had to give up
on a résumé-sorting algorithm that they were working on when they discovered that the algorithm
had learned to discriminate against women. What happened is they had trained it
on example résumés of people who they had hired in the past. And from these examples, the AI learned
to avoid the résumés of people who had gone to women's colleges or who had the word ""women""
somewhere in their resume, as in, ""women's soccer team""
or ""Society of Women Engineers."" The AI didn't know that it wasn't supposed
to copy this particular thing that it had seen the humans do. And technically, it did
what they asked it to do. They just accidentally asked it
to do the wrong thing. 08:46And this happens all the time with AI. AI can be really destructive
and not know it. So the AIs that recommend
new content in Facebook, in YouTube, they're optimized to increase
the number of clicks and views. And unfortunately, one way
that they have found of doing this is to recommend the content
of conspiracy theories or bigotry. The AIs themselves don't have any concept
of what this content actually is, and they don't have any concept
of what the consequences might be of recommending this content. 09:22So, when we're working with AI, it's up to us to avoid problems. And avoiding things going wrong, that may come down to
the age-old problem of communication, where we as humans have to learn
how to communicate with AI. We have to learn what AI
is capable of doing and what it's not, and to understand that,
with its tiny little worm brain, AI doesn't really understand
what we're trying to ask it to do. So in other words, we have
to be prepared to work with AI that's not the super-competent,
all-knowing AI of science fiction. We have to be prepared to work with an AI that's the one that we actually have
in the present day. And present-day AI is plenty weird enough. 10:09Thank you. 10:11(Applause)"

doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, 
and city planners predict traffic. But no matter what these AIs are doing,
the computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly 
how they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence 
is often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array 
of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? 00:39There are many different ways 
to build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three 
basic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying
to pull information from a set of medical data containing
thousands of patient profiles. 01:01First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal
for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities
and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar
disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces
specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach 
can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles 
and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. 01:28But let's imagine doctors are looking
for something more specific. These physicians want 
to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently 
it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those
features’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm 
for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have 
an active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy 
of the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use
the updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters 
and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called
supervised learning. 02:27Now, let’s say these doctors want 
to design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans
will be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each
individual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use
reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach
to gather feedback about which medications, dosages 
and treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data 
against each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal 
treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program
receives more feedback, it can constantly update 
the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are
inherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less 
human intervention, they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses which makes them best suited
for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can 
supervise and teach each other. For example, 
when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected 
supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate 
this information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement
learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback 
about different treatment plans. 03:43There are numerous ways to create
these machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship 
between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use
millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like 
image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed
these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught 
algorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways 
to make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved
in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have
increasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning 
to investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them 
to teach each other to operate ethically."

Tom Gruber, co-creator of Siri, wants to make ""humanistic AI"" that augments and collaborates with us instead of competing with (or replacing) us.

a new way to think about my field, artificial intelligence. I think the purpose of AI is to empower humans
with machine intelligence. And as machines get smarter, we get smarter. I call this ""humanistic AI"" -- artificial intelligence
designed to meet human needs by collaborating and augmenting people. Now, today I'm happy to see that the idea of an intelligent assistant is mainstream. It's the well-accepted metaphor
for the interface between humans and AI. And the one I helped create
is called Siri. 00:42footnotefootnoteYou know Siri. Siri is the thing that knows your intent and helps you do it for you, helps you get things done. But what you might not know
is that we designed Siri as humanistic AI, to augment people
with a conversational interface that made it possible for them
to use mobile computing, regardless of who they were
and their abilities. 01:06Now for most of us, the impact of this technology is to make things
a little bit easier to use. But for my friend Daniel, the impact of the AI
in these systems is a life changer. You see, Daniel is a really social guy, and he's blind and quadriplegic, which makes it hard to use those devices
that we all take for granted. The last time I was at his house,
his brother said, ""Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready. He's on the phone with a woman
he met online."" I'm like, ""That's cool, how'd he do it?"" Well, Daniel uses Siri
to manage his own social life -- his email, text and phone -- without depending on his caregivers. This is kind of interesting, right? The irony here is great. Here's the man whose relationship with AI helps him have relationships
with genuine human beings. And this is humanistic AI. 02:07footnotefootnoteAnother example with
life-changing consequences is diagnosing cancer. When a doctor suspects cancer, they take a sample
and send it to a pathologist, who looks at it under a microscope. Now, pathologists look at
hundreds of slides and millions of cells every day. So to support this task, some researchers made an AI classifier. Now, the classifier says,
""Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"" looking at the pictures. The classifier was pretty good, but not as good as the person, who got it right most of the time. 02:46But when they combine the ability
of the machine and the human together, accuracy went to 99.5 percent. Adding that AI to a partnership
eliminated 85 percent of the errors that the human pathologist
would have made working alone. That's a lot of cancer
that would have otherwise gone untreated. Now, for the curious, it turns out that the human was better
at rejecting false positives, and the machine was better
at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases. But the lesson here isn't about
which agent is better at this image-classification task. Those things are changing every day. The lesson here is that by combining the abilities
of the human and machine, it created a partnership
that had superhuman performance. And that is humanistic AI. 03:42Now let's look at another example with turbocharging performance. This is design. Now, let's say you're an engineer. You want to design
a new frame for a drone. You get out your favorite
software tools, CAD tools, and you enter the form and the materials,
and then you analyze performance. That gives you one design. If you give those same tools to an AI, it can generate thousands of designs. 04:10footnotefootnoteThis video by Autodesk is amazing. This is real stuff. So this transforms how we do design. The human engineer now says what the design should achieve, and the machine says, ""Here's the possibilities."" Now in her job, the engineer's job is to pick the one that best meets
the goals of the design, which she knows as a human
better than anyone else, using human judgment and expertise. In this case, the winning form looks kind of like something
nature would have designed, minus a few million years of evolution and all that unnecessary fur. 04:48footnotefootnoteNow let's see where this idea
of humanistic AI might lead us if we follow it into
the speculative beyond. What's a kind of augmentation
that we would all like to have? Well, how about cognitive enhancement? Instead of asking, ""How smart can we make our machines?"" let's ask ""How smart can our machines make us?"" I mean, take memory for example. Memory is the foundation
of human intelligence. But human memory is famously flawed. We're great at telling stories, but not getting the details right. And our memories -- they decay over time. I mean, like, where did the '60s go,
and can I go there, too? 05:34(Laughter) 05:36But what if you could have a memory
that was as good as computer memory, and was about your life? What if you could remember
every person you ever met, how to pronounce their name, their family details,
their favorite sports, the last conversation you had with them? If you had this memory all your life, you could have the AI look
at all the interactions you had with people over time and help you reflect on the long arc
of your relationships. What if you could have the AI read
everything you've ever read and listen to every song
you've ever heard? From the tiniest clue,
it could help you retrieve anything you've ever seen or heard before. Imagine what that would do
for the ability to make new connections and form new ideas. 06:26And what about our bodies? What if we could remember the consequences
of every food we eat, every pill we take, every all-nighter we pull? We could do our own science
on our own data about what makes us feel
good and stay healthy. And imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage
allergies and chronic disease. 06:52I believe that AI will make
personal memory enhancement a reality. I can't say when or what
form factors are involved, but I think it's inevitable, because the very things
that make AI successful today -- the availability of comprehensive data and the ability for machines
to make sense of that data -- can be applied to the data of our lives. And those data are here today,
available for all of us, because we lead digitally mediated lives, in mobile and online. 07:31In my view, a personal memory
is a private memory. We get to choose what is and is not
recalled and retained. It's absolutely essential
that this be kept very secure. 07:45Now for most of us, the impact of augmented personal memory will be a more improved mental gain, maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace. But for the millions who suffer
from Alzheimer's and dementia, the difference that augmented
memory could make is a difference
between a life of isolation and a life of dignity and connection. 08:12We are in the middle of a renaissance
in artificial intelligence right now. I mean, in just the past few years, we're beginning to see
solutions to AI problems that we have struggled
with literally for decades: speech understanding, text understanding, image understanding. We have a choice in how we use
this powerful technology. We can choose to use AI
to automate and compete with us, or we can use AI to augment
and collaborate with us, to overcome our cognitive limitations and to help us do what we want to do, only better. And as we discover new ways
to give machines intelligence, we can distribute that intelligence to all of the AI assistants in the world, and therefore to every person,
regardless of circumstance. And that is why, every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter. 09:21That is an AI worth spreading. 09:24Thank you. 09:25(Applause)"

of artificial intelligence, very often, they invoke images
of humanoid robots run amok. You know? Terminator? You know, that might be
something to consider, but that's a distant threat. Or, we fret about digital surveillance with metaphors from the past. ""1984,"" George Orwell's ""1984,"" it's hitting the bestseller lists again. It's a great book, but it's not the correct dystopia
for the 21st century. What we need to fear most is not what artificial intelligence
will do to us on its own, but how the people in power
will use artificial intelligence to control us and to manipulate us in novel, sometimes hidden, subtle and unexpected ways. Much of the technology that threatens our freedom
and our dignity in the near-term future is being developed by companies in the business of capturing
and selling our data and our attention to advertisers and others: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent. 01:14Now, artificial intelligence has started
bolstering their business as well. And it may seem
like artificial intelligence is just the next thing after online ads. It's not. It's a jump in category. It's a whole different world, and it has great potential. It could accelerate our understanding
of many areas of study and research. But to paraphrase
a famous Hollywood philosopher, ""With prodigious potential
comes prodigious risk."" 01:49Now let's look at a basic fact
of our digital lives, online ads. Right? We kind of dismiss them. They seem crude, ineffective. We've all had the experience
of being followed on the web by an ad based on something
we searched or read. You know, you look up a pair of boots and for a week, those boots are following
you around everywhere you go. Even after you succumb and buy them,
they're still following you around. We're kind of inured to that kind
of basic, cheap manipulation. We roll our eyes and we think,
""You know what? These things don't work."" Except, online, the digital technologies are not just ads. Now, to understand that,
let's think of a physical world example. You know how, at the checkout counters
at supermarkets, near the cashier, there's candy and gum
at the eye level of kids? That's designed to make them
whine at their parents just as the parents
are about to sort of check out. Now, that's a persuasion architecture. It's not nice, but it kind of works. That's why you see it
in every supermarket. Now, in the physical world, such persuasion architectures
are kind of limited, because you can only put
so many things by the cashier. Right? And the candy and gum,
it's the same for everyone, even though it mostly works only for people who have
whiny little humans beside them. In the physical world,
we live with those limitations. 03:22In the digital world, though, persuasion architectures
can be built at the scale of billions and they can target, infer, understand and be deployed at individuals one by one by figuring out your weaknesses, and they can be sent
to everyone's phone private screen, so it's not visible to us. And that's different. And that's just one of the basic things
that artificial intelligence can do. 03:52Now, let's take an example. Let's say you want to sell
plane tickets to Vegas. Right? So in the old world, you could think
of some demographics to target based on experience
and what you can guess. You might try to advertise to, oh, men between the ages of 25 and 35, or people who have
a high limit on their credit card, or retired couples. Right? That's what you would do in the past. 04:16With big data and machine learning, that's not how it works anymore. So to imagine that, think of all the data
that Facebook has on you: every status update you ever typed, every Messenger conversation, every place you logged in from, all your photographs
that you uploaded there. If you start typing something
and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those
and analyzes them, too. Increasingly, it tries
to match you with your offline data. It also purchases
a lot of data from data brokers. It could be everything
from your financial records to a good chunk of your browsing history. Right? In the US,
such data is routinely collected, collated and sold. In Europe, they have tougher rules. 05:11So what happens then is, by churning through all that data,
these machine-learning algorithms -- that's why they're called
learning algorithms -- they learn to understand
the characteristics of people who purchased tickets to Vegas before. When they learn this from existing data, they also learn
how to apply this to new people. So if they're presented with a new person, they can classify whether that person
is likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not. Fine. You're thinking,
an offer to buy tickets to Vegas. I can ignore that. But the problem isn't that. The problem is, we no longer really understand
how these complex algorithms work. We don't understand
how they're doing this categorization. It's giant matrices,
thousands of rows and columns, maybe millions of rows and columns, and not the programmers and not anybody who looks at it, even if you have all the data, understands anymore
how exactly it's operating any more than you'd know
what I was thinking right now if you were shown
a cross section of my brain. It's like we're not programming anymore, we're growing intelligence
that we don't truly understand. 06:40And these things only work
if there's an enormous amount of data, so they also encourage
deep surveillance on all of us so that the machine learning
algorithms can work. That's why Facebook wants
to collect all the data it can about you. The algorithms work better. 06:56So let's push that Vegas example a bit. What if the system
that we do not understand was picking up that it's easier
to sell Vegas tickets to people who are bipolar
and about to enter the manic phase. Such people tend to become
overspenders, compulsive gamblers. They could do this, and you'd have no clue
that's what they were picking up on. I gave this example
to a bunch of computer scientists once and afterwards, one of them came up to me. He was troubled and he said,
""That's why I couldn't publish it."" I was like, ""Couldn't publish what?"" He had tried to see whether you can indeed
figure out the onset of mania from social media posts
before clinical symptoms, and it had worked, and it had worked very well, and he had no idea how it worked
or what it was picking up on. 07:54Now, the problem isn't solved
if he doesn't publish it, because there are already companies that are developing
this kind of technology, and a lot of the stuff
is just off the shelf. This is not very difficult anymore. 08:09Do you ever go on YouTube
meaning to watch one video and an hour later you've watched 27? You know how YouTube
has this column on the right that says, ""Up next"" and it autoplays something? It's an algorithm picking what it thinks
that you might be interested in and maybe not find on your own. It's not a human editor. It's what algorithms do. It picks up on what you have watched
and what people like you have watched, and infers that that must be
what you're interested in, what you want more of, and just shows you more. It sounds like a benign
and useful feature, except when it isn't. 08:49So in 2016, I attended rallies
of then-candidate Donald Trump to study as a scholar
the movement supporting him. I study social movements,
so I was studying it, too. And then I wanted to write something
about one of his rallies, so I watched it a few times on YouTube. YouTube started recommending to me and autoplaying to me
white supremacist videos in increasing order of extremism. If I watched one, it served up one even more extreme and autoplayed that one, too. If you watch Hillary Clinton
or Bernie Sanders content, YouTube recommends
and autoplays conspiracy left, and it goes downhill from there. 09:40Well, you might be thinking,
this is politics, but it's not. This isn't about politics. This is just the algorithm
figuring out human behavior. I once watched a video
about vegetarianism on YouTube and YouTube recommended
and autoplayed a video about being vegan. It's like you're never
hardcore enough for YouTube. 10:00(Laughter) 10:02So what's going on? Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary, but here's what I think is going on. The algorithm has figured out that if you can entice people into thinking that you can
show them something more hardcore, they're more likely to stay on the site watching video after video
going down that rabbit hole while Google serves them ads. Now, with nobody minding
the ethics of the store, these sites can profile people who are Jew haters, who think that Jews are parasites and who have such explicit
anti-Semitic content, and let you target them with ads. They can also mobilize algorithms to find for you look-alike audiences, people who do not have such explicit
anti-Semitic content on their profile but who the algorithm detects
may be susceptible to such messages, and lets you target them with ads, too. Now, this may sound
like an implausible example, but this is real. ProPublica investigated this and found that you can indeed
do this on Facebook, and Facebook helpfully
offered up suggestions on how to broaden that audience. BuzzFeed tried it for Google,
and very quickly they found, yep, you can do it on Google, too. And it wasn't even expensive. The ProPublica reporter
spent about 30 dollars to target this category. 11:50So last year, Donald Trump's
social media manager disclosed that they were using Facebook dark posts
to demobilize people, not to persuade them, but to convince them not to vote at all. And to do that,
they targeted specifically, for example, African-American men
in key cities like Philadelphia, and I'm going to read
exactly what he said. I'm quoting. 12:17They were using ""nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that only the people
we want to see it see it. We modeled this. It will dramatically affect her ability
to turn these people out."" 12:33What's in those dark posts? We have no idea. Facebook won't tell us. 12:40So Facebook also algorithmically
arranges the posts that your friends put on Facebook,
or the pages you follow. It doesn't show you
everything chronologically. It puts the order in the way
that the algorithm thinks will entice you to stay on the site longer. 12:59Now, so this has a lot of consequences. You may be thinking
somebody is snubbing you on Facebook. The algorithm may never
be showing your post to them. The algorithm is prioritizing
some of them and burying the others. 13:17Experiments show that what the algorithm picks to show you
can affect your emotions. But that's not all. It also affects political behavior. So in 2010, in the midterm elections, Facebook did an experiment
on 61 million people in the US that was disclosed after the fact. So some people were shown,
""Today is election day,"" the simpler one, and some people were shown
the one with that tiny tweak with those little thumbnails of your friends who clicked on ""I voted."" This simple tweak. OK? So the pictures were the only change, and that post shown just once turned out an additional 340,000 voters in that election, according to this research as confirmed by the voter rolls. A fluke? No. Because in 2012,
they repeated the same experiment. And that time, that civic message shown just once turned out an additional 270,000 voters. For reference, the 2016
US presidential election was decided by about 100,000 votes. Now, Facebook can also
very easily infer what your politics are, even if you've never
disclosed them on the site. Right? These algorithms
can do that quite easily. What if a platform with that kind of power decides to turn out supporters
of one candidate over the other? How would we even know about it? 15:13Now, we started from someplace
seemingly innocuous -- online adds following us around -- and we've landed someplace else. As a public and as citizens, we no longer know
if we're seeing the same information or what anybody else is seeing, and without a common basis of information, little by little, public debate is becoming impossible, and we're just at
the beginning stages of this. These algorithms can quite easily infer things like your people's ethnicity, religious and political views,
personality traits, intelligence, happiness,
use of addictive substances, parental separation, age and genders, just from Facebook likes. These algorithms can identify protesters even if their faces
are partially concealed. These algorithms may be able
to detect people's sexual orientation just from their dating profile pictures. 16:21Now, these are probabilistic guesses, so they're not going
to be 100 percent right, but I don't see the powerful resisting
the temptation to use these technologies just because there are
some false positives, which will of course create
a whole other layer of problems. Imagine what a state can do with the immense amount of data
it has on its citizens. China is already using
face detection technology to identify and arrest people. And here's the tragedy: we're building this infrastructure
of surveillance authoritarianism merely to get people to click on ads. And this won't be
Orwell's authoritarianism. This isn't ""1984."" Now, if authoritarianism
is using overt fear to terrorize us, we'll all be scared, but we'll know it, we'll hate it and we'll resist it. But if the people in power
are using these algorithms to quietly watch us, to judge us and to nudge us, to predict and identify
the troublemakers and the rebels, to deploy persuasion
architectures at scale and to manipulate individuals one by one using their personal, individual
weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and if they're doing it at scale through our private screens so that we don't even know what our fellow citizens
and neighbors are seeing, that authoritarianism
will envelop us like a spider's web and we may not even know we're in it. 18:10So Facebook's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars. It's because it works great
as a persuasion architecture. But the structure of that architecture is the same whether you're selling shoes or whether you're selling politics. The algorithms do not know the difference. The same algorithms set loose upon us to make us more pliable for ads are also organizing our political,
personal and social information flows, and that's what's got to change. 18:50Now, don't get me wrong, we use digital platforms
because they provide us with great value. I use Facebook to keep in touch
with friends and family around the world. I've written about how crucial
social media is for social movements. I have studied how
these technologies can be used to circumvent censorship around the world. But it's not that the people who run,
you know, Facebook or Google are maliciously and deliberately trying to make the country
or the world more polarized and encourage extremism. I read the many
well-intentioned statements that these people put out. But it's not the intent or the statements
people in technology make that matter, it's the structures
and business models they're building. And that's the core of the problem. Either Facebook is a giant con
of half a trillion dollars and ads don't work on the site, it doesn't work
as a persuasion architecture, or its power of influence
is of great concern. It's either one or the other. It's similar for Google, too. 20:12So what can we do? This needs to change. Now, I can't offer a simple recipe, because we need to restructure the whole way our
digital technology operates. Everything from the way
technology is developed to the way the incentives,
economic and otherwise, are built into the system. We have to face and try to deal with the lack of transparency
created by the proprietary algorithms, the structural challenge
of machine learning's opacity, all this indiscriminate data
that's being collected about us. We have a big task in front of us. We have to mobilize our technology, our creativity and yes, our politics so that we can build
artificial intelligence that supports us in our human goals but that is also constrained
by our human values. And I understand this won't be easy. We might not even easily agree
on what those terms mean. But if we take seriously how these systems that we
depend on for so much operate, I don't see how we can postpone
this conversation anymore. These structures are organizing how we function and they're controlling what we can and we cannot do. And many of these ad-financed platforms, they boast that they're free. In this context, it means
that we are the product that's being sold. We need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest-bidding
authoritarian or demagogue. 22:11(Applause) 22:18So to go back to
that Hollywood paraphrase, we do want the prodigious potential of artificial intelligence
and digital technology to blossom, but for that, we must face
this prodigious menace, open-eyed and now. 22:36Thank you. 22:37(Applause)"

Sharing her melodic gifts with the world, multidisciplinary artist Holly Herndon introduces Holly+, an AI-powered instrument that lets people sing with her own voice. Musician Pher joins her onstage to demonstrate this mind-blowing tech while singing into two microphones -- one that amplifies his natural voice and another that makes him sound just like Holly.", (31K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishItalianoPortuguês de Portugalالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)00:00(Overlapping voices sing) 00:26(Singing ends) 00:28(Applause) 00:31Hi, my name is Holly, and I’m an artist. That was my voice, but I didn’t sing that clip. I trained an AI on my own voice, and now she can sing anything
in multiple languages. Her name is Holly+, and you just heard her perform
“El Cant de la Sibilla,” which is a traditional song
arranged by Maria Arnal in Catalan. Not a language that I speak and not a vocal tradition
that I've trained in. Those melismatic runs
are really difficult to hit. 01:01To show you Holly+'s full range,
I'll also play an example in German. This is ""Mack the Knife"" by Brecht. 01:08(Singing in German) 01:21(Music ends) 01:24Of course Holly+ can -- thank you. 01:27(Applause) 01:29Of course, Holly+ can also
perform my own music, so here's an excerpt
from my own song, ""Frontier."" 01:36(Singing ""Frontier"" in overlapping voices) 01:45(Singing ends) 01:47Holly+ uses a process
called timbre transfer, where the timbre,
or sound quality of one sound, may be mapped onto
the performance of another. Timbre transfer is done by creating
a machine-learning model of a sound. In this case, it's my voice. So I recorded a wide variety of phrases
in my entire vocal range. To be clear, this version of Holly+
is reading notes from a score. So I'll also play you an example
of her singing in Spanish, “Bésame Mucho” by Velázquez. 02:22(Music: ""Bésame Mucho"") 02:37(Music ends) 02:41Thank you. 02:42(Applause) 02:43I can't speak Spanish, by the way, so. 02:47Teaching an AI the sonic
properties of one sound in order to generate an entirely new sound is what I like to call ""spawning."" Spawning is what allows Holly+
to create a wide range of vocals that I didn't sing from a set of recorded phrases
that I did sing. I like to think of spawning
as a kind of 21st-century corollary to the musical tradition of sampling, which had a really big impact on both
music and intellectual property. But I think spawning is far more exciting
and potentially really weird. 03:20(Laughter) 03:21So, for example, with sampling, usually you copy and remix a recording
by someone else to create something new. But with spawning,
you can perform as someone else based on trained information about them. And as an artist, this is making me
rethink my own past work as not only my archive but potentially also I myself
could become reanimated with AI. This also opens up the question of how we deal with
a collective human archive if we can reanimate old media. It opens up really big ethical and intellectual property questions that require entirely new
conceptual and legal frameworks. 04:04One way that I like to think
about intellectual property I call identity play. So rather than limiting
the use of my voice, I'm creating instruments
to allow as many people as possible to create music with me, and even as me. That's why I've made versions
of Holly+ freely available for anyone to use online. If I can allow people to play with my IP, my digital identity,
my intellectual property, what might they come up with? Could someone else go on tour as me,
with my permission? Could I be in a thousand different
bands in multiple languages? And what would that even sound like? 04:46To be clear, musicians have been taught
to be really protective over our IP, and that's for really good reason. But I'm trying to think of ways to make
this new capability mutually beneficial. So to allow people to use my voice but still to maintain the ability
to approve certain derivative works. 05:05So I invite you to consider,
if given the opportunity, who would you like to perform through? And can you imagine someone
else performing you? With that in mind, I'd like to invite the incredible
musician Pher to the stage. 05:20(Applause) 05:25So today, Pher will be performing
his own song, ""Murky."" And with one microphone you'll hear
Pher's beautiful, natural voice. 05:33(Pher vocalizing) 05:37(Audience cheers) 05:40And with this microphone, you'll hear a live version of Holly+
developed with Voctro Labs. 05:48(Pher vocalizing in Holly+ voice) 05:52(Laughter and applause) 05:57Take it away Pher. 06:01(Pher singing ""Murky"") 06:02It gets so murky 06:07Loving what you know 06:11But I, I keep on swimming, 06:17I'm swimming 06:19Further up the road 06:24See, the problem is, 06:27I don't know what to say 06:30When you come around 06:33Acting this way 06:35Oh oh 06:38And, yes, the truth is 06:42I show you every day 06:47Cause you love to stay 06:51(Applause) 06:52Living in all the pain 06:56And it gets so murky 07:01Loving what you know 07:05But I'll keep on swimming 07:10Further up the road 07:15And I've been calling out 07:18Calling out your name 07:21Deep down in my sleep 07:25And I even memorized your face 07:30So ain't no leaving' me 07:35And I just handle my biz 07:39And keep the train moving on 07:44And you know what it is 07:48Is just you that 07:51I'm choosing 07:54Cause it gets so murky 08:00Loving what you know 08:05And I'll 08:08I'll keep on swimming 08:11Further up the road 08:16And it gets so murky 08:22Loving what you know 08:27And I’ll, 08:30I'll keep on swimming 08:34Further up the road 08:40Swimming 08:43I'm swimming 08:46Further up the road 08:52And I'll keep on swimming 08:56Swimming 08:59Further up the road 09:05(Vocalizing) 09:10(Cheers and applause) 09:16Holly Herndon: Thank you.

1,Intelligent floating machines inspired by nature,Anicka Yi,Aug 2022,"Taking cues from soft robotics and the natural world, conceptual artist Anicka Yi builds lighter-than-air machines that roam and react like autonomous life forms. Her floating ""aerobes"" inspire us to think about new ways of living with machines -- and to ponder how they could evolve into living creatures. ""What if our machines could be more than just our tools, and instead, a new type of companion species?"" she asks.", (35K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάالعربيةفارسىမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)00:00It’s wonderful to be in a room
with so many humans after all this time. In the last few years, I've been keeping company
with a new species that happens to live in the air. And I'd like you all to meet
my aerobe friend. 00:22(Music) 00:51(Music ends) 00:54(Cheers and applause) 00:59I get emotional every time I see it fly. 01:03In my work as an artist, I ask a lot of questions
about the world around me. While the problems of the world
don't have easy solutions, I think it's as important
to ask the right questions. Why do our technologies
instill so much fear in us? Why do our lives today feel so alienating, when our technologies
are supposed to improve our lives? And why do we feel so disconnected, when our inventions are meant to connect
each and every one of us? 01:42My artwork deals with evolution,
biology and the senses. I'm interested in how organisms
are composed of different life-forms, such as bacteria, fungi and viruses ... but also how different chemical
and molecular interactions can happen whenever we simply take a breath. 02:07So I've always found modern technology
to be quite limiting because of how cold and flat it is. But what if our machines
could be more holistic? And what if our machines
could relate to us in a more holistic way? And what if our machines
could be more than just our tools, and instead, a new type
of companion species? I believe we need to embrace
who we are as symbiotic living beings, and design machines to reflect this. What if the world
was populated by machines that were more like animals and plants, instead of something
you'd find in a factory? This exploration could teach us
so much more about life, in all its vast complexities. 03:06These ideas might sound
like mere science fiction, but my mission as an artist is to create
possibilities of other worlds, and other ways of living and being, even if just for a moment. 03:24So when I was invited to imagine
a large-scale installation at the Tate Modern in London, I decided to make this world
I'm describing a reality. The museum space is incredibly vast, and I knew right away
that I wanted to transform it into an aquarium of machines. I asked myself, ""What would it feel like to live
in the world with machines that could live in the wild
and evolve on their own?"" To explore this question, I created two new machine species
that I call ""aerobes."" I released 12 aerobes
into the museum space so they could form
their own small ecosystem. In order to minimize
our human-centric biases, and to steer clear
of simply mimicking the human form, I worked with my team
to look at the natural world, and we were inspired
by creatures like the comb jellyfish and the lion's mane mushroom. We also looked deeply
into the field of soft robotics, and ultimately brought the aerobes to life
by designing them with fluid movement and lighter-than-air construction. 04:46When you look at these aerobes, it gives you a feeling almost opposite
to the uncanny valley. You know that they're mechanical, yet they feel palpably alive. You feel like you might be next
to some majestic and remote life-form. Like swimming next to a humpback whale. Their size is imposing ... yet they inspire an emotion
closer to awe than to fear. You sense that they're almost living, and it makes you want to embrace and coexist with them, to see them truly succeed. 05:29I wanted the aerobes
to have a sense of freedom and unpredictability, so I worked with my team to create what is called
an artificial life simulation. This software allows each aerobe
to develop unique behaviors and to respond autonomously
to its environment. The aerobes evolve their personalities as they interact
and learn from each other. The more we flew them, the more we got to know
their distinct personalities and their gentle nature. It was very important for me that the aerobes
had their own sensory world. Most AI functions like a mind
without a body. But all living creatures, from the humble tick
to the stealthy panther, learn about the world
through their bodies and their senses. These aerobes perceive each other
through high-frequency radio waves, and they use thermal sensing to detect other living creatures
in their environment. An aerobe might be curious
about your heat signature, and fly over to greet and flirt with you, while other aerobes are more shy and might go out of their way
to avoid a crowd. 06:53How will these machines and humans
be together in the world? What will this world look like? This world may see machines and humans
generating new intimacies and alternate perspectives. My hope is that these aerobes
will help us appreciate a more diverse way of living and being. Their purpose is not
to compete with us or to dominate us, but to ask what a more compatible
future could look like. 07:31We all have a stake in this conversation
about technologies. Can we actively align machines
to better reflect our biological reality? I sincerely hope that you'll consider that machines can be so much more
than what we've known, and how they might embody
a wisdom drawn from biology. This project is a project for everybody, to imagine different worlds
and different futures. 08:05It's not too late to change
machine evolution and to consider new goals, where machines and humans can coexist in a more compassionate way. I believe this is where we can
start the conversation. 08:23(Applause) 08:32(Music) 09:42(Music ends) 09:59Thank you. 10:00(Cheers and applause)"

great to see you. How are you? 00:03Elon Musk: Good. How are you? 00:05CA: We're here at the Texas Gigafactory
the day before this thing opens. It's been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much
for making time on a busy day. 00:14I would love you to help us,
kind of, cast our minds, I don't know, 10, 20,
30 years into the future. And help us try to picture
what it would take to build a future that's worth
getting excited about. 00:29The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really
just a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other
reasons to do the work you're doing, but fundamentally, you want
to think about the future and not think that it sucks. 00:43EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there's a lot of discussion of like,
this problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad
about the future and they're ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want
to wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited
about what's going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable
problem after another. 01:22CA: So if you look forward 30 years,
you know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this
doomsday deadline on climate. There's a consensus of scientists,
a large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven't
completely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we're inviting
climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway
to avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? 01:56EM: Yeah, so I am not one
of the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we're on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards
a sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. So I can't emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard
and are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don't worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically,
it will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. 02:42So, like, there are three elements
to a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation,
which is primarily wind and solar. There's also hydro, geothermal, I'm actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it's going to be primarily
solar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries
to store the solar and wind energy because the sun
doesn't shine all the time, the wind doesn't blow all the time. So it's a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible
to make electric rockets, but you can make
the propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. 03:37So ultimately, we can have a fully
sustainable energy economy. And it's those three things: solar/wind, stationary
battery pack, electric vehicles. 03:48So then what are the limiting
factors on progress? The limiting factor really will be
battery cell production. So that's going to really be
the fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion
battery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor
on progress towards sustainability. 04:16CA: All right, so we need to talk
more about batteries, because the key thing
that I want to understand, like, there seems to be
a scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production
that the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That's the end goal? 04:40EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others
to check our calculations because they may arrive
at different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just
current electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount
of electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt
hours of installed capacity. 05:06CA: So we need to give people
a sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest
buildings in the world. What I've read, and tell me
if this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually
produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. 05:31EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there
within a couple of years. 05:37CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- 05:41EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. 05:43CA: But that's still 1/100
of what's needed. How much of the rest of that 100
is Tesla planning to take on let's say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see
the scale up happen? 06:01EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn't
hold me to these things. It's not like this is like some -- What tends to happen
is I'll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk
that writes an article: ""Elon said this would happen,
and it didn't happen. He's a liar and a fool."" It's very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses,
this is a conversation. 06:27CA: Right. 06:29EM: I think Tesla probably ends up
doing 10 percent of that. Roughly. 06:36CA: Let's say 2050 we have this amazing, you know,
100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture
of the sustainable energy sources you talked about. That same grid probably
is offering the world really low-cost energy, isn't it, compared with now. And I'm curious about like, are people entitled to get
a little bit excited about the possibilities of that world? 07:06EM: People should be optimistic
about the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy. It will happen if we, you know,
continue to push hard, the future is bright and good
from an energy standpoint. And then it will be possible to also use
that energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull
carbon out of the atmosphere because in putting it in the atmosphere
it releases energy. So now, you know, obviously
in order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you've got a lot of sustainable
energy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. So you can reverse the CO2 parts
per million of the atmosphere and oceans. And also you can really have
as much fresh water as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth “Water.” It's 70 percent water by surface area. Now most of that’s seawater, but it's like we just happen to be
on the bit that's land. 08:06CA: And with energy,
you can turn seawater into -- 08:09EM: Yes. 08:10CA: Irrigating water
or whatever water you need. 08:13EM: At very low cost. Things will be good. 08:16CA: Things will be good. And also, there's other benefits
to this non-fossil fuel world where the air is cleaner -- 08:21EM: Yes, exactly. Because, like, when you burn fossil fuels, there's all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds. And sort of little particulates
that are bad for your lungs. Like, there's all sorts
of bad things that are happening that will go away. And the sky will be cleaner and quieter. The future's going to be good. 08:46footnotefootnoteCA: I want us to switch now to think
a bit about artificial intelligence. But the segue there, you mentioned how annoying it is
when people call you up for bad predictions in the past. So I'm possibly going to be annoying now, but I’m curious about your timelines
and how you predict and how come some things are so amazingly
on the money and some aren't. So when it comes to predicting sales
of Tesla vehicles, for example, you've kind of been amazing, I think in 2014 when Tesla
had sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, ""2020, I think we will do
half a million a year."" 09:26EM: Yeah, we did
almost exactly a half million. 09:28CA: You did almost exactly half a million. You were scoffed in 2014
because no one since Henry Ford, with the Model T, had come close
to that kind of growth rate for cars. You were scoffed, and you actually
hit 500,000 cars and then 510,000 or whatever produced. 09:44But five years ago,
last time you came to TED, I asked you about full self-driving, and you said, “Yeah, this very year, I'm confident that we will have a car
going from LA to New York without any intervention."" 10:00EM: Yeah, I don't want to blow your mind,
but I'm not always right. CA: (Laughs) 10:05What's the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving in particular
been so hard to predict? 10:13EM: I mean, the thing that really got me, and I think it's going to get
a lot of other people, is that there are just so many
false dawns with self-driving, where you think you've got the problem, have a handle on the problem, and then it, no, turns out
you just hit a ceiling. Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. So it's like a series of log curves. So most people don't know
what a log curve is, I suppose. 10:45CA: Show the shape with your hands. 10:47EM: It goes up you know,
sort of a fairly straight way, and then it starts tailing off and you start getting diminishing returns. And you're like, uh oh, it was trending up and now
it's sort of, curving over and you start getting to these,
what I call local maxima, where you don't realize
basically how dumb you were. And then it happens again. 11:14And ultimately... These things, you know,
in retrospect, they seem obvious, but in order to solve
full self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI. Because what are the road networks
designed to work with? They're designed to work
with a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so in order to make it
work with computers, you basically need to solve
real-world AI and vision. Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed
for eyes and biological neural nets. 12:07You know, I guess
when you put it that way, it's sort of, like, quite obvious that the only way
to solve full self-driving is to solve real world AI
and sophisticated vision. 12:16CA: What do you feel
about the current architecture? Do you think you have an architecture now where there is a chance for the logarithmic curve
not to tail off any anytime soon? 12:27EM: Well I mean, admittedly
these may be infamous last words, but I actually am confident
that we will solve it this year. That we will exceed -- The probability of an accident, at what point do you exceed
that of the average person? I think we will exceed that this year. 12:47CA: What are you seeing behind the scenes
that gives you that confidence? 12:51EM: We’re almost at the point
where we have a high-quality unified vector space. In the beginning, we were trying
to do this with image recognition on individual images. But if you get one image out of a video, it's actually quite hard to see
what's going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment
of a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves. So the first thing we had to do
is tie all eight cameras together so they're synchronized, so that all the frames
are looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person, because we still need human labeling. So at least they’re not labeled
at different times by different people in different ways. So it's sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part
is to add the time dimension. So that you’re looking at surround video, and you're labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do
from a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto labeling, create auto labeling software to amplify
the efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label. In the beginning,
it was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. 14:16So basically what you have to have
is you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be
primarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors and making slight corrections
to the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections
into the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler
is able to take in vast amounts of video and with high accuracy, automatically label the video
for cars, lane lines, drive space. 14:46CA: What you’re saying is ... the result of this is that you're
effectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects
that are all around it. It knows what they are, and it knows how fast they are moving. And the remaining task is to predict what the quirky behaviors are
that, you know, that when a pedestrian is walking
down the road with a smaller pedestrian, that maybe that smaller pedestrian
might do something unpredictable or things like that. You have to build into it
before you can really call it safe. 15:24EM: You basically need to have
memory across time and space. So what I mean by that is ... Memory can’t be infinite, because it's using up a lot
of the computer's RAM basically. So you have to say how much
are you going to try to remember? It's very common
for things to be occluded. So if you talk about say,
a pedestrian walking past a truck where you saw the pedestrian start
on one side of the truck, then they're occluded by the truck. You would know intuitively, OK, that pedestrian is going to pop out
the other side, most likely. 16:07CA: A computer doesn't know it. 16:09EM: You need to slow down. 16:10CA: A skeptic is going to say
that every year for the last five years, you've kind of said, well, no this is the year, we're confident that it will be there
in a year or two or, you know, like it's always been about that far away. But we've got a new architecture now, you're seeing enough improvement
behind the scenes to make you not certain,
but pretty confident, that, by the end of this year, what in most, not in every city,
and every circumstance but in many cities and circumstances, basically the car will be able
to drive without interventions safer than a human. 16:43footnotefootnoteEM: Yes. I mean, the car currently
drives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions. So it's not like ... And we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program. So you can look at the videos
that they post online. 17:02CA: I do. And some of them are great,
and some of them are a little terrifying. I mean, occasionally
the car seems to veer off and scare the hell out of people. 17:12EM: It’s still a beta. CA: But you’re behind the scenes,
looking at the data, you're seeing enough improvement to believe that a this-year
timeline is real. 17:23EM: Yes, that's what it seems like. I mean, we could be here
talking again in a year, like, well, another year went by,
and it didn’t happen. But I think this is the year. 17:33CA: And so in general,
when people talk about Elon time, I mean it sounds like
you can't just have a general rule that if you predict that something
will be done in six months, actually what we should imagine
is it’s going to be a year or it’s like two-x or three-x,
it depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess,
things involving software, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder
to predict than others. 17:56Is there an element that you actually deliberately make
aggressive prediction timelines to drive people to be ambitious? Without that, nothing gets done? 18:06EM: Well, I generally believe,
in terms of internal timelines, that we want to set the most aggressive
timeline that we can. Because there’s sort of like
a law of gaseous expansion where, for schedules, where
whatever time you set, it's not going to be less than that. It's very rare
that it'll be less than that. But as far as our predictions
are concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report
all the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing
an article about me -- I've had a long career
in multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound
like the worst person on Earth. But if you put those
against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense, you know? So essentially like,
the longer you do anything, the more mistakes
that you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I'm the worst
predictor ever. But for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said I think we’d do 50 percent,
and we’ve done 80 percent. 19:08CA: Yes. 19:10EM: But they don't mention that one. So, I mean, I'm not sure what my exact
track record is on predictions. They're more optimistic than pessimistic,
but they're not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded
probably more or later, but they do come true. It's very rare that they do not come true. It's sort of like, you know, if there's some radical
technology prediction, the point is not
that it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That's the more important part. 19:45CA: So it feels like
at some point in the last year, seeing the progress on understanding, the Tesla AI understanding
the world around it, led to a kind of, an aha moment at Tesla. Because you really surprised people
recently when you said probably the most important
product development going on at Tesla this year
is this robot, Optimus. 20:10EM: Yes. 20:11CA: Many companies out there
have tried to put out these robots, they've been working on them for years. And so far no one has really cracked it. There's no mass adoption
robot in people's homes. There are some in manufacturing,
but I would say, no one's kind of, really cracked it. Is it something that happened in the development of full self-driving
that gave you the confidence to say, ""You know what, we could do
something special here."" 20:37EM: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it took me a while
to sort of realize that in order to solve self-driving, you really needed to solve real-world AI. And at the point of which you solve
real-world AI for a car, which is really a robot on four wheels, you can then generalize that
to a robot on legs as well. The two hard parts I think -- like obviously companies
like Boston Dynamics have shown that it's possible
to make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. 21:06CA: Right. 21:08EM: You know, so from a sensors
and actuators standpoint, it's certainly been demonstrated by many that it's possible to make
a humanoid robot. The things that are currently missing
are enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world
and do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So the missing things are basically
real-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things
that Tesla is very good at. And so then we basically just need
to design the specialized actuators and sensors that are needed
for humanoid robot. People have no idea,
this is going to be bigger than the car. 21:50CA: So let's dig into exactly that. I mean, in one way, it's actually
an easier problem than full self-driving because instead of an object
going along at 60 miles an hour, which if it gets it wrong,
someone will die. This is an object that's engineered
to only go at what, three or four or five miles an hour. And so a mistake,
there aren't lives at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake. 22:12EM: So long as the AI doesn't take it over
and murder us in our sleep or something. 22:17CA: Right. 22:18(Laughter) 22:20So talk about -- I think the first applications
you've mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing, but eventually the vision is to have
these available for people at home. If you had a robot that really understood
the 3D architecture of your house and knew where every object
in that house was or was supposed to be, and could recognize all those objects, I mean, that’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? Like the kind of thing
that you could ask a robot to do would be what? Like, tidy up? 22:54EM: Yeah, absolutely. Make dinner, I guess, mow the lawn. 22:59CA: Take a cup of tea to grandma
and show her family pictures. 23:04EM: Exactly. Take care
of my grandmother and make sure -- 23:08CA: It could obviously recognize
everyone in the home. It could play catch with your kids. 23:13EM: Yes. I mean, obviously,
we need to be careful this doesn't become a dystopian situation. I think one of the things
that's going to be important is to have a localized
ROM chip on the robot that cannot be updated over the air. Where if you, for example, were to say,
“Stop, stop, stop,” if anyone said that, then the robot would stop,
you know, type of thing. And that's not updatable remotely. I think it's going to be important
to have safety features like that. 23:42CA: Yeah, that sounds wise. 23:43EM: And I do think there should be
a regulatory agency for AI. I've said that for many years. I don't love being regulated, but I think this is an important
thing for public safety. 23:52CA: Let's come back to that. But I don't think many people
have really sort of taken seriously the notion of, you know, a robot at home. I mean, at the start
of the computing revolution, Bill Gates said there's going to be
a computer in every home. And people at the time said, yeah,
whatever, who would even want that. Do you think there will be basically
like in, say, 2050 or whatever, like a robot in most homes,
is what there will be, and people will love them
and count on them? You’ll have your own butler basically. 24:22EM: Yeah, you'll have your sort of
buddy robot probably, yeah. 24:27CA: I mean, how much of a buddy? How many applications have you thought, you know, can you have
a romantic partner, a sex partner? EM: It's probably inevitable. I mean, I did promise the internet
that I’d make catgirls. We could make a robot catgirl. 24:42CA: Be careful what
you promise the internet. 24:44(Laughter) 24:47EM: So, yeah, I guess it'll be
whatever people want really, you know. 24:52CA: What sort of timeline
should we be thinking about of the first models
that are actually made and sold? 25:01EM: Well, you know, the first units
that we intend to make are for jobs that are dangerous,
boring, repetitive, and things that people don't want to do. And, you know, I think we’ll have like
an interesting prototype sometime this year. We might have something useful next year, but I think quite likely
within at least two years. And then we'll see
rapid growth year over year of the usefulness
of the humanoid robots and decrease in cost
and scaling up production. 25:29CA: Initially just selling to businesses, or when do you picture
you'll start selling them where you can buy your parents one
for Christmas or something? 25:39EM: I'd say in less than ten years. 25:41CA: Help me on the economics of this. So what do you picture the cost
of one of these being? 25:47EM: Well, I think the cost is actually
not going to be crazy high. Like less than a car. Initially, things will be expensive
because it'll be a new technology at low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car
is greater than that of a humanoid robot. So I would expect that it's going
to be less than a car, or at least equivalent to a cheap car. 26:07CA: So even if it starts at 50k,
within a few years, it’s down to 20k or lower or whatever. And maybe for home
they'll get much cheaper still. But think about the economics of this. If you can replace a $30,000, $40,000-a-year worker, which you have to pay every year, with a one-time payment of $25,000 for a robot that can work longer hours, a pretty rapid replacement
of certain types of jobs. How worried should
the world be about that? 26:39EM: I wouldn't worry about the sort of,
putting people out of a job thing. I think we're actually going to have,
and already do have, a massive shortage of labor. So I think we will have ... Not people out of work, but actually still a shortage
labor even in the future. 26:58But this really will be
a world of abundance. Any goods and services will be available
to anyone who wants them. It'll be so cheap to have goods
and services, it will be ridiculous. 27:12CA: I'm presuming it should be possible
to imagine a bunch of goods and services that can't profitably be made now
but could be made in that world, courtesy of legions of robots. 27:23EM: Yeah. It will be a world of abundance. The only scarcity
that will exist in the future is that which we decide to create
ourselves as humans. 27:32CA: OK. So AI is allowing us to imagine
a differently powered economy that will create this abundance. What are you most worried
about going wrong? 27:42EM: Well, like I said,
AI and robotics will bring out what might be termed the age of abundance. Other people have used this word, and that this is my prediction: it will be an age of abundance 
for everyone. But I guess there’s ... The dangers would be
the artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples
from a collective human will and goes in the direction
that for some reason we don't like. Whatever direction it might go. 28:20You know, that’s sort of
the idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple
collective human world to digital superintelligence. And also along the way solve a lot
of brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn't succeed
in the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal
of alleviating brain and spine damage. 28:48CA: So the spirit there is
that if we're going to make these AIs that are so vastly intelligent,
we ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have
those superpowers more directly. But that doesn't seem to avoid
the risk that those superpowers might ... turn ugly in unintended ways. 29:08EM: I think it's a risk, I agree. I'm not saying that I have
some certain answer to that risk. I’m just saying like maybe one of the things
that would be good for ensuring that the future
is one that we want is to more tightly couple the collective human world
to digital intelligence. 29:36The issue that we face here
is that we are already a cyborg, if you think about it. The computers are
an extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have,
like, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages
and social media, emails. And it's quite eerie actually, when someone dies but everything
online is still there. But you say like, what's the limitation? What is it that inhibits
a human-machine symbiosis? It's the data rate. When you communicate,
especially with a phone, you're moving your thumbs very slowly. So you're like moving
your two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second,
optimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating
at the gigabyte level and beyond. 30:26CA: Have you seen evidence
that the technology is actually working, that you've got a richer, sort of,
higher bandwidth connection, if you like, between like external
electronics and a brain than has been possible before? 30:38EM: Yeah. I mean, the fundamental principles
of reading neurons, sort of doing read-write on neurons
with tiny electrodes, have been demonstrated for decades. So it's not like the concept is new. The problem is that there is
no product that works well that you can go and buy. So it's all sort of, in research labs. And it's like some cords
sticking out of your head. And it's quite gruesome,
and it's really ... There's no good product
that actually does a good job and is high-bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy
and would want to buy. 31:29But the way to think
of the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit
or an Apple Watch. That's where we take out
sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what, in many ways really is very much like
a Fitbit, Apple Watch or some kind of smart watch thing. But with tiny, tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it's very important
to have very tiny wires so that when they’re implanted,
they don’t damage the brain. 32:10CA: How far are you from putting
these into humans? 32:14EM: Well, we have put in
our FDA application to aspirationally do the first
human implant this year. 32:23CA: The first uses will be
for neurological injuries of different kinds. But rolling the clock forward and imagining when people
are actually using these for their own enhancement, let's say, and for the enhancement of the world, how clear are you in your mind as to what it will feel like
to have one of these inside your head? 32:45EM: Well, I do want to emphasize
we're at an early stage. And so it really will be
many years before we have anything approximating
a high-bandwidth neural interface that allows for AI-human symbiosis. For many years, we will just be solving
brain injuries and spinal injuries. For probably a decade. This is not something
that will suddenly one day it will have this incredible
sort of whole brain interface. It's going to be, like I said, at least a decade of really
just solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. And really, I think you can solve
a very wide range of brain injuries, including severe depression,
morbid obesity, sleep, potentially schizophrenia, like, a lot of things that cause
great stress to people. Restoring memory in older people. 33:51CA: If you can pull that off,
that's the app I will sign up for. 33:56EM: Absolutely. 33:57CA: Please hurry. (Laughs) 33:59EM: I mean, the emails that we get
at Neuralink are heartbreaking. I mean, they'll send us
just tragic, you know, where someone was sort of,
in the prime of life and they had an accident on a motorcycle and someone who's 25, you know,
can't even feed themselves. And this is something we could fix. 34:24CA: But you have said that AI is one
of the things you're most worried about and that Neuralink may be one of the ways where we can keep abreast of it. 34:35EM: Yeah, there's the short-term thing, which I think is helpful on an individual
human level with injuries. And then the long-term thing is an attempt to address the civilizational risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence
closer together. 34:58I mean, if you think of how
the brain works today, there are really two layers to the brain. There's the limbic system and the cortex. You've got the kind of,
animal brain where -- it’s kind of like the fun part, really. 35:08CA: It's where most of Twitter
operates, by the way. 35:11EM: I think Tim Urban said, we’re like somebody, you know,
stuck a computer on a monkey. You know, so we're like,
if you gave a monkey a computer, that's our cortex. But we still have a lot
of monkey instincts. Which we then try to rationalize
as, no, it's not a monkey instinct. It’s something more important than that. But it's often just really
a monkey instinct. We're just monkeys with a computer
stuck in our brain. But even though the cortex
is sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, I've not yet met anyone
who wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They're quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their
phones and their computers, which are really the tertiary,
the third part of your intelligence. It's just that it's ... Like the bandwidth, the rate of communication
with that tertiary layer is slow. And it's just a very tiny straw
to this tertiary layer. And we want to make that tiny
straw a big highway. And I’m definitely not saying
that this is going to solve everything. Or this is you know,
it’s the only thing -- it’s something that might be helpful. And worst-case scenario, I think we solve
some important brain injury, spinal injury issues,
and that's still a great outcome. 36:38CA: Best-case scenario, we may discover new
human possibility, telepathy, you've spoken of, in a way,
a connection with a loved one, you know, full memory and much faster
thought processing maybe. All these things. It's very cool. 36:55If AI were to take down Earth,
we need a plan B. Let's shift our attention to space. We spoke last time at TED
about reusability, and you had just demonstrated that
spectacularly for the first time. Since then, you've gone on to build
this monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules
of the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship. 37:22EM: Starship is extremely fundamental. 37:24So the holy grail of rocketry
or space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come
is our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover
the first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60 percent
of the cost of the vehicle of the whole launch, maybe 70 percent. And we've now done that
over a hundred times. So with Starship, we will be
recovering the entire thing. Or at least that's the goal. 38:01CA: Right. 38:02EM: And moreover,
recovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need
to do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and
to the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal
is immediate re-flight. So you just refill
propellants and go again. And this is gigantic. Just as it would be
in any other mode of transport. 38:33CA: And the main design is to basically take
100 plus people at a time, plus a bunch of things
that they need, to Mars. So, first of all, talk about that piece. What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time,
a Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people,
but just equipment. Two, with people. Three, there’s sort of, OK, 100 people at a time, let's go. 39:04EM: Sure. And just to put the cost
thing into perspective, the expected cost of Starship, putting 100 tons into orbit, is significantly less
than what it would have cost or what it did cost to put our tiny
Falcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying
a 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane
that was thrown away. So it's really pretty mind-boggling
that the giant thing costs less, way less than the small thing. So it doesn't use exotic propellants or things that are difficult
to obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, and it's primarily oxygen,
roughly 77-78 percent oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere
and has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O,
so you can make CH4, methane, and O2, oxygen, on Mars. 40:12CA: Presumably, one of the first tasks
on Mars will be to create a fuel plant that can create the fuel
for the return trips of many Starships. 40:20EM: Yes. And actually, it's mostly
going to be oxygen plants, because it's 78 percent oxygen,
22 percent fuel. But the fuel is a simple fuel
that is easy to create on Mars. And in many other parts
of the solar system. So basically ... And it's all propulsive landing,
no parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable
of entering on Earth or Mars. We can even potentially go to Venus. but you don't want to go there. (Laughs) Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could ... It's a generalized method of transport
to anywhere in the solar system, because the point at which
you have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt and to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and ultimately anywhere
in the solar system. 41:19CA: But your main focus and SpaceX's main focus is still Mars. That is the mission. That is where most of the effort will go? Or are you actually imagining
a much broader array of uses even in the coming, you know, the first decade or so of uses of this. Where we could go,
for example, to other places in the solar system to explore, perhaps NASA wants to use
the rocket for that reason. 41:53EM: Yeah, NASA is planning to use
a Starship to return to the moon, to return people to the moon. And so we're very honored that NASA
has chosen us to do this. But I'm saying it is a generalized -- it’s a general solution to getting anywhere
in the greater solar system. It's not suitable for going
to another star system, but it is a general solution for transport
anywhere in the solar system. 42:25CA: Before it can do any of that, it's got to demonstrate it can get into
orbit, you know, around Earth. What’s your latest advice
on the timeline for that? 42:35EM: It's looking promising for us
to have an orbital launch attempt in a few months. So we're actually integrating -- will be integrating the engines
into the booster for the first orbital flight
starting in about a week or two. And the launch complex
itself is ready to go. So assuming we get regulatory approval, I think we could have an orbital
launch attempt within a few months. 43:10CA: And a radical new technology like this presumably there is real risk
on those early attempts. 43:15EM: Oh, 100 percent, yeah. The joke I make all the time
is that excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed,
but excitement certainly is. 43:23CA: But the last I saw on your timeline, you've slightly put back the expected date to put the first human on Mars
till 2029, I want to say? 43:33EM: Yeah, I mean, so let's see. I mean, we have built a production
system for Starship, so we're making a lot
of ships and boosters. 43:43CA: How many are you planning
to make actually? 43:46EM: Well, we're currently expecting
to make a booster and a ship roughly every, well, initially,
roughly every couple of months, and then hopefully by the end
of this year, one every month. So it's giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms
of rough orders of magnitude, in order to create
a self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something
on the order of a thousand ships. And we just need a Helen of Sparta,
I guess, on Mars. 44:19CA: This is not in most
people's heads, Elon. 44:21EM: The planet that launched 1,000 ships. 44:24CA: That's nice. But this is not in most people's heads, this picture that you have in your mind. There's basically a two-year window, you can only really fly to Mars
conveniently every two years. You were picturing that during the 2030s, every couple of years, something like 1,000 Starships take off, each containing 100 or more people. That picture is just completely
mind-blowing to me. That sense of this armada
of humans going to -- 44:54EM: It'll be like ""Battlestar
Galactica,"" the fleet departs. 44:57CA: And you think that it can
basically be funded by people spending maybe a couple hundred grand
on a ticket to Mars? Is that price about where it has been? 45:07EM: Well, I think if you say like, what's required in order to get
enough people and enough cargo to Mars to build a self-sustaining city. And it's where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go, because I think only a small percentage
of humanity will want to go, and can afford to go
or get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people
or something like that. And so it’s what can a million people
afford, or get sponsorship for, because I think governments
will also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point
at which you say, OK, like, if moving to Mars costs are,
for argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think you know,
almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000
and be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available
to anyone who wants to go. 46:10It's very important to emphasize
that Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped,
difficult, hard work. It's kind of like that Shackleton ad
for going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real,
but it sounds real and it's cool. It's sort of like, the sales pitch
for going to Mars is, ""It's dangerous, it's cramped. You might not make it back. It's difficult, it's hard work."" That's the sales pitch. 46:41CA: Right. But you will make history. 46:44EM: But it'll be glorious. 46:47CA: So on that kind of launch rate
you're talking about over two decades, you could get your million people
to Mars, essentially. 46:54Whose city is it? Is it NASA's city, is it SpaceX's city? 46:57EM: It’s the people of Mars’ city. The reason for this, I mean,
I feel like why do this thing? I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity
or consciousness. Human civilization could come
to an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor or super volcanoes
or extreme climate change. Or World War III, or you know,
any one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span
of civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view
as this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That is what appears to be the case. We're in this vast darkness of space, and there's this little
candle of consciousness that’s only really come about
after 4.5 billion years, and it could just go out. 48:01CA: I think that's powerful, and I think a lot of people
will be inspired by that vision. And the reason you need the million people is because there has to be
enough people there to do everything that you need to survive. 48:13EM: Really, like the critical threshold
is if the ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, does the Mars City die out or not? And so we have to -- You know, people talk about like,
the sort of, the great filters, the things that perhaps, you know, we talk about the Fermi paradox,
and where are the aliens? Well maybe there are these
various great filters that the aliens didn’t pass, and so they eventually
just ceased to exist. And one of the great filters
is becoming a multi-planet species. So we want to pass that filter. And I'll be long-dead before
this is, you know, a real thing, before it happens. But I’d like to at least see us make
great progress in this direction. 49:07CA: Given how tortured
the Earth is right now, how much we're beating each other up, shouldn't there be discussions going on with everyone who is dreaming
about Mars to try to say, we've got a once
in a civilization's chance to make some new rules here? Should someone be trying
to lead those discussions to figure out what it means for this
to be the people of Mars' City? 49:35EM: Well, I think ultimately this will be up to the people
of Mars to decide how they want to rethink society. Yeah there’s certainly risk there. And hopefully the people of Mars
will be more enlightened and will not fight
amongst each other too much. I mean, I have some recommendations, which people of Mars
may choose to listen to or not. I would advocate for more
of a direct democracy, not a representative democracy, and laws that are short enough
for people to understand. Where it is harder to create laws
than to get rid of them. 50:14CA: Coming back a bit nearer term, I'd love you to just talk a bit
about some of the other possibility space that Starship seems to have created. So given -- Suddenly we've got this ability
to move 100 tons-plus into orbit. So we've just launched
the James Webb telescope, which is an incredible thing. It's unbelievable. 50:35EM: Exquisite piece of technology. 50:37CA: Exquisite piece of technology. But people spent two years trying
to figure out how to fold up this thing. It's a three-ton telescope. 50:44EM: We can make it a lot easier
if you’ve got more volume and mass. 50:47CA: But let's ask a different question. Which is, how much more powerful
a telescope could someone design based on using Starship, for example? 50:59EM: I mean, roughly, I'd say it's probably
an order of magnitude more resolution. If you've got 100 tons
and a thousand cubic meters volume, which is roughly what we have. 51:08CA: And what about other exploration
through the solar system? I mean, I'm you know -- 51:14EM: Europa is a big question mark. 51:17CA: Right, so there's an ocean there. And what you really want to do
is to drop a submarine into that ocean. 51:22EM: Maybe there's like,
some squid civilization, cephalopod civilization
under the ice of Europa. That would be pretty interesting. 51:29CA: I mean, Elon, if you could take
a submarine to Europa and we see pictures of this thing
being devoured by a squid, that would honestly be
the happiest moment of my life. 51:38EM: Pretty wild, yeah. 51:40CA: What other possibilities
are out there? Like, it feels like if you're going to
create a thousand of these things, they can only fly to Mars every two years. What are they doing the rest of the time? It feels like there's this
explosion of possibility that I don't think people
are really thinking about. 52:00EM: I don't know, we've certainly
got a long way to go. As you alluded to earlier,
we still have to get to orbit. And then after we get to orbit, we have to really prove out and refine
full and rapid reusability. That'll take a moment. But I do think we will solve this. I'm highly confident
we will solve this at this point. 52:26CA: Do you ever wake up with the fear that there's going to be this
Hindenburg moment for SpaceX where ... 52:31EM: We've had many Hindenburg. Well, we've never had Hindenburg moments
with people, which is very important. Big difference. We've blown up quite a few rockets. So there's a whole compilation online
that we put together and others put together, it's showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy
going through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out
of Earth's gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity
and a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40 percent, it's like, 37 percent of Earth's gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars
to the surface of Earth. Whereas getting to Mars requires
a giant booster and orbital refilling. 53:17CA: So, Elon, as I think more
about this incredible array of things that you're involved with, I keep seeing these synergies, to use a horrible word, between them. You know, for example, the robots you're building from Tesla
could possibly be pretty handy on Mars, doing some of the dangerous
work and so forth. I mean, maybe there's a scenario
where your city on Mars doesn't need a million people, it needs half a million people
and half a million robots. And that's a possibility. Maybe The Boring Company could play a role helping create some of the subterranean
dwelling spaces that you might need. 53:57EM: Yeah. 53:58CA: Back on planet Earth, it seems like a partnership
between Boring Company and Tesla could offer an unbelievable deal to a city to say, we will create for you
a 3D network of tunnels populated by robo-taxis that will offer fast, low-cost
transport to anyone. You know, full self-driving may
or may not be done this year. And in some cities,
like, somewhere like Mumbai, I suspect won't be done for a decade. 54:26EM: Some places are more
challenging than others. 54:28CA: But today, today,
with what you've got, you could put a 3D network
of tunnels under there. 54:35EM: Oh, if it’s just in a tunnel,
that’s a solved problem. 54:38CA: Exactly, full self-driving
is a solved problem. To me, there’s amazing synergy there. With Starship, you know, Gwynne Shotwell talked
about by 2028 having from city to city, you know, transport on planet Earth. 54:52EM: This is a real possibility. The fastest way to get
from one place to another, if it's a long distance, is a rocket. It's basically an ICBM. 55:05CA: But it has to land -- Because it's an ICBM,
it has to land probably offshore, because it's loud. So why not have a tunnel
that then connects to the city with Tesla? And Neuralink. I mean, if you going to go to Mars having a telepathic connection
with loved ones back home, even if there's a time delay... 55:29EM: These are not intended
to be connected, by the way. But there certainly could be
some synergies, yeah. 55:35CA: Surely there is a growing argument that you should actually put
all these things together into one company and just have a company
devoted to creating a future that’s exciting, and let a thousand flowers bloom. Have you been thinking about that? 55:53EM: I mean, it is tricky because Tesla
is a publicly-traded company, and the investor base of Tesla and SpaceX and certainly Boring Company
and Neuralink are quite different. Boring Company and Neuralink
are tiny companies. 56:08CA: By comparison. 56:10EM: Yeah, Tesla's got 110,000 people. SpaceX I think is around 12,000 people. Boring Company and Neuralink
are both under 200 people. So they're little, tiny companies, but they will probably
get bigger in the future. They will get bigger in the future. It's not that easy to sort
of combine these things. 56:33CA: Traditionally, you have said
that for SpaceX especially, you wouldn't want it public, because public investors wouldn't support
the craziness of the idea of going to Mars or whatever. 56:43EM: Yeah, making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon
of Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least. 56:54CA: I think something's changed, though. What's changed is that Tesla is now
so powerful and so big and throws off so much cash that you actually could
connect the dots here. Just tell the public that x-billion
dollars a year, whatever your number is, will be diverted to the Mars mission. I suspect you'd have massive
interest in that company. And it might unlock a lot
more possibility for you, no? 57:22EM: I would like to give the public access
to ownership of SpaceX, but I mean the thing that like, the overhead associated
with a public company is high. I mean, as a public company,
you're just constantly sued. It does occupy like, a fair bit of ... You know, time and effort
to deal with these things. 57:49CA: But you would still only have one
public company, it would be bigger, and have more things going on. But instead of being
on four boards, you'd be on one. 57:57EM: I'm actually not even on the Neuralink
or Boring Company boards. And I don't really attend
the SpaceX board meetings. We only have two a year, and I just stop by and chat for an hour. The board overhead for a public
company is much higher. 58:15CA: I think some investors probably worry
about how your time is being split, and they might be excited
by you know, that. Anyway, I just woke up the other day thinking, just, there are so many ways
in which these things connect. And you know,
just the simplicity of that mission, of building a future that is worth
getting excited about, might appeal to an awful lot of people. 58:41Elon, you are reported by Forbes
and everyone else as now, you know, the world's richest person. 58:48EM: That’s not a sovereign. 58:49CA: (Laughs) EM: You know, I think it’s fair to say that if somebody is like, the king
or de facto king of a country, they're wealthier than I am. 58:59CA: But it’s just harder to measure -- So $300 billion. I mean, your net worth on any given day is rising or falling
by several billion dollars. How insane is that? 59:12EM: It's bonkers, yeah. 59:14CA: I mean, how do you handle
that psychologically? There aren't many people in the world
who have to even think about that. 59:20EM: I actually don't think
about that too much. But the thing that is
actually more difficult and that does make sleeping difficult is that, you know, every good hour or even minute of thinking about Tesla and SpaceX has such a big effect on the company that I really try to work
as much as possible, you know, to the edge
of sanity, basically. Because you know,
Tesla’s getting to the point where probably will get
to the point later this year, where every high-quality
minute of thinking is a million dollars impact on Tesla. Which is insane. I mean, the basic, you know,
if Tesla is doing, you know, sort of $2 billion a week,
let’s say, in revenue, it’s sort of $300 million a day,
seven days a week. You know, it's ... 1:00:28CA: If you can change that by five percent
in an hour’s brainstorm, that's a pretty valuable hour. 1:00:37EM: I mean, there are many instances
where a half-hour meeting, I was able to improve
the financial outcome of the company by $100 million
in a half-hour meeting. 1:00:50CA: There are many other people out there who can't stand
this world of billionaires. Like, they are hugely
offended by the notion that an individual can have
the same wealth as, say, a billion or more
of the world's poorest people. 1:01:07EM: If they examine sort of -- I think there's some axiomatic flaws
that are leading them to that conclusion. For sure, it would be very
problematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year
in personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don't even own
a home right now. I'm literally staying at friends' places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most
of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through
friends' spare bedrooms. I don't have a yacht,
I really don't take vacations. It’s not as though my personal
consumption is high. I mean, the one exception is a plane. But if I don't use the plane,
then I have less hours to work. 1:01:55CA: I mean, I personally think
you have shown that you are mostly driven by really quite a deep
sense of moral purpose. Like, your attempts to solve
the climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else
on the planet that I'm aware of. And I actually can't understand, personally, I can't understand the fact that you get all this criticism
from the Left about, ""Oh, my God, he's so rich,
that's disgusting."" When climate is their issue. Philanthropy is a topic
that some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that? 1:02:31EM: I think if you care
about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it,
philanthropy is extremely difficult. SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink
and The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy
is love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love -- philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure
the long-term survival of humanity with a multiple-planet species. That is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is trying to help
solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic,
which is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity. 1:03:20CA: How upsetting is it to you to hear this constant drumbeat of, ""Billionaires, my God,
Elon Musk, oh, my God?"" Like, do you just shrug that off or does it does it actually hurt? 1:03:36EM: I mean, at this point,
it's water off a duck's back. 1:03:39CA: Elon, I’d like to,
as we wrap up now, just pull the camera back
and just think ... You’re a father now
of seven surviving kids. 1:03:49EM: Well, I mean, I'm trying
to set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we're facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns
to a sustainable level. 1:04:01CA: Yeah, you've talked about this a lot, that depopulation is a big problem, and people don't understand
how big a problem it is. 1:04:08EM: Population collapse
is one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization. And that is what is going on right now. 1:04:14CA: What drives you on a day-to-day
basis to do what you do? 1:04:17EM: I guess, like,
I really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we're on a path to understanding
the nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand
the nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope
and scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out. Or we certainly won’t understand this. I would say I’ve been motivated
by curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know? 1:05:03CA: And are you? Are you not sad? 1:05:06EM: I'm sometimes sad, but mostly I'm feeling I guess relatively optimistic
about the future these days. There are certainly some big
risks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse
is a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below
what's needed to sustain civilization at its current level. And there's obviously ... We need to take action
on climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure
the future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species. We need to address -- Essentially, it's important to take
whatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks
that affect the future of consciousness. 1:06:00CA: There's a whole
generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them? 1:06:07EM: Well, I think if you want the future
to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be. 1:06:17CA: Elon, thank you for all this time. That is a beautiful place to end. Thanks for all you're doing. 1:06:22EM: You're welcome."

It's because our attention is pulled
in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive
if you can stay focused. 00:16Many people think that attention
is all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information
our brain is trying to filter out. 00:26There are two ways
you direct your attention. First, there's overt attention. In overt attention,
you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. Then there's covert attention. In covert attention,
you pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes. Think of driving for a second. Your overt attention,
your direction of the eyes, are in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning
the surrounding area, where you don't actually look at them. 01:05I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work on cognitive
brain-machine interfaces, or bringing together
the brain and the computer. I love brain patterns. Brain patterns are important for us because based on them
we can build models for the computers, and based on these models computers can recognize
how well our brain functions. And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves
can be used as assistive devices for therapies. But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. Right? In case of attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking -- that makes covert attention
an interesting model for computers. 02:02So I wanted to know
what are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly
or when you look covertly. I set up an experiment for that. In this experiment
there are two flickering squares, one of them flickering
at a slower rate than the other one. Depending on which of these flickers
you are paying attention to, certain parts of your brain
will start resonating in the same rate as that flickering rate. So by analyzing your brain signals, we can track where exactly
you are watching or you are paying attention to. 02:43So to see what happens in your brain
when you pay overt attention, I asked people to look directly
in one of the squares and pay attention to it. In this case, not surprisingly,
we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming
from the back of their head, which is responsible for the processing
of your visual information. But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain
when you pay covert attention. So this time I asked people
to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes, to pay attention
to either of these squares. When we did that, we saw that both of these flickering rates
appeared in their brain signals, but interestingly, only one of them,
which was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically
the activation of the frontal area. The front part of your brain
is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human. The frontal part,
it seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in
only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the information
coming from the ignored one. 04:15The filtering ability of the brain
is indeed a key for attention, which is missing in some people, for example in people with ADHD. So a person with ADHD
cannot inhibit these distractors, and that's why they can't focus
for a long time on a single task. But what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer, and then train his own brain to inhibit these distractors? 04:53Well, ADHD is just one example. We can use these cognitive
brain-machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields. It was just a few years ago that my grandfather had a stroke,
and he lost complete ability to speak. He could understand everybody,
but there was no way to respond, even not writing
because he was illiterate. So he passed away in silence. I remember thinking at that time: What if we could have a computer which could speak for him? Now, after years that I am in this field, I can see that this might be possible. Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think
about images or even letters, like the letter A generates
a different brainwave pattern than the letter B, and so on. Could a computer one day
communicate for people who can't speak? What if a computer can help us understand
the thoughts of a person in a coma? We are not there yet, but pay close attention. We will be there soon. 06:11Thank you. 06:13(Applause)"

far beyond your natural senses. Let's start with cognitive augmentation. How many of you are augmented cyborgs? 01:24(Laughter) 01:26I would actually argue
that we're already augmented. Imagine you're at a party, and somebody asks you a question
that you don't know the answer to. If you have one of these,
in a few seconds, you can know the answer. But this is just a primitive beginning. Even Siri is just a passive tool. In fact, for the last
three-and-a-half million years, the tools that we've had
have been completely passive. They do exactly what we tell them
and nothing more. Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it. The chisel only carves
where the artist points it. And even our most advanced tools
do nothing without our explicit direction. In fact, to date, and this
is something that frustrates me, we've always been limited by this need to manually
push our wills into our tools -- like, manual,
literally using our hands, even with computers. But I'm more like Scotty in ""Star Trek."" 02:26(Laughter) 02:28I want to have a conversation
with a computer. I want to say, ""Computer,
let's design a car,"" and the computer shows me a car. And I say, ""No, more fast-looking,
and less German,"" and bang, the computer shows me an option. 02:39(Laughter) 02:42That conversation might be
a little ways off, probably less than many of us think, but right now, we're working on it. Tools are making this leap
from being passive to being generative. Generative design tools
use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs
all by themselves. All it needs are your goals
and your constraints. 03:06I'll give you an example. In the case of this aerial drone chassis, all you would need to do
is tell it something like, it has four propellers, you want it to be
as lightweight as possible, and you need it to be
aerodynamically efficient. Then what the computer does
is it explores the entire solution space: every single possibility that solves
and meets your criteria -- millions of them. It takes big computers to do this. But it comes back to us with designs that we, by ourselves,
never could've imagined. And the computer's coming up
with this stuff all by itself -- no one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch. And by the way, it's no accident that the drone body looks just like
the pelvis of a flying squirrel. 03:51(Laughter) 03:54It's because the algorithms
are designed to work the same way evolution does. 03:58What's exciting is we're starting
to see this technology out in the real world. We've been working with Airbus
for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future. It's a ways out still. But just recently we used
a generative-design AI to come up with this. This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
that's been designed by a computer. It's stronger than the original
yet half the weight, and it will be flying
in the Airbus A320 later this year. So computers can now generate; they can come up with their own solutions
to our well-defined problems. But they're not intuitive. They still have to start from scratch
every single time, and that's because they never learn. Unlike Maggie. 04:44(Laughter) 04:45Maggie's actually smarter
than our most advanced design tools. What do I mean by that? If her owner picks up that leash, Maggie knows with a fair
degree of certainty it's time to go for a walk. And how did she learn? Well, every time the owner picked up
the leash, they went for a walk. And Maggie did three things: she had to pay attention, she had to remember what happened and she had to retain and create
a pattern in her mind. 05:11Interestingly, that's exactly what computer scientists
have been trying to get AIs to do for the last 60 or so years. Back in 1952, they built this computer
that could play Tic-Tac-Toe. Big deal. Then 45 years later, in 1997, Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess. 2011, Watson beats these two
humans at Jeopardy, which is much harder for a computer
to play than chess is. In fact, rather than working
from predefined recipes, Watson had to use reasoning
to overcome his human opponents. And then a couple of weeks ago, DeepMind's AlphaGo beats
the world's best human at Go, which is the most difficult
game that we have. In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves than there are atoms in the universe. So in order to win, what AlphaGo had to do
was develop intuition. And in fact, at some points,
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing. 06:19And things are moving really fast. I mean, consider --
in the space of a human lifetime, computers have gone from a child's game to what's recognized as the pinnacle
of strategic thought. What's basically happening is computers are going
from being like Spock to being a lot more like Kirk. 06:39(Laughter) 06:43Right? From pure logic to intuition. Would you cross this bridge? Most of you are saying, ""Oh, hell no!"" 06:52(Laughter) 06:54And you arrived at that decision
in a split second. You just sort of knew
that bridge was unsafe. And that's exactly the kind of intuition that our deep-learning systems
are starting to develop right now. Very soon, you'll literally be able to show something you've made,
you've designed, to a computer, and it will look at it and say, ""Sorry, homie, that'll never work.
You have to try again."" Or you could ask it if people
are going to like your next song, or your next flavor of ice cream. Or, much more importantly, you could work with a computer
to solve a problem that we've never faced before. For instance, climate change. We're not doing a very
good job on our own, we could certainly use
all the help we can get. That's what I'm talking about, technology amplifying
our cognitive abilities so we can imagine and design things
that were simply out of our reach as plain old un-augmented humans. 07:47So what about making
all of this crazy new stuff that we're going to invent and design? I think the era of human augmentation
is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual,
intellectual realm. How will technology augment us? In the physical world, robotic systems. OK, there's certainly a fear that robots are going to take
jobs away from humans, and that is true in certain sectors. But I'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together
are going to augment each other, and start to inhabit a new space. 08:24This is our applied research lab
in San Francisco, where one of our areas of focus
is advanced robotics, specifically, human-robot collaboration. And this is Bishop, one of our robots. As an experiment, we set it up to help a person working in construction
doing repetitive tasks -- tasks like cutting out holes for outlets
or light switches in drywall. 08:46(Laughter) 08:49So, Bishop's human partner
can tell what to do in plain English and with simple gestures, kind of like talking to a dog, and then Bishop executes
on those instructions with perfect precision. We're using the human
for what the human is good at: awareness, perception and decision making. And we're using the robot
for what it's good at: precision and repetitiveness. 09:10Here's another cool project
that Bishop worked on. The goal of this project,
which we called the HIVE, was to prototype the experience
of humans, computers and robots all working together to solve
a highly complex design problem. The humans acted as labor. They cruised around the construction site,
they manipulated the bamboo -- which, by the way,
because it's a non-isomorphic material, is super hard for robots to deal with. But then the robots
did this fiber winding, which was almost impossible
for a human to do. And then we had an AI
that was controlling everything. It was telling the humans what to do,
telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands
of individual components. What's interesting is, building this pavilion
was simply not possible without human, robot and AI
augmenting each other. 09:57OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy. We're working with Amsterdam-based artist
Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D to generatively design
and robotically print the world's first autonomously
manufactured bridge. So, Joris and an AI are designing
this thing right now, as we speak, in Amsterdam. And when they're done,
we're going to hit ""Go,"" and robots will start 3D printing
in stainless steel, and then they're going to keep printing,
without human intervention, until the bridge is finished. 10:29So, as computers are going
to augment our ability to imagine and design new stuff, robotic systems are going to help us
build and make things that we've never been able to make before. But what about our ability
to sense and control these things? What about a nervous system
for the things that we make? 10:48Our nervous system,
the human nervous system, tells us everything
that's going on around us. But the nervous system of the things
we make is rudimentary at best. For instance, a car doesn't tell
the city's public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner
of Broadway and Morrison. A building doesn't tell its designers whether or not the people inside
like being there, and the toy manufacturer doesn't know if a toy is actually being played with -- how and where and whether
or not it's any fun. Look, I'm sure that the designers
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie when they designed her. 11:22(Laughter) 11:24But what if it turns out that Barbie's
actually really lonely? 11:27(Laughter) 11:31If the designers had known what was really happening
in the real world with their designs -- the road,
the building, Barbie -- they could've used that knowledge
to create an experience that was better for the user. What's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things
that we design, make and use. What if all of you had that kind
of information flowing to you from the things you create
in the real world? With all of the stuff we make, we spend a tremendous amount
of money and energy -- in fact, last year,
about two trillion dollars -- convincing people to buy
the things we've made. But if you had this connection
to the things that you design and create after they're out in the real world, after they've been sold
or launched or whatever, we could actually change that, and go from making people want our stuff, to just making stuff that people
want in the first place. 12:21The good news is, we're working
on digital nervous systems that connect us to the things we design. We're working on one project with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles
called the Bandito Brothers and their team. And one of the things these guys do
is build insane cars that do absolutely insane things. These guys are crazy -- 12:44(Laughter) 12:45in the best way. And what we're doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system. 12:54So we instrumented it
with dozens of sensors, put a world-class driver behind the wheel, took it out to the desert
and drove the hell out of it for a week. And the car's nervous system
captured everything that was happening to the car. We captured four billion data points; all of the forces
that it was subjected to. And then we did something crazy. We took all of that data, and plugged it into a generative-design AI
we call ""Dreamcatcher."" So what do get when you give
a design tool a nervous system, and you ask it to build you
the ultimate car chassis? You get this. This is something that a human
could never have designed. Except a human did design this, but it was a human that was augmented
by a generative-design AI, a digital nervous system and robots that can actually
fabricate something like this. 13:47So if this is the future,
the Augmented Age, and we're going to be augmented
cognitively, physically and perceptually, what will that look like? What is this wonderland going to be like? 14:00I think we're going to see a world where we're moving
from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed. Where we're moving from things
that are constructed to that which is grown. We're going to move from being isolated to being connected. And we'll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation. I also think we'll shift
from craving obedience from our things to valuing autonomy. 14:30Thanks to our augmented capabilities, our world is going to change dramatically. We're going to have a world
with more variety, more connectedness, more dynamism, more complexity, more adaptability and, of course, more beauty. The shape of things to come will be unlike anything
we've ever seen before. Why? Because what will be shaping those things
is this new partnership between technology, nature and humanity. That, to me, is a future
well worth looking forward to. 15:03Thank you all so much. 15:04(Applause)"
1,How do we find dignity at work?,Roy Bahat and Bryn Freedman,Feb 2019,"Roy Bahat was worried. His company invests in new technology like AI to make businesses more efficient -- but, he wondered, what was AI doing to the people whose jobs might change, go away or become less fulfilling?

funds these AI programs and invests. So why should we trust you
to not have a bias and tell us something really useful
for the rest of us about the future of work? 00:17Roy Bahat: Yes, I am. And when you wake up in the morning
and you read the newspaper and it says, ""The robots are coming,
they may take all our jobs,"" as a start-up investor
focused on the future of work, our fund was the first one to say artificial intelligence
should be a focus for us. 00:32So I woke up one morning
and read that and said, ""Oh, my gosh, they're talking about me.
That's me who's doing that."" And then I thought: wait a minute. If things continue, then maybe not only will the start-ups
in which we invest struggle because there won't be people to have jobs to pay for the things
that they make and buy them, but our economy and society
might struggle, too. 00:57And look, I should be the guy
who sits here and tells you, ""Everything is going to be fine.
It's all going to work out great. Hey, when they introduced the ATM machine, years later, there's more
tellers in banks."" It's true. And yet, when I looked at it, I thought,
""This is going to accelerate. And if it does accelerate,
there's a chance the center doesn't hold."" But I figured somebody must know
the answer to this; there are so many ideas out there. And I read all the books,
and I went to the conferences, and at one point, we counted more than
100 efforts to study the future of work. And it was a frustrating experience, because I'd hear the same back-and-forth
over and over again: ""The robots are coming!"" And then somebody else would say, ""Oh, don't worry about that, they've
always said that and it turns out OK."" Then somebody else would say, ""Well, it's really about the meaning
of your job, anyway."" And then everybody would shrug
and go off and have a drink. And it felt like there was this
Kabuki theater of this discussion, where nobody was talking to each other. 01:54And many of the people that I knew
and worked with in the technology world were not speaking to policy makers; the policy makers
were not speaking to them. And so we partnered with a nonpartisan
think tank NGO called New America to study this issue. And we brought together a group of people, including an AI czar
at a technology company and a video game designer and a heartland conservative and a Wall Street investor and a socialist magazine editor -- literally, all in the same room;
it was occasionally awkward -- to try to figure out
what is it that will happen here. 02:25The question we asked was simple. It was: What is the effect of technology
on work going to be? And we looked out 10 to 20 years, because we wanted to look out far enough
that there could be real change, but soon enough that we weren't talking
about teleportation or anything like that. And we recognized -- and I think every year
we're reminded of this in the world -- that predicting what's
going to happen is hard. So instead of predicting,
there are other things you can do. You can try to imagine
alternate possible futures, which is what we did. We did a scenario-planning exercise, and we imagined cases
where no job is safe. We imagined cases where every job is safe. And we imagined every
distinct possibility we could. 03:06And the result, which really surprised us, was when you think through those futures
and you think what should we do, the answers about what we should do
actually turn out to be the same, no matter what happens. And the irony of looking out
10 to 20 years into the future is, you realize that the things
we want to act on are actually already happening right now. The automation is right now,
the future is right now. 03:30BF: So what does that mean,
and what does that tell us? If the future is now, what is it
that we should be doing, and what should we be thinking about? 03:37RB: We have to understand
the problem first. And so the data are that as the economy
becomes more productive and individual workers
become more productive, their wages haven't risen. If you look at the proportion
of prime working-age men, in the United States at least, who work now versus in 1960, we have three times
as many men not working. And then you hear the stories. 03:59I sat down with a group
of Walmart workers and said, ""What do you think about this cashier,
this futuristic self-checkout thing?"" They said, ""That's nice, but have
you heard about the cash recycler? That's a machine that's being
installed right now, and is eliminating two jobs
at every Walmart right now."" And so we just thought, ""Geez. We don't
understand the problem."" And so we looked at the voices
that were the ones that were excluded, which is all of the people
affected by this change. And we decided to listen to them, sort of ""automation and its discontents."" 04:26And I've spent the last
couple of years doing that. I've been to Flint, Michigan,
and Youngstown, Ohio, talking about entrepreneurs,
trying to make it work in a very different environment
from New York or San Francisco or London or Tokyo. I've been to prisons twice to talk to inmates about
their jobs after they leave. I've sat down with truck drivers
to ask them about the self-driving truck, with people who, in addition
to their full-time job, care for an aging relative. And when you talk to people, there were two themes
that came out loud and clear. 04:56The first one was that people
are less looking for more money or get out of the fear
of the robot taking their job, and they just want something stable. They want something predictable. So if you survey people and ask them
what they want out of work, for everybody who makes
less than 150,000 dollars a year, they'll take a more stable
and secure income, on average, over earning more money. And if you think about the fact that not only for all of the people
across the earth who don't earn a living, but for those who do, the vast majority earn a different
amount from month to month and have an instability, all of a sudden you realize, ""Wait a minute. We have
a real problem on our hands."" 05:35And the second thing they say,
which took us a longer time to understand, is they say they want dignity. And that concept
of self-worth through work emerged again and again and again
in our conversations. 05:49BF: So, I certainly
appreciate this answer. But you can't eat dignity, you can't clothe your children
with self-esteem. So, what is that, how do you reconcile -- what does dignity mean, and what is the relationship
between dignity and stability? 06:06RB: You can't eat dignity.
You need stability first. And the good news is, many of the conversations
that are happening right now are about how we solve that. You know, I'm a proponent
of studying guaranteed income, as one example, conversations about how
health care gets provided and other benefits. Those conversations are happening, and we're at a time
where we must figure that out. It is the crisis of our era. 06:28And my point of view
after talking to people is that we may do that, and it still might not be enough. Because what we need to do
from the beginning is understand what is it about work
that gives people dignity, so they can live the lives
that they want to live. And so that concept of dignity is ... it's difficult to get your hands around, because when many people hear it --
especially, to be honest, rich people -- they hear ""meaning."" They hear ""My work is important to me."" And again, if you survey people
and you ask them, ""How important is it to you
that your work be important to you?"" only people who make
150,000 dollars a year or more say that it is important to them
that their work be important. 07:12BF: Meaning, meaningful? 07:13RB: Just defined as,
""Is your work important to you?"" Whatever somebody took that to mean. And yet, of course dignity is essential. We talked to truck drivers who said, ""I saw my cousin drive, and I got
on the open road and it was amazing. And I started making more money
than people who went to college."" Then they'd get to the end
of their thought and say something like, ""People need their fruits
and vegetables in the morning, and I'm the guy who gets it to them."" 07:38We talked to somebody who, in addition
to his job, was caring for his aunt. He was making plenty of money. At one point we just asked, ""What is it about caring for your aunt?
Can't you just pay somebody to do it?"" He said, ""My aunt doesn't want
somebody we pay for. My aunt wants me."" So there was this concept there
of being needed. 07:56If you study the word
""dignity,"" it's fascinating. It's one of the oldest words
in the English language, from antiquity. And it has two meanings: one is self-worth, and the other is that something
is suitable, it's fitting, meaning that you're part
of something greater than yourself, and it connects to some broader whole. In other words, that you're needed. 08:15BF: So how do you answer this question, this concept that we don't pay teachers, and we don't pay eldercare workers, and we don't pay people
who really care for people and are needed, enough? 08:26RB: Well, the good news is,
people are finally asking the question. So as AI investors,
we often get phone calls from foundations or CEOs
and boardrooms saying, ""What do we do about this?"" And they used to be asking, ""What do we do about
introducing automation?"" And now they're asking,
""What do we do about self-worth?"" And they know that the employees
who work for them who have a spouse who cares for somebody, that dignity is essential
to their ability to just do their job. 08:50I think there's two kinds of answers: there's the money side
of just making your life work. That's stability. You need to eat. And then you think about
our culture more broadly, and you ask: Who do we make into heroes? And, you know, what I want
is to see the magazine cover that is the person
who is the heroic caregiver. Or the Netflix series
that dramatizes the person who makes all of our other lives work
so we can do the things we do. Let's make heroes out of those people. That's the Netflix show
that I would binge. 09:20And we've had chroniclers
of this before -- Studs Terkel, the oral history of the working
experience in the United States. And what we need is the experience
of needing one another and being connected to each other. Maybe that's the answer
for how we all fit as a society. And the thought exercise, to me, is: if you were to go back 100 years
and have people -- my grandparents, great-grandparents,
a tailor, worked in a mine -- they look at what all of us do
for a living and say, ""That's not work."" We sit there and type and talk,
and there's no danger of getting hurt. And my guess is that if you were
to imagine 100 years from now, we'll still be doing things
for each other. We'll still need one another. And we just will think of it as work. 10:00The entire thing I'm trying to say is that dignity should not
just be about having a job. Because if you say
you need a job to have dignity, which many people say, the second you say that,
you say to all the parents and all the teachers
and all the caregivers that all of a sudden, because they're not being paid
for what they're doing, it somehow lacks this
essential human quality. To me, that's the great
puzzle of our time: Can we figure out how to provide
that stability throughout life, and then can we figure out
how to create an inclusive, not just racially, gender,
but multigenerationally inclusive -- I mean, every different
human experience included -- in this way of understanding
how we can be needed by one another. 10:41BF: Thank you.
RB: Thank you. 10:42BF: Thank you very much
for your participation. 10:44(Applause)"

how AI and mankind can coexist, but first, we have to rethink
about our human values. So let me first make a confession
about my errors in my values. 00:13It was 11 o'clock, December 16, 1991. I was about to become a father
for the first time. My wife, Shen-Ling,
lay in the hospital bed going through a very difficult
12-hour labor. I sat by her bedside but looked anxiously at my watch, and I knew something that she didn't. I knew that if in one hour, our child didn't come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple's CEO. Fortunately, my daughter
was born at 11:30 -- 00:55(Laughter) 00:57(Applause) 00:59sparing me from doing the unthinkable, and to this day, I am so sorry for letting my work ethic
take precedence over love for my family. 01:10(Applause) 01:16My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly. 01:18(Laughter) 01:21Apple loved my work
and decided to announce it at TED1992, 26 years ago on this very stage. I thought I had made one of the biggest,
most important discoveries in AI, and so did the ""Wall Street Journal""
on the following day. 01:39footnotefootnoteBut as far as discoveries went, it turned out, I didn't discover India, or America. Perhaps I discovered
a little island off of Portugal. But the AI era of discovery continued, and more scientists
poured their souls into it. About 10 years ago, the grand AI discovery was made by three
North American scientists, and it's known as deep learning. 02:05Deep learning is a technology
that can take a huge amount of data within one single domain and learn to predict or decide
at superhuman accuracy. For example, if we show
the deep learning network a massive number of food photos, it can recognize food such as hot dog or no hot dog. 02:26(Applause) 02:29Or if we show it many pictures
and videos and sensor data from driving on the highway, it can actually drive a car
as well as a human being on the highway. And what if we showed
this deep learning network all the speeches made by President Trump? Then this artificially
intelligent President Trump, actually the network -- 02:55(Laughter) 02:57can -- 02:58(Applause) 03:02You like double oxymorons, huh? 03:05(Laughter) 03:09(Applause) 03:15So this network, if given the request
to make a speech about AI, he, or it, might say -- 03:24(Recording) Donald Trump:
It's a great thing to build a better world
with artificial intelligence. 03:29Kai-Fu Lee: And maybe in another language? 03:31DT: (Speaking Chinese) 03:33(Laughter) 03:34KFL: You didn't know
he knew Chinese, did you? 03:38So deep learning has become the core
in the era of AI discovery, and that's led by the US. But we're now in the era
of implementation, where what really matters is execution,
product quality, speed and data. And that's where China comes in. Chinese entrepreneurs, who I fund as a venture capitalist, are incredible workers, amazing work ethic. My example in the delivery room is nothing
compared to how hard people work in China. As an example, one startup
tried to claim work-life balance: ""Come work for us because we are 996."" And what does that mean? It means the work hours
of 9am to 9pm, six days a week. That's contrasted
with other startups that do 997. 04:27And the Chinese product quality
has consistently gone up in the past decade, and that's because of
a fiercely competitive environment. In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs
compete in a very gentlemanly fashion, sort of like in old wars
in which each side took turns to fire at each other. 04:47(Laughter) 04:48But in the Chinese environment, it's truly a gladiatorial
fight to the death. In such a brutal environment,
entrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly, they learn to make their products
better at lightning speed, and they learn
to hone their business models until they're impregnable. As a result, great Chinese products
like WeChat and Weibo are arguably better than the equivalent American products
from Facebook and Twitter. 05:19footnotefootnoteAnd the Chinese market
embraces this change and accelerated change
and paradigm shifts. As an example, if any of you go to China, you will see it's almost cashless
and credit card-less, because that thing that we all
talk about, mobile payment, has become the reality in China. In the last year, 18.8 trillion US dollars
were transacted on mobile internet, and that's because
of very robust technologies built behind it. It's even bigger than the China GDP. And this technology, you can say,
how can it be bigger than the GDP? Because it includes all transactions: wholesale, channels,
retail, online, offline, going into a shopping mall
or going into a farmers market like this. The technology is used
by 700 million people to pay each other, not just merchants, so it's peer to peer, and it's almost transaction-fee-free. And it's instantaneous, and it's used everywhere. And finally, the China market is enormous. This market is large, which helps give entrepreneurs
more users, more revenue, more investment, but most importantly, it gives the entrepreneurs a chance
to collect a huge amount of data which becomes rocket fuel
for the AI engine. So as a result, the Chinese AI companies have leaped ahead so that today, the most valuable companies in computer vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis,
machine translation and drones are all Chinese companies. 06:59footnotefootnoteSo with the US leading
the era of discovery and China leading
the era of implementation, we are now in an amazing age where the dual engine
of the two superpowers are working together to drive the fastest
revolution in technology that we have ever seen as humans. And this will bring tremendous wealth, unprecedented wealth: 16 trillion dollars, according to PwC, in terms of added GDP
to the worldwide GDP by 2030. It will also bring immense challenges in terms of potential job replacements. Whereas in the Industrial Age it created more jobs because craftsman jobs were being
decomposed into jobs in the assembly line, so more jobs were created. But AI completely replaces
the individual jobs in the assembly line with robots. And it's not just in factories, but truckers, drivers and even jobs like telesales,
customer service and hematologists as well as radiologists over the next 15 years are going to be gradually replaced by artificial intelligence. And only the creative jobs -- 08:20(Laughter) 08:22I have to make myself safe, right? Really, the creative jobs
are the ones that are protected, because AI can optimize but not create. 08:33But what's more serious
than the loss of jobs is the loss of meaning, because the work ethic
in the Industrial Age has brainwashed us into thinking
that work is the reason we exist, that work defined
the meaning of our lives. And I was a prime and willing victim
to that type of workaholic thinking. I worked incredibly hard. That's why I almost left
my wife in the delivery room, that's why I worked 996
alongside my entrepreneurs. And that obsession that I had with work ended abruptly a few years ago when I was diagnosed
with fourth stage lymphoma. The PET scan here shows
over 20 malignant tumors jumping out like fireballs, melting away my ambition. But more importantly, it helped me reexamine my life. Knowing that I may only have
a few months to live caused me to see how foolish it was for me to base my entire self-worth on how hard I worked
and the accomplishments from hard work. My priorities were
completely out of order. I neglected my family. My father had passed away, and I never had a chance
to tell him I loved him. My mother had dementia
and no longer recognized me, and my children had grown up. 10:04During my chemotherapy, I read a book by Bronnie Ware who talked about dying wishes and regrets
of the people in the deathbed. She found that facing death, nobody regretted that they didn't
work hard enough in this life. They only regretted that they didn't
spend enough time with their loved ones and that they didn't spread their love. 10:30So I am fortunately today in remission. 10:34(Applause) 10:41So I can be back at TED again to share with you
that I have changed my ways. I now only work 965 -- occasionally 996, but usually 965. I moved closer to my mother, my wife usually travels with me, and when my kids have vacation,
if they don't come home, I go to them. So it's a new form of life that helped me recognize how important it is that love is for me, and facing death
helped me change my life, but it also helped me see a new way of how AI should impact mankind and work and coexist with mankind, that really, AI is taking away
a lot of routine jobs, but routine jobs are not what we're about. 11:32Why we exist is love. When we hold our newborn baby, love at first sight, or when we help someone in need, humans are uniquely able
to give and receive love, and that's what differentiates us from AI. 11:48Despite what science fiction may portray, I can responsibly tell you
that AI has no love. When AlphaGo defeated
the world champion Ke Jie, while Ke Jie was crying
and loving the game of go, AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning and certainly no desire
to hug a loved one. 12:11So how do we differentiate ourselves as humans in the age of AI? We talked about the axis of creativity, and certainly that is one possibility, and now we introduce a new axis that we can call compassion,
love, or empathy. Those are things that AI cannot do. So as AI takes away the routine jobs, I like to think we can, we should
and we must create jobs of compassion. You might ask how many of those there are, but I would ask you: Do you not think that we are going
to need a lot of social workers to help us make this transition? Do you not think we need
a lot of compassionate caregivers to give more medical care to more people? Do you not think we're going to need
10 times more teachers to help our children find their way to survive and thrive
in this brave new world? And with all the newfound wealth, should we not also make
labors of love into careers and let elderly accompaniment or homeschooling become careers also? 13:18(Applause) 13:24This graph is surely not perfect, but it points at four ways
that we can work with AI. AI will come and take away
the routine jobs and in due time, we will be thankful. AI will become great tools
for the creatives so that scientists, artists,
musicians and writers can be even more creative. AI will work with humans
as analytical tools that humans can wrap their warmth around for the high-compassion jobs. And we can always differentiate ourselves with the uniquely capable jobs that are both compassionate and creative, using and leveraging
our irreplaceable brains and hearts. So there you have it: a blueprint of coexistence
for humans and AI. 14:15AI is serendipity. It is here to liberate us
from routine jobs, and it is here to remind us
what it is that makes us human. So let us choose to embrace AI
and to love one another. 14:28Thank you. 14:29(Applause)"
1,How AI can bring on a second Industrial Revolution,Kevin Kelly,Dec 2016,"""The actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley is unpredictable, but the general direction is inevitable,"" says digital visionary Kevin Kelly -- and technology is much the same, driven by patterns that are surprising but inevitable.

about where technology's going. And often technology comes to us, we're surprised by what it brings. But there's actually
a large aspect of technology that's much more predictable, and that's because technological systems
of all sorts have leanings, they have urgencies, they have tendencies. And those tendencies are derived
from the very nature of the physics, chemistry of wires
and switches and electrons, and they will make reoccurring
patterns again and again. And so those patterns produce
these tendencies, these leanings. 00:42You can almost think of it
as sort of like gravity. Imagine raindrops falling into a valley. The actual path of a raindrop
as it goes down the valley is unpredictable. We cannot see where it's going, but the general direction
is very inevitable: it's downward. And so these baked-in
tendencies and urgencies in technological systems give us a sense of where things
are going at the large form. So in a large sense, I would say that telephones
were inevitable, but the iPhone was not. The Internet was inevitable, but Twitter was not. 01:21So we have many ongoing
tendencies right now, and I think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things
smarter and smarter. I call it cognifying -- cognification -- also known as artificial
intelligence, or AI. And I think that's going to be one
of the most influential developments and trends and directions and drives
in our society in the next 20 years. 01:48So, of course, it's already here. We already have AI, and often it works in the background, in the back offices of hospitals, where it's used to diagnose X-rays
better than a human doctor. It's in legal offices, where it's used to go
through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer. It's used to fly the plane
that you came here with. Human pilots only flew it
seven to eight minutes, the rest of the time the AI was driving. And of course, in Netflix and Amazon, it's in the background,
making those recommendations. That's what we have today. 02:22And we have an example, of course,
in a more front-facing aspect of it, with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat
the world's greatest Go champion. But it's more than that. If you play a video game,
you're playing against an AI. But recently, Google taught their AI to actually learn how to play video games. Again, teaching video games
was already done, but learning how to play
a video game is another step. That's artificial smartness. What we're doing is taking
this artificial smartness and we're making it smarter and smarter. 03:06There are three aspects
to this general trend that I think are underappreciated; I think we would understand
AI a lot better if we understood these three things. I think these things also would
help us embrace AI, because it's only by embracing it
that we actually can steer it. We can actually steer the specifics
by embracing the larger trend. 03:27So let me talk about
those three different aspects. The first one is: our own intelligence
has a very poor understanding of what intelligence is. We tend to think of intelligence
as a single dimension, that it's kind of like a note
that gets louder and louder. It starts like with IQ measurement. It starts with maybe a simple
low IQ in a rat or mouse, and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee, and then maybe there's more
in a stupid person, and then maybe an average
person like myself, and then maybe a genius. And this single IQ intelligence
is getting greater and greater. That's completely wrong. That's not what intelligence is --
not what human intelligence is, anyway. It's much more like a symphony
of different notes, and each of these notes is played
on a different instrument of cognition. 04:15There are many types
of intelligences in our own minds. We have deductive reasoning, we have emotional intelligence, we have spatial intelligence; we have maybe 100 different types
that are all grouped together, and they vary in different strengths
with different people. And of course, if we go to animals,
they also have another basket -- another symphony of different
kinds of intelligences, and sometimes those same instruments
are the same that we have. They can think in the same way,
but they may have a different arrangement, and maybe they're higher
in some cases than humans, like long-term memory in a squirrel
is actually phenomenal, so it can remember
where it buried its nuts. But in other cases they may be lower. 04:58When we go to make machines, we're going to engineer
them in the same way, where we'll make some of those types
of smartness much greater than ours, and many of them won't be
anywhere near ours, because they're not needed. So we're going to take these things, these artificial clusters, and we'll be adding more varieties
of artificial cognition to our AIs. We're going to make them
very, very specific. 05:26So your calculator is smarter
than you are in arithmetic already; your GPS is smarter
than you are in spatial navigation; Google, Bing, are smarter
than you are in long-term memory. And we're going to take, again,
these kinds of different types of thinking and we'll put them into, like, a car. The reason why we want to put them
in a car so the car drives, is because it's not driving like a human. It's not thinking like us. That's the whole feature of it. It's not being distracted, it's not worrying about whether
it left the stove on, or whether it should have
majored in finance. It's just driving. 06:05(Laughter) 06:06Just driving, OK? And we actually might even
come to advertise these as ""consciousness-free."" They're without consciousness, they're not concerned about those things, they're not distracted. 06:17So in general, what we're trying to do is make as many different
types of thinking as we can. We're going to populate the space of all the different possible types,
or species, of thinking. And there actually may be some problems that are so difficult
in business and science that our own type of human thinking
may not be able to solve them alone. We may need a two-step program, which is to invent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve
these really large problems, say, like dark energy or quantum gravity. 06:56What we're doing
is making alien intelligences. You might even think of this
as, sort of, artificial aliens in some senses. And they're going to help
us think different, because thinking different
is the engine of creation and wealth and new economy. 07:13The second aspect of this
is that we are going to use AI to basically make a second
Industrial Revolution. The first Industrial Revolution
was based on the fact that we invented something
I would call artificial power. Previous to that, during the Agricultural Revolution, everything that was made
had to be made with human muscle or animal power. That was the only way
to get anything done. The great innovation during
the Industrial Revolution was, we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels, to make this artificial power
that we could use to do anything we wanted to do. So today when you drive down the highway, you are, with a flick of the switch,
commanding 250 horses -- 250 horsepower -- which we can use to build skyscrapers,
to build cities, to build roads, to make factories that would churn out
lines of chairs or refrigerators way beyond our own power. And that artificial power can also
be distributed on wires on a grid to every home, factory, farmstead, and anybody could buy
that artificial power, just by plugging something in. 08:27So this was a source
of innovation as well, because a farmer could take
a manual hand pump, and they could add this artificial
power, this electricity, and he'd have an electric pump. And you multiply that by thousands
or tens of thousands of times, and that formula was what brought us
the Industrial Revolution. All the things that we see,
all this progress that we now enjoy, has come from the fact
that we've done that. 08:50We're going to do
the same thing now with AI. We're going to distribute that on a grid, and now you can take that electric pump. You can add some artificial intelligence, and now you have a smart pump. And that, multiplied by a million times, is going to be this second
Industrial Revolution. So now the car is going down the highway, it's 250 horsepower,
but in addition, it's 250 minds. That's the auto-driven car. It's like a new commodity; it's a new utility. The AI is going to flow
across the grid -- the cloud -- in the same way electricity did. 09:22So everything that we had electrified, we're now going to cognify. And I would suggest, then, that the formula
for the next 10,000 start-ups is very, very simple, which is to take x and add AI. That is the formula,
that's what we're going to be doing. And that is the way
in which we're going to make this second Industrial Revolution. And by the way -- right now, this minute, you can log on to Google and you can purchase
AI for six cents, 100 hits. That's available right now. 09:54So the third aspect of this is that when we take this AI
and embody it, we get robots. And robots are going to be bots, they're going to be doing many
of the tasks that we have already done. A job is just a bunch of tasks, so they're going to redefine our jobs because they're going to do
some of those tasks. But they're also going to create
whole new categories, a whole new slew of tasks that we didn't know
we wanted to do before. They're going to actually
engender new kinds of jobs, new kinds of tasks that we want done, just as automation made up
a whole bunch of new things that we didn't know we needed before, and now we can't live without them. So they're going to produce
even more jobs than they take away, but it's important that a lot of the tasks
that we're going to give them are tasks that can be defined
in terms of efficiency or productivity. If you can specify a task, either manual or conceptual, that can be specified in terms
of efficiency or productivity, that goes to the bots. Productivity is for robots. What we're really good at
is basically wasting time. 11:04(Laughter) 11:05We're really good at things
that are inefficient. Science is inherently inefficient. It runs on that fact that you have
one failure after another. It runs on the fact that you make tests
and experiments that don't work, otherwise you're not learning. It runs on the fact that there is not
a lot of efficiency in it. Innovation by definition is inefficient, because you make prototypes, because you try stuff that fails,
that doesn't work. Exploration is inherently inefficiency. Art is not efficient. Human relationships are not efficient. These are all the kinds of things
we're going to gravitate to, because they're not efficient. Efficiency is for robots. We're also going to learn
that we're going to work with these AIs because they think differently than us. 11:50When Deep Blue beat
the world's best chess champion, people thought it was the end of chess. But actually, it turns out that today,
the best chess champion in the world is not an AI. And it's not a human. It's the team of a human and an AI. The best medical diagnostician
is not a doctor, it's not an AI, it's the team. We're going to be working with these AIs, and I think you'll be paid in the future by how well you work with these bots. So that's the third thing,
is that they're different, they're utility and they are going to be something
we work with rather than against. We're working with these
rather than against them. 12:30So, the future: Where does that take us? I think that 25 years from now,
they'll look back and look at our understanding
of AI and say, ""You didn't have AI. In fact,
you didn't even have the Internet yet, compared to what we're going
to have 25 years from now."" There are no AI experts right now. There's a lot of money going to it, there are billions of dollars
being spent on it; it's a huge business, but there are no experts, compared
to what we'll know 20 years from now. So we are just at the beginning
of the beginning, we're in the first hour of all this. We're in the first hour of the Internet. We're in the first hour of what's coming. The most popular AI product
in 20 years from now, that everybody uses, has not been invented yet. That means that you're not late. 13:23Thank you. 13:24(Laughter) 13:25(Applause)"
1,Why fascism is so tempting — and how your data could power it,Yuval Noah Harari,May 2018,"In a profound talk about technology and power, author and historian Yuval Noah Harari explains the important difference between fascism and nationalism -- and what the consolidation of our data means for the future of democracy.

It's a bit funny, because I did write
that humans will become digital, but I didn't think it will happen so fast and that it will happen to me. But here I am, as a digital avatar, and here you are, so let's start. And let's start with a question. How many fascists are there
in the audience today? 00:26(Laughter) 00:27Well, it's a bit difficult to say, because we've forgotten what fascism is. People now use the term ""fascist"" as a kind of general-purpose abuse. Or they confuse fascism with nationalism. So let's take a few minutes
to clarify what fascism actually is, and how it is different from nationalism. 00:53The milder forms of nationalism
have been among the most benevolent of human creations. Nations are communities
of millions of strangers who don't really know each other. For example, I don't know
the eight million people who share my Israeli citizenship. But thanks to nationalism, we can all care about one another
and cooperate effectively. This is very good. Some people, like John Lennon,
imagine that without nationalism, the world will be a peaceful paradise. But far more likely, without nationalism,
we would have been living in tribal chaos. If you look today at the most prosperous
and peaceful countries in the world, countries like Sweden
and Switzerland and Japan, you will see that they have
a very strong sense of nationalism. In contrast, countries that lack
a strong sense of nationalism, like Congo and Somalia and Afghanistan, tend to be violent and poor. 02:04So what is fascism, and how
is it different from nationalism? Well, nationalism tells me
that my nation is unique, and that I have special obligations
towards my nation. Fascism, in contrast, tells me
that my nation is supreme, and that I have exclusive
obligations towards it. I don't need to care about anybody
or anything other than my nation. Usually, of course,
people have many identities and loyalties to different groups. For example, I can be a good patriot,
loyal to my country, and at the same time,
be loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty. Of course, when I have different
identities and loyalties, it sometimes creates conflicts
and complications. But, well, who ever told you
that life was easy? Life is complicated. Deal with it. 03:14Fascism is what happens when people try
to ignore the complications and to make life too easy for themselves. Fascism denies all identities
except the national identity and insists that I have obligations
only towards my nation. If my nation demands
that I sacrifice my family, then I will sacrifice my family. If the nation demands
that I kill millions of people, then I will kill millions of people. And if my nation demands
that I betray truth and beauty, then I should betray truth and beauty. For example, how does
a fascist evaluate art? How does a fascist decide whether a movie
is a good movie or a bad movie? Well, it's very, very, very simple. There is really just one yardstick: if the movie serves
the interests of the nation, it's a good movie; if the movie doesn't serve
the interests of the nation, it's a bad movie. That's it. Similarly, how does a fascist decide
what to teach kids in school? Again, it's very simple. There is just one yardstick: you teach the kids whatever serves
the interests of the nation. The truth doesn't matter at all. 04:48Now, the horrors of the Second World War
and of the Holocaust remind us of the terrible consequences
of this way of thinking. But usually, when we talk
about the ills of fascism, we do so in an ineffective way, because we tend to depict fascism
as a hideous monster, without really explaining
what was so seductive about it. It's a bit like these Hollywood movies
that depict the bad guys -- Voldemort or Sauron
or Darth Vader -- as ugly and mean and cruel. They're cruel even
to their own supporters. When I see these movies,
I never understand -- why would anybody be tempted to follow
a disgusting creep like Voldemort? The problem with evil
is that in real life, evil doesn't necessarily look ugly. It can look very beautiful. This is something that
Christianity knew very well, which is why in Christian art,
as [opposed to] Hollywood, Satan is usually depicted
as a gorgeous hunk. This is why it's so difficult
to resist the temptations of Satan, and why it is also difficult
to resist the temptations of fascism. 06:10Fascism makes people see themselves as belonging to the most beautiful
and most important thing in the world -- the nation. And then people think, ""Well, they taught us
that fascism is ugly. But when I look in the mirror,
I see something very beautiful, so I can't be a fascist, right?"" Wrong. That's the problem with fascism. When you look in the fascist mirror, you see yourself as far more beautiful
than you really are. In the 1930s, when Germans
looked in the fascist mirror, they saw Germany as the most
beautiful thing in the world. If today, Russians look
in the fascist mirror, they will see Russia as the most
beautiful thing in the world. And if Israelis look
in the fascist mirror, they will see Israel as the most
beautiful thing in the world. This does not mean that we are now
facing a rerun of the 1930s. 07:12Fascism and dictatorships might come back, but they will come back in a new form, a form which is much more relevant to the new technological realities
of the 21st century. In ancient times, land was the most important
asset in the world. Politics, therefore,
was the struggle to control land. And dictatorship meant that all the land
was owned by a single ruler or by a small oligarch. And in the modern age,
machines became more important than land. Politics became the struggle
to control the machines. And dictatorship meant that too many of the machines
became concentrated in the hands of the government
or of a small elite. Now data is replacing
both land and machines as the most important asset. Politics becomes the struggle
to control the flows of data. And dictatorship now means that too much data is being concentrated
in the hands of the government or of a small elite. 08:28The greatest danger
that now faces liberal democracy is that the revolution
in information technology will make dictatorships
more efficient than democracies. 08:42In the 20th century, democracy and capitalism
defeated fascism and communism because democracy was better
at processing data and making decisions. Given 20th-century technology, it was simply inefficient to try
and concentrate too much data and too much power in one place. 09:07But it is not a law of nature that centralized data processing
is always less efficient than distributed data processing. With the rise of artificial intelligence
and machine learning, it might become feasible to process
enormous amounts of information very efficiently in one place, to take all the decisions in one place, and then centralized data processing
will be more efficient than distributed data processing. And then the main handicap
of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century -- their attempt to concentrate
all the information in one place -- it will become their greatest advantage. 09:58Another technological danger
that threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology
with biotechnology, which might result
in the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself. And once you have such algorithms, an external system, like the government, cannot just predict my decisions, it can also manipulate
my feelings, my emotions. A dictator may not be able
to provide me with good health care, but he will be able to make me love him and to make me hate the opposition. Democracy will find it difficult
to survive such a development because, in the end, democracy is not based
on human rationality; it's based on human feelings. During elections and referendums, you're not being asked,
""What do you think?"" You're actually being asked,
""How do you feel?"" And if somebody can manipulate
your emotions effectively, democracy will become
an emotional puppet show. 11:18So what can we do to prevent
the return of fascism and the rise of new dictatorships? The number one question that we face
is: Who controls the data? If you are an engineer, then find ways to prevent too much data from being concentrated in too few hands. And find ways to make sure the distributed data processing
is at least as efficient as centralized data processing. This will be the best
safeguard for democracy. As for the rest of us
who are not engineers, the number one question facing us is how not to allow
ourselves to be manipulated by those who control the data. 12:11The enemies of liberal democracy,
they have a method. They hack our feelings. Not our emails, not our bank accounts -- they hack our feelings of fear
and hate and vanity, and then use these feelings to polarize and destroy
democracy from within. This is actually a method that Silicon Valley pioneered
in order to sell us products. But now, the enemies of democracy
are using this very method to sell us fear and hate and vanity. They cannot create
these feelings out of nothing. So they get to know our own
preexisting weaknesses. And then use them against us. And it is therefore
the responsibility of all of us to get to know our weaknesses and make sure that they
do not become a weapon in the hands of the enemies of democracy. 13:15Getting to know our own weaknesses will also help us to avoid the trap
of the fascist mirror. As we explained earlier,
fascism exploits our vanity. It makes us see ourselves
as far more beautiful than we really are. This is the seduction. But if you really know yourself, you will not fall
for this kind of flattery. If somebody puts a mirror
in front of your eyes that hides all your ugly bits
and makes you see yourself as far more beautiful
and far more important than you really are, just break that mirror. 14:01Thank you. 14:02(Applause) 14:10Chris Anderson: Yuval, thank you. Goodness me. It's so nice to see you again. So, if I understand you right, you're alerting us
to two big dangers here. One is the possible resurgence
of a seductive form of fascism, but close to that, dictatorships
that may not exactly be fascistic, but control all the data. I wonder if there's a third concern that some people here
have already expressed, which is where, not governments,
but big corporations control all our data. What do you call that, and how worried should we be about that? 14:44Yuval Noah Harari: Well, in the end,
there isn't such a big difference between the corporations
and the governments, because, as I said, the questions is:
Who controls the data? This is the real government. If you call it a corporation
or a government -- if it's a corporation
and it really controls the data, this is our real government. So the difference
is more apparent than real. 15:06CA: But somehow,
at least with corporations, you can imagine market mechanisms
where they can be taken down. I mean, if consumers just decide that the company is no longer
operating in their interest, it does open the door to another market. It seems easier to imagine that than, say, citizens rising up
and taking down a government that is in control of everything. 15:25YNH: Well, we are not there yet, but again, if a corporation really
knows you better than you know yourself -- at least that it can manipulate
your own deepest emotions and desires, and you won't even realize -- you will think this is
your authentic self. So in theory, yes, in theory,
you can rise against a corporation, just as, in theory, you can rise
against a dictatorship. But in practice,
it is extremely difficult. 15:55CA: So in ""Homo Deus,"" you argue
that this would be the century when humans kind of became gods, either through development
of artificial intelligence or through genetic engineering. Has this prospect of political
system shift, collapse impacted your view on that possibility? 16:17YNH: Well, I think it makes it
even more likely, and more likely
that it will happen faster, because in times of crisis,
people are willing to take risks that they wouldn't otherwise take. And people are willing to try all kinds of high-risk,
high-gain technologies. So these kinds of crises
might serve the same function as the two world wars in the 20th century. The two world wars greatly accelerated the development of new
and dangerous technologies. And the same thing might happen
in the 21st century. I mean, you need to be
a little crazy to run too fast, let's say, with genetic engineering. But now you have more
and more crazy people in charge of different
countries in the world, so the chances are getting
higher, not lower. 17:11CA: So, putting it all together, Yuval,
you've got this unique vision. Roll the clock forward 30 years. What's your guess --
does humanity just somehow scrape through, look back and say, ""Wow,
that was a close thing. We did it!"" Or not? 17:24YNH: So far, we've managed
to overcome all the previous crises. And especially if you look
at liberal democracy and you think things are bad now, just remember how much worse
things looked in 1938 or in 1968. So this is really nothing,
this is just a small crisis. But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never
underestimate human stupidity. 17:53(Laughter) (Applause) 17:54It is one of the most powerful forces
that shape history. 17:59CA: Yuval, it's been an absolute delight
to have you with us. Thank you for making the virtual trip. Have a great evening there in Tel Aviv. Yuval Harari! 18:07YNH: Thank you very much. 18:08(Applause)"

Perceptive and impressionable like a real 11-year-old, the virtual boy watches, listens and learns -- recognizing and responding to you.", (26K),"Transcript (24 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect -- it was called Natal -- I was inspired, and I thought for a moment, maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling, to create a character which seemed alive, which noticed me, that could look me in the eyes and feel real, and sculpt a story about our relationship. And so a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3. And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. And there was a huge row online about, ""Hey, this can't be real."" And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. 00:53Now, this tech incorporates three big elements. The first is a Kinect camera, which will be out in November, some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults, collecting dust in Microsoft, plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead, mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea: to create a real, living being in a computer. Now, I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick, but it's a trick that actually works. 01:38So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. This is Dimitri. Dimitri, just waggle your arm around. Now, you notice he's sitting. There are no controllers, no keyboards, or mice, or joysticks, or joypads. He is just going to use his hand, his body and his voice, just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice. 02:06So let's move forward. You're going to meet Milo for the first time. We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo, we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat, to be honest with you. He was quite a know-it-all, and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. So the problem we introduced to him was this: he's just moved house. He's moved from London to New England, over in America. His parents are too busy to listen to his problems, and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. So here he is walking through the grass. And you're able to interact with his world. The cool thing is, what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. That means no two people's Milos can be the same. You're actually sculpting a human being here. So, he's discovering the garden. You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. Very simple at the start. By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails; if you're a girl, it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. 03:23(Laughter) 03:29So remember, this is the first time you've met him, and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious. His face, by the way, is fully AI-driven. We have complete control over his blush responses, the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. We actually do something called body matching. If you're leaning forward, he will try and slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face, because we went out with this strong idea: how can we make you believe that something's real? Now we've used the hand. The other thing to use is your body. Why not just, instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad, why not use your body just to lean on the chair -- again, relaxed? You can lean back, but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. 04:26So Dimitri's now going to use -- he's used his hand; he's used his body. He's now going to use the other thing which is essential, and that's his voice. Now, the thing about voice is, our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful, isn't it? It never works. You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu. So we've tackled that problem, and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second. 04:52Milo: I could just squish it. 04:54Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri? 04:56Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops. Do you want Milo to squash it? When you see the microphone, say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide. 05:09Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it. 05:12PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do. Now look at his response. He said, ""Go on, Milo. Squash it."" What we're using there is, we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme. It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. We've got a database of words which we recognize. We pick those words out. We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice, or the user's voice. Now we need to have a bit more engagement, and again, what we can do is we can look at the body. And we'll do that in a second. 05:48Milo: I wonder how deep it is. Deep. 06:01PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. We're actually teaching him. It's very, very interesting that men, more than women, tend to be more competitive here. They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws, but then they want to beat Milo, where women, they're more nurturing about this. Okay, this is skimming stones. How do you skim stones? You stand up, and you skim the stone. It's that simple. Just recognizing your body, recognizing the body's motions, the tech, understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. Again, all of this is done in the way us humans do things, and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. 06:58Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better. Try hitting the boat. 07:10Milo: Ahhh. So close. 07:18PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive. Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done. 07:24Milo: Okay. 07:27PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents, giving us time to be alone and to help him out. Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start -- his parents had asked him to clean up his room. And we're going to help him with this now. But this is going to be an introduction, and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. Now, to do that, we needed a set up, like a magician's trick. And what we did was, we needed to give Milo this big problem. 08:04So as Dimitri starts tidying up, you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. 08:13Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!) 08:15Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new. 08:17PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet. We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children. Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. It's all been too much for him. He's just moved house. He's got no friends. Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. 08:42Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. 08:47Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like. They're always getting stressed. 08:53Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway? We don't know anyone. 09:00Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to. You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends. Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all. 09:13Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo. You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. 09:22Milo: It was good skimming stones. This looks nice. You cleaned up my room. Thanks. 09:39PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you. And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen, that is a truly wonderful moment. And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life, and it goes on, and he has, you know, many adventures. Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he's got to go to school. 10:04The cool thing is that we're doing as well: as you interact with him, you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects. His mind is based in a cloud. That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer. He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. 10:26But for me, this is a wonderful opportunity where technology, at last, can be connected with, where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. And I love those revolutions, and I love the future that Milo brings. 10:49Thank you very much indeed. 10:51(Applause)"
1,The medical potential of AI and metabolites,Leila Pirhaji,Oct 2019,"Many diseases are driven by metabolites -- small molecules in your body like fat, glucose and cholesterol -- but we don't know exactly what they are or how they work. Biotech entrepreneur and TED Fellow Leila Pirhaji shares her plan to build an AI-based network to characterize metabolite patterns, better understand how disease develops -- and discover more effective treatments.", (59K),"Transcript (31 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیहिन्दीবাংলাગુજરાતીမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer
to treat many diseases. But the reality is far from that, because in addition to our genes, our environment and lifestyle
could have a significant role in developing many major diseases. 00:23One example is fatty liver disease, which is affecting over 20 percent
of the population globally, and it has no treatment
and leads to liver cancer or liver failure. So sequencing DNA alone
doesn't give us enough information to find effective therapeutics. 00:44On the bright side, there are
many other molecules in our body. In fact, there are
over 100,000 metabolites. Metabolites are any molecule
that is supersmall in their size. Known examples are glucose,
fructose, fats, cholesterol -- things we hear all the time. Metabolites are involved
in our metabolism. They are also downstream of DNA, so they carry information
from both our genes as well as lifestyle. Understanding metabolites is essential
to find treatments for many diseases. 01:22I've always wanted to treat patients. Despite that, 15 years ago,
I left medical school, as I missed mathematics. Soon after, I found the coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study medicine. Since then, I've been developing
algorithms to analyze biological data. So, it sounded easy: let's collect data from all
the metabolites in our body, develop mathematical models to describe
how they are changed in a disease and intervene in those
changes to treat them. 02:02Then I realized why no one
has done this before: it's extremely difficult. 02:08(Laughter) 02:10There are many metabolites in our body. Each one is different from the other one. For some metabolites,
we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments. But because there could be, like,
10 molecules with the exact same mass, we don't know exactly what they are, and if you want to clearly
identify all of them, you have to do more experiments,
which could take decades and billions of dollars. 02:36So we developed an artificial
intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that. We leveraged the growth of biological data and built a database of any existing
information about metabolites and their interactions
with other molecules. We combined all this data
as a meganetwork. Then, from tissues or blood of patients, we measure masses of metabolites and find the masses
that are changed in a disease. But, as I mentioned earlier,
we don't know exactly what they are. A molecular mass of 180 could be
either the glucose, galactose or fructose. They all have the exact same mass but different functions in our body. Our AI algorithm considered
all these ambiguities. It then mined that meganetwork to find how those metabolic masses
are connected to each other that result in disease. And because of the way they are connected, then we are able to infer
what each metabolite mass is, like that 180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose
and other metabolites lead to a disease. This novel understanding
of disease mechanisms then enable us to discover
effective therapeutics to target that. 03:55So we formed a start-up company
to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives. Now my team and I at ReviveMed
are working to discover therapeutics for major diseases
that metabolites are key drivers for, like fatty liver disease, because it is caused
by accumulation of fats, which are types
of metabolites in the liver. As I mentioned earlier,
it's a huge epidemic with no treatment. 04:21And fatty liver disease
is just one example. Moving forward, we are going to tackle
hundreds of other diseases with no treatment. And by collecting more and more
data about metabolites and understanding
how changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases, our algorithms will get
smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutics
for the right patients. And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code. 04:56Thank you. 04:57(Applause)"
1,"Building ""self-aware"" robots",Hod Lipson,Oct 2007,"Hod Lipson demonstrates a few of his cool little robots, which have the ability to learn, understand themselves and even self-replicate.", (45K),"Transcript (29 Languages)CatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So, where are the robots? We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon. Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here. Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work, but we don't have any robots. So what can we do about that? What can we say? So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way. And this is an x-ray picture of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that -- what was true then is certainly true today. We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces. We can make the circuitry of the right computational power, but we can't actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems. 00:56So let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers. Let's see what evolution can do for us. So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons. Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection, under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward. A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that. 01:27So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all move around. They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right, that we actually made a couple of these things, and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots, but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for: 01:45for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation, but we can also do that on a real machine. Here's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains, competing, or evolving on the machine. It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine, and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously. 02:18So in these two examples, we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation, and also machines that learned how to walk in reality. But I want to show you a different approach, and this is this robot over here, which has four legs. It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip. It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting. 02:43But this machine doesn't know what it looks like. You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out. Initially, it does some random motion, and then it tries to figure out what it might look like. And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds, a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models, like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models. 03:20This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model, it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion. So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion. We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk, but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward. 03:43But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself. It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward, and then actually tried that out. (Applause) 04:06So, we'll move forward to a different idea. So that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK -- (Laughter) -- they don't like each other. So there's a different robot. That's what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something. What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in? 04:33So we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here. The cube can swivel, or flip on its side, and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup -- this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything, we just let them flip. We pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations. So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there. But after a very short while, you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over. 05:00They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward, the intrinsic reward is self-replication. And we've actually built a couple of these, and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process. So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case -- and more energy, and it can make another robot. So of course, this is a very crude machine, but we're working on a micro-scale version of these, and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. 05:32OK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots, and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually, but actually let them evolve and learn, like children, and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you. (Applause)"
1,A new equation for intelligence,Alex Wissner-Gross,Feb 2014,"Is there an equation for intelligence? Yes. It's F = T ∇ Sτ. In a fascinating and informative talk, physicist and computer scientist Alex Wissner-Gross explains what in the world that means.", (64K),"Transcript (27 Languages)DanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Intelligence -- what is it? If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that ""the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim."" Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing. However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. 01:12Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course, as earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. 02:45So in this program that I
undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines, that were pointing, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology, for example, there have been a variety of
different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play, for example, in Go -- everyone remembers in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue beat 
Garry Kasparov at chess -- fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of Go, arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor, has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason: the best techniques right now
for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads? Is there a single equation for intelligence? 04:25And the answer, I believe, is yes.
[""F = T ∇ Sτ""] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc² for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize
future freedom of action and keep options open. And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this? How predictive is it? Does it predict human-level intelligence? Does it predict artificial intelligence? So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation. 05:34(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or ""entropy,"" over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent
beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship? What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it? To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence
tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action. 06:22Just like a human standing
upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large
disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk
from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling
opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields. 07:26Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping
the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and
utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation. 08:14Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-low, sell-high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. 08:34Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation, which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action. 08:55Now, there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play ""RUR,"" there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite, that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence, that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control-grabbing, rather than vice versa. 09:58Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework? And the answer is, the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense: just like you would travel through a tunnel, a bottleneck in your future path space, in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on, or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerges directly from a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action. 10:40Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future. 11:25Thank you very much. 11:26(Applause)"

of cosmic history, our universe has woken up and become aware of itself. From a small blue planet, tiny, conscious parts of our universe
have begun gazing out into the cosmos with telescopes, discovering something humbling. We've discovered that our universe
is vastly grander than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost
imperceptibly small perturbation on an otherwise dead universe. But we've also discovered
something inspiring, which is that the technology
we're developing has the potential to help life flourish like never before, not just for centuries
but for billions of years, and not just on earth but throughout
much of this amazing cosmos. 00:47I think of the earliest life as ""Life 1.0"" because it was really dumb, like bacteria, unable to learn
anything during its lifetime. I think of us humans as ""Life 2.0""
because we can learn, which we in nerdy, geek speak, might think of as installing
new software into our brains, like languages and job skills. ""Life 3.0,"" which can design not only
its software but also its hardware of course doesn't exist yet. But perhaps our technology
has already made us ""Life 2.1,"" with our artificial knees,
pacemakers and cochlear implants. 01:21So let's take a closer look
at our relationship with technology, OK? As an example, the Apollo 11 moon mission
was both successful and inspiring, showing that when we humans
use technology wisely, we can accomplish things
that our ancestors could only dream of. But there's an even more inspiring journey propelled by something
more powerful than rocket engines, where the passengers
aren't just three astronauts but all of humanity. Let's talk about our collective
journey into the future with artificial intelligence. 01:56My friend Jaan Tallinn likes to point out
that just as with rocketry, it's not enough to make
our technology powerful. We also have to figure out,
if we're going to be really ambitious, how to steer it and where we want to go with it. So let's talk about all three
for artificial intelligence: the power, the steering
and the destination. 02:19Let's start with the power. I define intelligence very inclusively -- simply as our ability
to accomplish complex goals, because I want to include both
biological and artificial intelligence. And I want to avoid
the silly carbon-chauvinism idea that you can only be smart
if you're made of meat. It's really amazing how the power
of AI has grown recently. Just think about it. Not long ago, robots couldn't walk. Now, they can do backflips. Not long ago, we didn't have self-driving cars. Now, we have self-flying rockets. Not long ago, AI couldn't do face recognition. Now, AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face
saying stuff that you never said. Not long ago, AI couldn't beat us at the game of Go. Then, Google DeepMind's AlphaZero AI
took 3,000 years of human Go games and Go wisdom, ignored it all and became the world's best
player by just playing against itself. And the most impressive feat here
wasn't that it crushed human gamers, but that it crushed human AI researchers who had spent decades
handcrafting game-playing software. And AlphaZero crushed human AI researchers
not just in Go but even at chess, which we have been working on since 1950. 03:50So all this amazing recent progress in AI
really begs the question: How far will it go? I like to think about this question in terms of this abstract
landscape of tasks, where the elevation represents
how hard it is for AI to do each task at human level, and the sea level represents
what AI can do today. The sea level is rising
as AI improves, so there's a kind of global warming
going on here in the task landscape. And the obvious takeaway
is to avoid careers at the waterfront -- 04:21(Laughter) 04:22which will soon be
automated and disrupted. But there's a much
bigger question as well. How high will the water end up rising? Will it eventually rise
to flood everything, matching human intelligence at all tasks. This is the definition
of artificial general intelligence -- AGI, which has been the holy grail
of AI research since its inception. By this definition, people who say, ""Ah, there will always be jobs
that humans can do better than machines,"" are simply saying
that we'll never get AGI. Sure, we might still choose
to have some human jobs or to give humans income
and purpose with our jobs, but AGI will in any case
transform life as we know it with humans no longer being
the most intelligent. Now, if the water level does reach AGI, then further AI progress will be driven
mainly not by humans but by AI, which means that there's a possibility that further AI progress
could be way faster than the typical human research
and development timescale of years, raising the controversial possibility
of an intelligence explosion where recursively self-improving AI rapidly leaves human
intelligence far behind, creating what's known
as superintelligence. 05:39Alright, reality check: Are we going to get AGI any time soon? Some famous AI researchers,
like Rodney Brooks, think it won't happen
for hundreds of years. But others, like Google DeepMind
founder Demis Hassabis, are more optimistic and are working to try to make
it happen much sooner. And recent surveys have shown
that most AI researchers actually share Demis's optimism, expecting that we will
get AGI within decades, so within the lifetime of many of us, which begs the question -- and then what? What do we want the role of humans to be if machines can do everything better
and cheaper than us? 06:23The way I see it, we face a choice. One option is to be complacent. We can say, ""Oh, let's just build machines
that can do everything we can do and not worry about the consequences. Come on, if we build technology
that makes all humans obsolete, what could possibly go wrong?"" 06:38(Laughter) 06:40But I think that would be
embarrassingly lame. I think we should be more ambitious --
in the spirit of TED. Let's envision a truly inspiring
high-tech future and try to steer towards it. This brings us to the second part
of our rocket metaphor: the steering. We're making AI more powerful, but how can we steer towards a future where AI helps humanity flourish
rather than flounder? To help with this, I cofounded the Future of Life Institute. It's a small nonprofit promoting
beneficial technology use, and our goal is simply
for the future of life to exist and to be as inspiring as possible. You know, I love technology. Technology is why today
is better than the Stone Age. And I'm optimistic that we can create
a really inspiring high-tech future ... if -- and this is a big if -- if we win the wisdom race -- the race between the growing
power of our technology and the growing wisdom
with which we manage it. But this is going to require
a change of strategy because our old strategy
has been learning from mistakes. We invented fire, screwed up a bunch of times -- invented the fire extinguisher. 07:50(Laughter) 07:51We invented the car,
screwed up a bunch of times -- invented the traffic light,
the seat belt and the airbag, but with more powerful technology
like nuclear weapons and AGI, learning from mistakes
is a lousy strategy, don't you think? 08:05(Laughter) 08:06It's much better to be proactive
rather than reactive; plan ahead and get things
right the first time because that might be
the only time we'll get. But it is funny because
sometimes people tell me, ""Max, shhh, don't talk like that. That's Luddite scaremongering."" But it's not scaremongering. It's what we at MIT
call safety engineering. Think about it: before NASA launched
the Apollo 11 mission, they systematically thought through
everything that could go wrong when you put people
on top of explosive fuel tanks and launch them somewhere
where no one could help them. And there was a lot that could go wrong. Was that scaremongering? No. That's was precisely
the safety engineering that ensured the success of the mission, and that is precisely the strategy
I think we should take with AGI. Think through what can go wrong
to make sure it goes right. 08:56So in this spirit,
we've organized conferences, bringing together leading
AI researchers and other thinkers to discuss how to grow this wisdom
we need to keep AI beneficial. Our last conference
was in Asilomar, California last year and produced this list of 23 principles which have since been signed
by over 1,000 AI researchers and key industry leaders, and I want to tell you
about three of these principles. 09:19One is that we should avoid an arms race
and lethal autonomous weapons. The idea here is that any science
can be used for new ways of helping people or new ways of harming people. For example, biology and chemistry
are much more likely to be used for new medicines or new cures
than for new ways of killing people, because biologists
and chemists pushed hard -- and successfully -- for bans on biological
and chemical weapons. And in the same spirit, most AI researchers want to stigmatize
and ban lethal autonomous weapons. Another Asilomar AI principle is that we should mitigate
AI-fueled income inequality. I think that if we can grow
the economic pie dramatically with AI and we still can't figure out
how to divide this pie so that everyone is better off, then shame on us. 10:07(Applause) 10:11Alright, now raise your hand
if your computer has ever crashed. 10:15(Laughter) 10:16Wow, that's a lot of hands. Well, then you'll appreciate
this principle that we should invest much more
in AI safety research, because as we put AI in charge
of even more decisions and infrastructure, we need to figure out how to transform
today's buggy and hackable computers into robust AI systems
that we can really trust, because otherwise, all this awesome new technology
can malfunction and harm us, or get hacked and be turned against us. And this AI safety work
has to include work on AI value alignment, because the real threat
from AGI isn't malice, like in silly Hollywood movies, but competence -- AGI accomplishing goals
that just aren't aligned with ours. For example, when we humans drove
the West African black rhino extinct, we didn't do it because we were a bunch
of evil rhinoceros haters, did we? We did it because
we were smarter than them and our goals weren't aligned with theirs. But AGI is by definition smarter than us, so to make sure that we don't put
ourselves in the position of those rhinos if we create AGI, we need to figure out how
to make machines understand our goals, adopt our goals and retain our goals. 11:25And whose goals should these be, anyway? Which goals should they be? 11:30This brings us to the third part
of our rocket metaphor: the destination. We're making AI more powerful, trying to figure out how to steer it, but where do we want to go with it? This is the elephant in the room
that almost nobody talks about -- not even here at TED -- because we're so fixated
on short-term AI challenges. Look, our species is trying to build AGI, motivated by curiosity and economics, but what sort of future society
are we hoping for if we succeed? We did an opinion poll on this recently, and I was struck to see that most people actually
want us to build superintelligence: AI that's vastly smarter
than us in all ways. What there was the greatest agreement on
was that we should be ambitious and help life spread into the cosmos, but there was much less agreement
about who or what should be in charge. And I was actually quite amused to see that there's some some people
who want it to be just machines. 12:30(Laughter) 12:32And there was total disagreement
about what the role of humans should be, even at the most basic level, so let's take a closer look
at possible futures that we might choose
to steer toward, alright? 12:43So don't get me wrong here. I'm not talking about space travel, merely about humanity's
metaphorical journey into the future. So one option that some
of my AI colleagues like is to build superintelligence
and keep it under human control, like an enslaved god, disconnected from the internet and used to create unimaginable
technology and wealth for whoever controls it. But Lord Acton warned us that power corrupts,
and absolute power corrupts absolutely, so you might worry that maybe
we humans just aren't smart enough, or wise enough rather, to handle this much power. Also, aside from any
moral qualms you might have about enslaving superior minds, you might worry that maybe
the superintelligence could outsmart us, break out and take over. But I also have colleagues
who are fine with AI taking over and even causing human extinction, as long as we feel the the AIs
are our worthy descendants, like our children. But how would we know that the AIs
have adopted our best values and aren't just unconscious zombies
tricking us into anthropomorphizing them? Also, shouldn't those people
who don't want human extinction have a say in the matter, too? Now, if you didn't like either
of those two high-tech options, it's important to remember
that low-tech is suicide from a cosmic perspective, because if we don't go far
beyond today's technology, the question isn't whether humanity
is going to go extinct, merely whether
we're going to get taken out by the next killer asteroid, supervolcano or some other problem
that better technology could have solved. 14:18So, how about having
our cake and eating it ... with AGI that's not enslaved but treats us well because its values
are aligned with ours? This is the gist of what Eliezer Yudkowsky
has called ""friendly AI,"" and if we can do this,
it could be awesome. It could not only eliminate negative
experiences like disease, poverty, crime and other suffering, but it could also give us
the freedom to choose from a fantastic new diversity
of positive experiences -- basically making us
the masters of our own destiny. 14:54So in summary, our situation with technology
is complicated, but the big picture is rather simple. Most AI researchers
expect AGI within decades, and if we just bumble
into this unprepared, it will probably be
the biggest mistake in human history -- let's face it. It could enable brutal,
global dictatorship with unprecedented inequality,
surveillance and suffering, and maybe even human extinction. But if we steer carefully, we could end up in a fantastic future
where everybody's better off: the poor are richer, the rich are richer, everybody is healthy
and free to live out their dreams. 15:35Now, hang on. Do you folks want the future
that's politically right or left? Do you want the pious society
with strict moral rules, or do you an hedonistic free-for-all, more like Burning Man 24/7? Do you want beautiful beaches,
forests and lakes, or would you prefer to rearrange
some of those atoms with the computers, enabling virtual experiences? With friendly AI, we could simply
build all of these societies and give people the freedom
to choose which one they want to live in because we would no longer
be limited by our intelligence, merely by the laws of physics. So the resources and space
for this would be astronomical -- literally. 16:13So here's our choice. We can either be complacent
about our future, taking as an article of blind faith that any new technology
is guaranteed to be beneficial, and just repeat that to ourselves
as a mantra over and over and over again as we drift like a rudderless ship
towards our own obsolescence. Or we can be ambitious -- thinking hard about how
to steer our technology and where we want to go with it to create the age of amazement. We're all here to celebrate
the age of amazement, and I feel that its essence should lie
in becoming not overpowered but empowered by our technology. 16:55Thank you. 16:57(Applause)"
1,Can a computer write poetry?,Oscar Schwartz,Jan 2016,"If you read a poem and feel moved by it, but then find out it was actually written by a computer, would you feel differently about the experience? Would you think that the computer had expressed itself and been creative, or would you feel like you had fallen for a cheap trick?

Can a computer write poetry? This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch
of other questions like: What is a computer? What is poetry? What is creativity? But these are questions that people spend their entire
lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try
a different approach. 00:30So up here, we have two poems. One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me
which one's which. Have a go: 00:43Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /
My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away. Am I not / A fly like thee? /
Or art not thou / A man like me? 00:50Poem 2: We can feel / Activist
through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non
all the night to start a / great otherwise (...) 00:58Alright, time's up. Hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human. OK, most of you. Hands up if you think Poem 2
was written by a human. Very brave of you, because the first one was written
by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language
from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe
a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut. 01:38Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.
It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar
or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all
if I / am not exhausted or weary. 01:50Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate
sodas! / You are really beautiful! Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins!
All / the stuff they've always talked about (...) 01:59Alright, time's up. So if you think the first poem
was written by a human, put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem
was written by a human, put your hand up. We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here. It was much harder. 02:17The answer is, the first poem was generated
by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written
by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be
one of my favorite human poets. 02:32(Laughter) 02:36So what we've just done now
is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed
by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think? Alan Turing believed that if
a computer was able to have a to have a text-based
conversation with a human, with such proficiency
such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking
to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said
to have intelligence. 03:03So in 2013, my friend
Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test
for poetry online. It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically, it's the game
we just played. You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written
by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands
of people have taken this test online, so we have results. 03:25And what are the results? Well, Turing said that if a computer
could fool a human 30 percent of the time
that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test
for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent
of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So, I think we have an answer
to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can. But if you're feeling
a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK. If you're having a bunch
of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because
this isn't the end of the story. 04:06Let's play our third and final test. Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human. 04:13Poem 1: Red flags the reason
for pretty flags. / And ribbons. Ribbons of flags / And wearing material /
Reasons for wearing material. (...) 04:21Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps
highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day /
I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, /
And then the brake is almost done (...) 04:32OK, time is up. So hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem 2
was written by a human. Whoa, that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very
human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem 2 was generated
by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on, let me describe
very quickly and simply, how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm
designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer
in artificial intelligence. So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order
to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text. 05:26So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all
thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model
according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning
of the words it's using. The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese,
it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language
from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless, it's able
to create a poem that seems more human
than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human. 06:10So what we've done here is,
more or less, a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,
is able to write a poem that fools a majority
of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore, according to the logic
of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer. 06:33(Laughter) 06:35Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough. 06:39So far we've had humans
that write like humans, we have computers that write
like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have,
perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers. 06:56So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blake
is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is more
of a computer than William Blake? 07:07(Laughter) 07:08These are questions
I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology. 07:20So my first insight is that,
for some reason, we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask,
""Can a computer write poetry?"" we're also asking, ""What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries
around this category? How do we say who or what
can be part of this category?"" This is an essentially
philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered
with a yes or no test, like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing
understood this, and that when he devised
his test back in 1950, he was doing it
as a philosophical provocation. 08:01So my second insight is that,
when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing
the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed,
more or less, since the 1950s. What we are doing with the Turing
test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what
constitutes humanness. So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake
is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course, this doesn't mean
that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein
was more of a computer. It simply means that the category
of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is something
that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time. 09:04So my final insight is that
the computer, more or less, works like a mirror
that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects
any idea of the human we teach it. 09:38So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial
intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer? 10:01But what we've seen just now is that the human
is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting,
concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin
to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, ""Can we build it?"" But we should also be asking ourselves, ""What idea of the human
do we want to have reflected back to us?"" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered
with software alone, but I think requires a moment
of species-wide, existential reflection. 10:39Thank you. 10:40(Applause)"
1,Get ready for hybrid thinking,Ray Kurzweil,Jun 2014,"Two hundred million years ago, our mammal ancestors developed a new brain feature: the neocortex.

Rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have, it could invent new behaviors. So a mouse is escaping a predator, its path is blocked, it'll try to invent a new solution. That may work, it may not, but if it does, it will remember that and have a new behavior, and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community. Another mouse watching this could say, ""Hey, that was pretty clever, going around that rock,"" and it could adopt a new behavior as well. 00:54Non-mammalian animals couldn't do any of those things. They had fixed behaviors. Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime. In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes, it could evolve a new fixed behavior. That was perfectly okay 200 million years ago. The environment changed very slowly. It could take 10,000 years for there to be a significant environmental change, and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior. 01:21Now that went along fine, but then something happened. Sixty-five million years ago, there was a sudden, violent
change to the environment. We call it the Cretaceous extinction event. That's when the dinosaurs went extinct, that's when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct, and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche, and to anthropomorphize, biological evolution said, ""Hmm, this neocortex is pretty good stuff,"" and it began to grow it. And mammals got bigger, their brains got bigger at an even faster pace, and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area. If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out, it's about the size of a table napkin, and it's still a thin structure. It's about the thickness of a table napkin. But it has so many convolutions and ridges it's now 80 percent of our brain, and that's where we do our thinking, and it's the great sublimator. We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations, but I may have a drive for conquest, and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk, and it's really the neocortex that's where the action is. 02:44Fifty years ago, I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked, and I described it as a series of modules. Each module could do things with a pattern. It could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern. It could implement a pattern. And these modules were organized in hierarchies, and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking. And there was actually very little to go on 50 years ago. It led me to meet President Johnson. I've been thinking about this for 50 years, and a year and a half ago I came out with the book ""How To Create A Mind,"" which has the same thesis, but now there's a plethora of evidence. The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year. Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year. We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time, firing in real time. We can see your brain create your thoughts. We can see your thoughts create your brain, which is really key to how it works. 03:43So let me describe briefly how it works. I've actually counted these modules. We have about 300 million of them, and we create them in these hierarchies. I'll give you a simple example. I've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A, and that's all they care about. A beautiful song can play, a pretty girl could walk by, they don't care, but they see
a crossbar to a capital A, they get very excited and they say ""crossbar,"" and they put out a high probability on their output axon. That goes to the next level, and these layers are organized in conceptual levels. Each is more abstract than the next one, so the next one might say ""capital A."" That goes up to a higher
level that might say ""Apple."" Information flows down also. If the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L, it'll think to itself, ""Hmm, I
think an E is probably likely,"" and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying, ""Be on the lookout for an E, I think one might be coming."" The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy
thing, could be an E. Ordinarily you wouldn't think so, but we're expecting an E, it's good enough, and yeah, I've seen an E, and then apple says, ""Yeah, I've seen an Apple."" 04:51Go up another five levels, and you're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy, and stretch down into the different senses, and you may have a module
that sees a certain fabric, hears a certain voice quality,
smells a certain perfume, and will say, ""My wife has entered the room."" 05:06Go up another 10 levels, and now you're at a very high level. You're probably in the frontal cortex, and you'll have modules that say, ""That was ironic. That's funny. She's pretty."" 05:17You might think that those are more sophisticated, but actually what's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them. There was a 16-year-old girl, she had brain surgery, and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her. You can do that because there's no pain receptors in the brain. And whenever they stimulated particular, very small points on her neocortex, shown here in red, she would laugh. So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex, but no, they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor, and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points. ""You guys are so funny just standing around,"" was the typical comment, and they weren't funny, not while doing surgery. 06:02So how are we doing today? Well, computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. I actually described the algorithm, which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model, something I've worked on since the '90s. ""Jeopardy"" is a very broad natural language game, and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined. It got this query correct: ""A long, tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping,"" and it quickly responded,
""What is a meringue harangue?"" And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that. It's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language, and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias. 06:52Five to 10 years from now, search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding, reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books. So you'll be walking along, and Google will pop up and say, ""You know, Mary, you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood-brain barrier. Well, new research just came out 13 seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione. Let me summarize it for you."" 07:26Twenty years from now, we'll have nanobots, because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology. They'll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex. Now today, I mean, you have a computer in your phone, but if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds to do a complex search, you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. In the 2030s, if you need some extra neocortex, you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain. So I'm walking along and I say, ""Oh, there's Chris Anderson. He's coming my way. I'd better think of something clever to say. I've got three seconds. My 300 million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it. I need a billion more."" I'll be able to access that in the cloud. And our thinking, then, will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking, but the non-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns. It will grow exponentially. And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex? That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads. Other primates have a slanted brow. They don't have the frontal cortex. But the frontal cortex is not
really qualitatively different. It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex, but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences. No other species has done that. 09:08And so, over the next few decades, we're going to do it again. We're going to again expand our neocortex, only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure. It'll be expanded without limit. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology. 09:30Thank you very much. 09:32(Applause)"
1,How AI could empower any business,Andrew Ng,Sep 2022,"Expensive to build and often needing highly skilled engineers to maintain, artificial intelligence systems generally only pay off for large tech companies with vast amounts of data. But what if your local pizza shop could use AI to predict which flavor would sell best each day of the week? Andrew Ng shares a vision for democratizing access to AI, empowering any business to make decisions that will increase their profit and productivity. Learn how we could build a richer society – ...", (33K),"Transcript (6 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishFrançaisItalianoالعربية中文 (简体)00:00When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy. A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed
to be able to read and write. Back then, many people were
tending fields or herding sheep, so maybe there was less need
for written communication. And all that was needed was for the high priests
and priestesses and monks to be able to read the Holy Book, and the rest of us could just go
to the temple or church or the holy building and sit and listen to the high priest
and priestesses read to us. Fortunately, it was since figured out
that we can build a much richer society if lots of people can read and write. 00:38Today, AI is in the hands
of the high priests and priestesses. These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work
in the big tech companies. And most people have access
only to the AI that they build for them. I think that we can build
a much richer society if we can enable everyone
to help to write the future. 01:00But why is AI largely concentrated
in the big tech companies? Because many of these AI projects
have been expensive to build. They may require dozens
of highly skilled engineers, and they may cost millions
or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones
with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else
at making these investments pay off because, for them,
a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products
for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very
large numbers of users to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech
and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects
that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. 01:57Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes
from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman
that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot
of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor
of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. And this is data
that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. 02:34AI systems are good at spotting patterns
when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot
if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him
to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me,
""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?"" And I say, to the gentleman
that owns this pizza store, something that could help him
improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year,
that will be a huge deal to him. 03:05I know that there is a lot of hype about
AI's need for massive data sets, and having more data does help. But contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even on modest amounts of data, such as the data generated
by a single pizza store. So the real problem is not that there isn’t enough data
from the pizza store. The real problem is
that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. I know that in the United States there are about half a million
independent restaurants. And collectively, these restaurants
do serve tens of millions of customers. But every restaurant is different
with a different menu, different customers,
different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI
would work for all of them. 03:54What would it be like
if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? Let's take a look
at what it might look like at a company that makes
and sells T-shirts. I would love if an accountant working
for the T-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting. Say, figure out what funny memes
to prints on T-shirts that would drive sales, by looking at what's trending
on social media. Or for product placement, why can’t a front-of-store manager
take pictures of what the store looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend
where to place products to improve sales? Supply chain. Can an AI recommend to a buyer
whether or not they should pay 20 dollars per yard for a piece of fabric now, or if they should keep looking because they might be able to find
it cheaper elsewhere? Or quality control. A quality inspector
should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures
of the fabric they use to make T-shirts to check if there are any tears
or discolorations in the cloth. 04:55Today, large tech companies routinely
use AI to solve problems like these and to great effect. But a typical T-shirt company
or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local farm will be using AI for exactly zero
of these applications today. Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently
different from every other T-shirt maker that there is no one-size-fits-all AI
that will work for all of them. And in fact, once you go outside
the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even large companies such as the pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, the hospitals, also struggle with this. 05:38This is the long-tail problem of AI. If you were to take all current
and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing
order of value and plot them, you get a graph that looks like this. Maybe the single most valuable AI system is something that decides what ads
to show people on the internet. Maybe the second most valuable
is a web search engine, maybe the third most valuable is an online
shopping product recommendation system. But when you go
to the right of this curve, you then get projects
like T-shirt product placement or T-shirt demand forecasting
or pizzeria demand forecasting. And each of these is a unique project
that needs to be custom-built. Even T-shirt demand forecasting, if it depends on trending memes
on social media, is a very different project
than pizzeria demand forecasting, if that depends
on the pizzeria sales data. So today there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution
that no one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive. 06:42So how can we enable
small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter to them? For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system,
this is what you have to do. You have to write pages
and pages of code. And while I would love
for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education
and also offline education are helping more people
than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not everyone
has the time to do this. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems
that will let more people participate. Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology
to stone tablet and chisel, were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new
AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you
to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And this turns out to be much easier
for a lot of people to do. 07:39Today, there are multiple companies
working on platforms like these. Let me illustrate a few of the concepts
using one that my team has been building. Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help
detect defects in fabric. An inspector can take
pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and they can go in to show the AI
what tears in the fabric look like by drawing rectangles. And they can also go in to show the AI what discoloration
on the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles. So these pictures, together with the green
and pink rectangles that the inspector's drawn, are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find
tears and discoloration. After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen
enough pictures of tears, but not yet enough pictures
of discolorations. This is akin to if a junior inspector
had learned to reliably spot tears, but still needs to further hone
their judgment about discolorations. So the inspector can go back
and take more pictures of discolorations to show to the AI, to help it deepen this understanding. By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter. So an inspector using
an accessible platform like this can, in a few hours to a few days, and with purchasing
a suitable camera set up, be able to build a custom AI system
to detect defects, tears and discolorations in all the fabric being used to make T-shirts
throughout the factory. 09:13And once again, you may say, ""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory. Why is this a big deal?"" 09:20And I say to you, this is a big deal to that inspector
whose life this makes easier and equally, this type of technology
can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality
of the cakes they're making, or an organic farmer to check
the quality of the vegetables, or a furniture maker to check
the quality of the wood they're using. 09:41Platforms like these will probably
still need a few more years before they're easy enough to use
for every pizzeria owner. But many of these platforms
are coming along, and some of them
are getting to be quite useful to someone that is tech savvy today, with just a bit of training. But what this means is that, rather than relying
on the high priests and priestesses to write AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager, every buyer and every quality inspector
to build their own AI systems. 10:13I hope that the pizzeria owner and many other small
business owners like him will also take advantage
of this technology because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to create
tremendous wealth. And it's only by
democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth
is spread far and wide across society. 10:36Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone
understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing
access to AI will have. Building AI systems has been
out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we’ll empower everyone to build
AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be
incredibly exciting future. 11:06Thank you very much. 11:07(Applause)"
1,Is humanity smart enough to survive itself?,Jeanette Winterson,Aug 2022,"With quick wit and sharp insight, writer Jeanette Winterson lays out a vision of the future where human and machine intelligence meld -- forming what she calls ""alternative intelligence"" -- and takes a philosophical look at our species, asking: Are we smart enough to survive how smart we are? (Followed by a Q&A with TED's head of curation Helen Walters)", (35K),"Transcript (9 Languages)EnglishEspañolItalianoRomânăTürkçeСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)00:00Here's what gives me hope for humanity. I believe that we can change
our human nature for the better. This chance is unique. It's where we stand in history right now. No other generation
has stood here before us. 00:25Homo sapiens has been around
for about 300,000 years. Other humanoid life forms
have come and gone. We find their traces. We search for their stories. But we are the success story. We've survived natural disasters,
famines, floods, earthquakes, plagues, woolly mammoths,
mess-ups of our own making. We're smart, no question. The question is: Are we smart enough
to survive how smart we are? It's not looking so good just now, is it? 01:10(Laughter) 01:11We stand facing the possibility
of global conflict. If that happens, it will be our Third World War in not much more than 100 years. If Putin's violence stops today,
the problem doesn't go away. As across the globe dictatorism threatens democracy. I wonder whether as a species we can survive any of this, even if those threats disappear. Those living inside the snow globe
of their magical thinking will not be insulated
against the facts of climate breakdown. And yet, still, we go on
heating up the planet. Still we go on polluting the earth. Still we despoil our precious natural resources. 02:22250 years ago, we kick-started
the Industrial Revolution. The machine age. It's when we first hear the buzzwords
of the modern moment. Disruption, acceleration. That's Karl Marx, actually. Acceleration of production, the factory system,
acceleration of transport, the coming of the railways. No need for ships to wait for the wind. Coal-fired, steam-powered. Acceleration of information. The global village. And it's when we start
digging fossil fuels out of the ground in planet-changing quantities, when we start pushing carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. 03:09In a salami slice of space-time, human beings have changed the way
that we live on the planet forever. We've moved out of
the agricultural economies of our evolutionary inheritance into the industrial economies and beyond
of where we are now. There's no one else for us to turn to. There's no one else for us to blame. There is no us and them. There's only us. So will we continue to be
the success story of the known universe, or are we writing our own obituary? The suicide species? 03:54Now I was raised
in an evangelical household. We lived in end time. We were waiting for things to get so bad that Jesus would come back and save us. The apocalypse. It's what the prepper communities are,
well, prepping for. And it's why super rich white guys
are buying up tracts of land, hoping that they can live inside a kind of wi-fi-enabled Noah's Ark. 04:29(Laughter) 04:32Well, we can have the end time
if we want it. We know those stories from our religions,
our sci-fi, our movies. We are uniquely placed
to bring on the apocalypse. And we're uniquely placed
to save ourselves, too. If we could accept that as a species, Homo sapiens needs to evolve further. And that's what gives me hope, because we have the means
to evolve further. And that's AI. 05:06Now look, I don't mean
the geeks will inherit the earth. I'm sorry, geeks. You won't. 05:12(Laughter) 05:13I don’t really want to talk about narrow-
goal artificial intelligence at all. That term of John McCarthy’s,
“artificial intelligence,” is it any use to us now? I'd rather call it
alternative intelligence. And I think humankind is in need
of some alternative intelligence. 05:30In 1965, Jack Good
talked about AI as our last invention. He meant superintelligence, the kind of thing that worries
Bill Gates and Elon Musk. You know, the ""Terminator"" scenario. The final us and them. But I think that's all to do
with our doomster mindset. We don't have to vote for the apocalypse. 05:58Jack Good worked at Bletchley Park
with Alan Turing during World War II, building the early computing machinery
that would crack the Nazi Enigma code. Now after the war, Turing,
wrestling with the problems of a stored, programmed computer had a bigger dream on his mind. And in 1950, Alan Turing published a paper called “Computing Machinery
and Intelligence.” And in there, there's a chapter
that's titled ""Lady Lovelace's Objection"" where Turing time-travels back 100 years to have a conversation
with that long-dead genius, Ada Lovelace, the first person to write
mathematical programs for the computer not yet built by her friend
Charles Babbage. Now Ada wrote that as well as
doing awesome stuff with numbers, the computer would,
if correctly programmed, be able to write novels and compose music. That is a pretty big insight in 1843. 07:04""But,"" said Ada, ""The computer
should never have any pretensions to originate anything."" She meant, think creatively. Well, Ada's father was Lord Byron,
England's most famous poet, and England is the land of Shakespeare. More poets. And Ada had seen Charles Babbage's kit
all over the floor, and she wasn’t having some steampunk,
coal-fired nuts, bolts, bezels, levers, gears, cogs and chains,
crank-handled machine writing poetry. 07:38""Well,"" said Alan Turing,
""Was Lady Lovelace, correct? Could a computer ever be said
to originate anything? And what would be the difference
between computing intelligence and human intelligence?"" 07:53Well, I'll tell you one difference,
and it's optimistic. Computing power uses binary, but computing intelligence is nonbinary. It's humans who are obsessed
with false binaries. Male, female. Masculine, feminine. Black, white. Human, non-human. Us, them. AI has no skin color. AI has no race, no gender,
no faith in a sky God. AI is not interested
in men being superior to women, in white folks being smarter
than people of color. Straight, gay, gay, trans
are not separating categories for AI. AI does not distinguish
between success and failure by gold bars, yachts and Ferraris. AI is not motivated by fame and fortune. If we develop alternative intelligence,
it will be Buddhist in its non-needs. 08:56(Applause) 08:59Now I am aware that the algorithms
ubiquitous in everyday life are racist, sexist,
gendered, trivializing, stoke division, amplify bias. But what is this teaching us
about ourselves? AI is a tool. We are the ones who are using the tool. Hatred and contempt, money and power are human agendas, not AI agendas. We've been forced
to recognize the paucity, the inadequacy of our data sets. And humans are trained on data sets too. We've had to recognized
the unacknowledged ideologies that we live by every day. Rationality, neutrality,
logic, objective decision-making. What can we say about any of that when we see what we are
reflected back to us in the small screen? And it's not a pretty sight. AI is not yet self-aware. But we are becoming more self-aware
as we work with AI and we realize that Homo sapiens
is no longer fit for purpose. We need a reboot. So what are we going to choose? Apocalypse or an alternative? 10:23I believe that humans
have a strong future as a hybrid species as we start to merge
with the biotechnology we're creating, whether that's nanobots
in the bloodstream, monitoring our vital systems, whether it's genetic editing, whether it's 3D printing
of bespoke body parts, whether it’s neural implants
that will connect us directly to the web and to one another, insourcing information,
enhancing our cognitive capacities. And if we manage to upload consciousness, I think that the shift
from the transhuman to the posthuman world will seem natural,
an evolutionary necessity. 11:04Why do I say that? I say that because for millennia, all human beings have been obsessed
with the big question, the absurdity of death. We asked, ""Do we have souls?"" We watched the spirit
wait to leave the body. We created the world's first
disruptive startup, the afterlife. 11:28(Laughter) 11:29Now a multinational company, with a vast VR real estate portfolio. A mansion in the sky, sir? Our earliest extant written narrative,
The Epic of Gilgamesh, is a journey to discover
if there is life after death. And what is life after death? It is the extension of the self
beyond biological limits. 11:55Now I’m a writer, and I wonder,
have we been telling the story backwards? Did we know we would always get here, capable of creating
the kind of superintelligence that we said created us? We're told were made in God's image. God is immortal.
God is not a biological entity. 12:16Since the 17th century, the Enlightenment, science and religion have parted company. And science said, all that God thinking,
the afterlife stuff, it's folly, It's ignorance,
it's superstition. Suppose it was intuition. Suppose it was the only way
we could talk about what we knew, a fundamental, deep truth that this is not the last word. This is not the end of the story. That we are not time-bound creatures
caught in our bodies. That there is further to go. I'm fascinated that computing,
science and religion, like parallel lines that do meet in space, are now asking the same question: Is consciousness obliged to materiality? 13:03Now ... I accept that machine intelligence will challenge human intelligence. But the mythos of the world
is built around a group of stories that showcase an encounter
between a human and a nonhuman entity. Think of Jacob wrestling the angel. Think of Prometheus
bringing fire down from the gods. In these encounters,
both parties are changed, not always for the better. But it generally works out. We've been thinking
about this stuff forever. It's time that we created it. And we could have some fun stuff too. Who wants their own AI angel? Me. 13:45There's a message in a bottle
about this 200 years ago. When Ada Lovelace was busy getting born, her father, Lord Byron,
was on holiday on Lake Geneva with his friend, the poet Percy Shelley, and Shelley's wife, Mary Shelley. On a wet weekend with no internet Byron said -- 14:04(Laughter) 14:06""Let's write horror stories."" You know what happened. Out of that came the world's
most famous monster, Frankenstein. This is 1816, the start
of the Industrial Revolution. Mary Shelley is just 19 years old. In that novel, there is
an alternative intelligence made out of the body parts
from the graveyard and electricity. An astonishing vision because electricity
was not in any practical use at all and was hardly understood as a force. You know what happens.
The monster is not named. Not educated. Is outcast by his panicky creator,
Victor Frankenstein. And the whole thing ends
in a chase across the Arctic ice towards a Götterdämmerung
of death and destruction. The death wish that human beings
are so drawn to, perhaps because it's easier
to give up than to carry on. 14:57Well, we're the first generation who can read Mary Shelley's novel
in the right way, as a flare flung across time, because we too could create
an alternative intelligence, not out of the body parts
from the graveyard using electricity, but out of zeros and ones of code. And how is this going to end?
Utopia or dystopia? It's up to us. Endings are not set in stone. We change the story
because we are the story. 15:28Now, Marvin Minsky
called alternative intelligence our ""mind children."" Could we as proud parents accept that the new generation
that we will create will be smarter than we are? And could we accept
that the new generation we create need not be on a substrate made of meat? 15:51Thank you. 15:52(Applause) 15:59Thank you. 16:03Thank you very much. Thank you. 16:06Thank you. 16:08Helen Walters: Jeanette, stay right there. I have some questions. 16:13Jeanette Winterson:

our odds were of survival? 16:27JW: Look -- 16:28(Laughter) 16:30I'm an optimist. I’m a glass-half-full girl. So I know that we’re running out of time, time is the most precious
resource we have, and there isn't much of it. If we get this right soon,

each other with sticks and stones for scraps of food and water
on an overheated planet in the ruins of dictator-world. 16:50But -- 16:51(Laughter) 16:52OK. But we could get it right. That’s why I feel
we’ve arrived at this moment before, and it might disappear
back into space-time. Then we'll have to wait billions of years
to get here again, which is so dull. 17:03So let's not fuck it up. 17:05(Laughter) 17:06(Applause) 17:10HW: I've got another question. I just wanted to have
a moment of eye to eye. Don't fuck it up. Don't fuck it up. OK. 17:17JW: That’s the message.
The whole TED Talk is: “Don’t fuck it up.” 17:20HW: But wait, I have another question. 17:22JW: I could have saved
12 minutes, 55 seconds. 17:26HW: Yeah, well, I'll just be
the title that we put online. 17:29Jeanette Winterson: “Don’t fuck it up.” 17:31OK. I want to talk about love. So in your memoir,
which everybody should read, it is called “Why Be Happy
When You Can Be Normal?” The very end of that book is about -- it’s a good title -- t’s about love. And you write, ""Love, the difficult word. Where everything starts,
where we always return. Love. Love's lack.
The possibility of love."" Now I don't want
to bastardize Ada Lovelace. She was all about originating. But what about love? What about alternative
intelligence and love? 18:01JW: We'll teach it. 18:03HW: We’ll teach it? JW: Yeah. And listen, any of you who ever
fell in love with your teddy bear, which is all of you, know what it's like to have an intense relationship
with a nonbiological lifeform. 18:13(Laughter) 18:15HW: Jeanette Winterson, I love you. 18:18JW: Thank you.
HW: Thank you so much. Thank you."
1,AI-generated creatures that stretch the boundaries of imagination,Sofia Crespo,Nov 2022,"Can AI help us see beyond our human capabilities? Through a kaleidoscopic blend of technology, nature and art, neural artist Sofia Crespo brings to life animals that push the boundaries of creativity and imagination. Her artistic renditions of chimeras combine images of real-world endangered species to create something totally new -- with the intention of inspiring real-world conservation. Witness a speculative study of creatures that never existed, brought to life by AI.", (2.1K),"Transcript (2 Languages)English中文 (简体)00:01I'd like to start by asking
you to imagine a color that you've never seen before. Just for a second give this a try. 00:11Can you actually visualize a color
that you've never been able to perceive? I never seem to get tired of trying this although I know
it's not an easy challenge. And the thing is, we can't imagine something
without drawing upon our experiences. A color we haven't yet seen outside the spectrum we can perceive is outside our ability to conjure up. It's almost like there's a boundary
to our imagination where all the colors we can imagine can only be various shades of other colors
we have previously seen. Yet we know for a fact that those color frequencies
outside our visible spectrum are there. And scientists believe
that there are species that have many more photo receptors than just the three color ones
we humans have. 01:10Which, by the way, not all humans see the world
in the same way. Some of us are colorblind
to various degrees, and very often we don't even
agree on small things, like if a dress on the internet
is blue and black or white and gold. But my favorite creature,
one of my favorite creatures, is the peacock mantis shrimp, which is estimated to have 12
to 16 photo receptors. And that indicates the world to them
might look so much more colorful. 01:50So what about artificial intelligence? Can AI help us see
beyond our human capabilities? 01:59Well, I've been working with AI
for the past five years, and in my experience, it can see
within the data it gets fed. But then you might be wondering, OK, if AI can't help imagine anything new, why would an artist see
any point in using it? And my answer to that is because I think
that it can help augment our creativity as there's value in creating combinations
of known elements to form new ones. And this boundary of what we can imagine
based on what we have experienced is the place that I have been exploring. 02:38For me, it started with jellyfish
on a screen at an aquarium and wearing those old 3D glasses,
which I hope you remember, the ones with the blue and red lens. And this experience made me want
to recreate their textures. But not just that, I also wanted to create new jellyfish that I hadn't seen before, like these. And what started with jellyfish, very quickly escalated
to other sea creatures like sea anemone, coral and fish. And then from there came amphibians,
birds and insects. And this became a series
called “Neural Zoo”. 03:22But when you look closely,
what do you see? There's no single creature
in these images. And AI augments my creative process by allowing me to distill
and recombine textures. And that's something that would otherwise
take me months to draw by hand. Plus I'm actually terrible at drawing. 03:45So you could say, in a way, what I'm doing is a contemporary version of something that humans have already
been doing for a long time, even before cameras existed. In medieval times, people went on expeditions, and when they came back
they would share about what they saw to an illustrator. And the illustrator, having never seen
what was being described, would end up drawing based on the creatures
that they had previously seen and in the process creating
hybrid animals of some sort. So an explorer might describe a beaver,
but having never seen one, the illustrator might give it
the head of a rodent, the body of a dog and a fish-like tail. In the series
“Artificial Natural History”, I took thousands of illustrations
from a natural history archives, and I fed them to a neural network
to generate new versions of them. But up until now,
all my work was done in 2D. And with the help of my studio partner,
Feileacan McCormick, we decided to train a neural network
on a data set of 3D scanned beetles. But I must warn you that our first
results were extremely blurry, and they looked
like the blobs you see here. And this could be due to many reasons, but one of them being
that there aren't really a lot of openly available
data sets of 3D insects. And also we were repurposing a neural network that normally gets used
to generate images to generate 3D. So believe it or not,
these are very exciting blobs to us. 05:26But with time and some
very hacky solutions like data augmentation, where we threw in ants
and other beetle-like insects to enhance the data set, we ended up getting this, which we've been told
they look like grilled chicken. 05:44(Laughter) 05:45But hungry for more,
we pushed our technique, and eventually they ended up
looking like this. We use something called 3D style transfer
to map textures onto them, and we also trained
a natural language model to generate scientific-like names and anatomical descriptions. And eventually we even found a network
architecture that could handle 3D meshes. So they ended up looking like this. And for us, this became a way
of creating kind of a speculative study -- 06:23(Applause) 06:25A speculative study of creatures
that never existed, kind of like a speculative biology. 06:34But I didn't want to talk
about AI and its potential unless it brought me closer
to a real species. Which of these do you think is easier
to find data about online? 06:47(Laughter) 06:49Yeah, well, as you guessed
correctly, the red panda. And this maybe could be
due to many reasons, but one of them being how cute they are, which means we photograph
and talk about them a lot, unlike the boreal felt lichen. But both of them
are classified as endangered. So I wanted to bring visibility
to other endangered species that don't get the same amount
of digital representation as a cute, fluffy red panda. And to do this, we trained an AI on millions of images
of the natural world, and then we prompted with text to generate some of these creatures. 07:36So when prompted with a text, ""an image of a critically endangered
spider, the peacock tarantula"" and its scientific name, our model generated this. And here's an image
of the real peacock tarantula, which is a wonderful spider
endemic to India. But when prompted with a text ""an image of a critically
endangered bird, the mangrove finch,"" our model generated this. And here's a photo
of the real mangrove finch. Both these creatures exist in the wild, but the accuracy of each generated image
is fully dependent on the data available. These chimeras of our everyday data to me are a different way
of how the future could be. Not in a literal sense, perhaps, but in the sense that through practicing
the expanding of our own imagination about the ecosystems we are a part of, we might just be better equipped
to recognize new opportunities and potential. 08:48Knowing that there's a boundary
to our imagination doesn't have to feel limiting. On the contrary, it can help motivate us
to expand that boundary further and to seek out colors
and things we haven't yet seen and perhaps enrich
our imagination as a result. 09:07So thank you. 09:08(Applause)"

Ali Kashani introduces us to Postmates' autonomous delivery robot and explains how it could help reduce carbon emissions and free up valuable real estate in cities everywhere. Learn more about how it was specially designed to navigate complex social interactions on busy sidewalks to bring you your food (and more) with joy., (57K),"Transcript (21 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsO'zbekPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01footnotefootnoteFood delivery. It's the thing that saves
millennials from starvation. By my calculations, Americans order over 20 million
restaurant deliveries every single day. Over half of these deliveries
are actually within walking distance. But nine out of 10 are delivered in cars. So basically, we are moving a two-pound burrito in a two-ton car 20 million times a day. The energy to bring you that burrito is actually bringing you
a two-ton metal cage with heated seats. 00:36Let's be honest. We are addicted to our cars. Did you know that in America, for every car,
there are four parking spots? In some downtowns, over half of the real estate is for cars. We have designed our cities
around our cars, because we drive
whether we're going two miles or 200 miles. Solo, or with our whole family. We get into the same SUV
to go buy coffee or a coffee table. If we could free up
some of these streets and parking lots, we could build more housing, more social spaces, more parks. But to do that, first, we need to rethink
how we are using cars today. 01:17In the city of the future, if you want to go five blocks,
you summon a bike or a scooter. If you're in a rush,
a passenger drone would pick you up. And if you need food,
no need to have someone drive over -- the food will make its way to you. 01:32footnotefootnoteLet's go back to those 20 million a day
restaurant deliveries. If we could get
these deliveries off the road, we could reduce the need for as many as one and a half
million cars just in the US. That's twice the size of San Francisco. Now, think of the impact this could have
on cities like Delhi, or my birth city of Tehran, where car pollution is killing
thousands of people every year. 01:58So how do we get some
of these deliveries off the road? Well, that's the question that my team and I have been obsessed with
over the last three years. And the solution is
actually one of the building blocks of the city of the future. We've been creating
small, self-driving robots that navigate quiet alleys and sidewalks on a walking pace and have a secured cargo
to deliver you food and supplies. 02:28Now, before I tell you
more about the robots, let's do a quick thought experiment. In your mind, picture a city
with thousands of robots. Is it this one? This Hollywood dystopia
is what a lot of people expect. But our job is to create a friendly future
that's designed for people. So instead of making aliens, we set out to create robots
that are familiar. Robots that would belong
in our communities. But we also wanted a little surprise. Something unexpectedly delightful. 03:05Think about it. You're walking down the street, and you see your very first robot. That's the moment
when you're going to decide if this is a future you love or fear. And with a lot of people
having these dystopian ideas, we need to open their minds. We want to surprise and delight them, so that we can win them over
on first impression. This is what we came up with. It's familiar, but it's also surprising. It's just a shopping cart, but it also looks like
we crossbred WALL-E with Minions. If you live in San Francisco
or Los Angeles, chances are one of these
has already delivered your food. 03:45As soon as we put robots
out on the street, we learned some
really interesting problems. Like, how should robots cross the road? Or how should robots interact with people
with visual or mobility impairments? We quickly realized
that we need to teach our robots how to communicate with people. People on the sidewalk
come from every walk of life, so we needed to create a new language, kind of a universal language so people and robots
can understand each other right off the bat. Because no one is going
to be reading user manuals. 04:23footnotefootnoteWe started with eyes,
because eyes are universal. They can show where the robot is going or if it's confused. Plus, eyes make robots more human. We also used sounds. For example, we created this running sound with frequent gaps so that people with visual impairments
could locate their robots using the Doppler effect. 04:47But it turned out these were not enough. At intersections, cars would cut in front of our robots. Drivers were getting confused sometimes, because robots would take too long
before they started crossing. Even ordinary pedestrians
were getting confused. Sometimes, they couldn't figure out
on which side to pass the robots, because robots make a lot
of small adjustments to their direction as they move. This actually sparked a new idea. What if we used movement
to create a universal language? Like, at intersections, robots would gently move forward
before they start crossing, to signal to drivers that it's their turn. If they see someone in a wheelchair, they yield by pointing themselves
away from the sidewalk, to signal that they're not going to move. 05:37footnotefootnoteSome of you may remember this. In 2015, Canadian researchers
sent a robot hitchhiking across the US. It didn't get very far. It turns out that robots
can also use some social skills. Like, if they're being tampered with, Carnegie Mellon researchers have shown
that small toy robots should play dead, because people feel bad
when they think they broke it. But delivery robots aren't toys, they're not small,
they are out there in public. We found that with delivery robots, to get people to stop tampering, robots need to show awareness. It's kind of the opposite of playing dead. In this case, robots need to acknowledge the situation to get people to step away. Also, a word of advice. If you are a robot and you see small kids, run towards the closest adult. It turns out that some kids
just love harassing robots. 06:35So besides dystopia, Hollywood also promised us
some really cool robots that would run our errands
or keep us company. So far, we've really focused
on food delivery, but in the future, these robots can do more. Like, they could gather excess food
and bring it to shelters every night. Because in America,
we waste 30 percent of our food, while 10 percent of our people
experience food insecurity. These robots could be
part of the solution. 07:06Or when we have hundreds of robots
running around cities, we could have robots carry
emergency medications at all times, just in case someone nearby
has an allergic reaction or an asthma attack. These robots could be on-site
within a minute or two, faster than anyone else. And during pandemics, robots can be a key part
of our infrastructure. They can ensure that we can provide our communities
with the essential needs even during emergencies. 07:35Let me leave you with one last thought. Today, objects can't get from A to B
without human help, because our three-dimensional world
is quite complex. But new sensors and AI can change that. In a way, technology is like a baby that has just learned to recognize objects
and understand words, and maybe even hold a basic conversation, but it hasn't learned to walk yet. Now, we are teaching technology how to navigate
the three-dimensional world without our help. We are entering this new era where insentient objects
are going to get up and move freely. And when they do, we've got to make sure
they don't look like aliens. 08:24My vision for the future
is that when things come to life, they do so with joy. You know, less like
the movie ""Terminator"" and more like ""Toy Story."" 08:36Thank you."
1,The ethical dilemma of self-driving cars,Patrick Lin,Dec 2015,"Self-driving cars are already cruising the streets today. And while these cars will ultimately be safer and cleaner than their manual counterparts, they can't completely avoid accidents altogether.

in the not so distant future, you're barreling down the highway
in your self-driving car, and you find yourself boxed in
on all sides by other cars. Suddenly, a large, heavy object
falls off the truck in front of you. Your car can't stop in time
to avoid the collision, so it needs to make a decision: go straight and hit the object, swerve left into an SUV, or swerve right into a motorcycle. Should it prioritize your safety
by hitting the motorcycle, minimize danger to others by not swerving, even if it means hitting the large object
and sacrificing your life, or take the middle ground
by hitting the SUV, which has a high passenger safety rating? So what should the self-driving car do? 00:56If we were driving that boxed in car
in manual mode, whichever way we'd react
would be understood as just that, a reaction, not a deliberate decision. It would be an instinctual panicked move
with no forethought or malice. But if a programmer were to instruct
the car to make the same move, given conditions it may 
sense in the future, well, that looks more
like premeditated homicide. 01:21Now, to be fair, self-driving cars are predicted 
to dramatically reduce traffic accidents and fatalities by removing human error 
from the driving equation. Plus, there may be all sorts 
of other benefits: eased road congestion, decreased harmful emissions, and minimized unproductive
and stressful driving time. But accidents can and will still happen, and when they do, their outcomes may be determined
months or years in advance by programmers or policy makers. And they'll have 
some difficult decisions to make. It's tempting to offer up general 
decision-making principles, like minimize harm, but even that quickly leads 
to morally murky decisions. 02:02For example, let's say we have the same initial set up, but now there's a motorcyclist 
wearing a helmet to your left and another one without 
a helmet to your right. Which one should 
your robot car crash into? If you say the biker with the helmet
because she's more likely to survive, then aren't you penalizing 
the responsible motorist? If, instead, you save the biker 
without the helmet because he's acting irresponsibly, then you've gone way beyond the initial
design principle about minimizing harm, and the robot car is now 
meting out street justice. 02:34The ethical considerations 
get more complicated here. In both of our scenarios, the underlying design is functioning
as a targeting algorithm of sorts. In other words, it's systematically favoring 
or discriminating against a certain type 
of object to crash into. And the owners of the target vehicles will suffer the negative consequences
of this algorithm through no fault of their own. 02:58Our new technologies are opening up
many other novel ethical dilemmas. For instance, if you had to 
choose between a car that would always save
as many lives as possible in an accident, or one that would save you at any cost, which would you buy? What happens if the cars start analyzing
and factoring in the passengers of the cars
and the particulars of their lives? Could it be the case 
that a random decision is still better than a predetermined one
designed to minimize harm? And who should be making 
all of these decisions anyhow? Programmers? Companies?
Governments? 03:34Reality may not play out exactly
like our thought experiments, but that's not the point. They're designed to isolate 
and stress test our intuitions on ethics, just like science experiments do
for the physical world. Spotting these moral hairpin turns now will help us maneuver the unfamiliar road
of technology ethics, and allow us to cruise confidently
and conscientiously into our brave new future."

car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time. 00:18What happens next? 00:20Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. 00:45That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR, and a miniature version of 
the communications technology that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics. 01:00To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features? 01:42LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile. 02:13The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly. 02:33That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large; in other places, they completely 
cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar. It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better 
 than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street. 03:57The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds. 04:27By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed: a steerable laser beam. 04:47From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number 
of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose."

I'm a media artist. I use data as a pigment and paint with a thinking brush that is assisted
by artificial intelligence. Using architectural spaces as canvases, I collaborate with machines to make buildings dream and hallucinate. You may be wondering,
what does all this mean? So let me please take you
into my work and my world. 00:25I witnessed the power of imagination
when I was eight years old, as a child growing up in Istanbul. One day, my mom brought home
a videocassette of the science-fiction movie
""Blade Runner."" I clearly remember being mesmerized by the stunning architectural vision
of the future of Los Angeles, a place that I had never seen before. That vision became
a kind of a staple of my daydreams. 00:54When I arrived in LA in 2012 for a graduate program
in Design Media Arts, I rented a car and drove downtown to see that wonderful world
of the near future. I remember a specific line that kept playing
over and over in my head: the scene when the android Rachael realizes that her memories
are actually not hers, and when Deckard tells her
they are someone else's memories. Since that moment, one of my inspirations
has been this question. What can a machine do
with someone else's memories? Or, to say that in another way, what does it mean to be an AI
in the 21st century? 01:37Any android or AI machine is only intelligent
as long as we collaborate with it. It can construct things that human intelligence intends to produce but does not have the capacity to do so. Think about your activities
and social networks, for example. They get smarter
the more you interact with them. If machines can learn or process memories, can they also dream? Hallucinate? Involuntarily remember, or make connections
between multiple people's dreams? Does being an AI in the 21st century
simply mean not forgetting anything? And, if so, isn't it the most revolutionary thing
that we have experienced in our centuries-long effort
to capture history across media? In other words, how far have we come
since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner""? 02:36So I established my studio in 2014 and invited architects, computer and data scientists,
neuroscientists, musicians and even storytellers to join me in realizing my dreams. Can data become a pigment? This was the very first question we asked when starting our journey
to embed media arts into architecture, to collide virtual and physical worlds. So we began to imagine
what I would call the poetics of data. 03:10One of our first projects,
""Virtual Depictions,"" was a public data sculpture piece commissioned by the city of San Francisco. The work invites the audience to be part of a spectacular
aesthetic experience in a living urban space by depicting a fluid network
of connections of the city itself. It also stands as a reminder of how invisible data
from our everyday lives, like the Twitter feeds
that are represented here, can be made visible and transformed into sensory knowledge
that can be experienced collectively. 03:48In fact, data can only become knowledge
when it's experienced, and what is knowledge and experience
can take many forms. When exploring such connections through the vast potential
of machine intelligence, we also pondered the connection
between human senses and the machines' capacity
for simulating nature. 04:12These inquiries began
while working on wind-data paintings. They took the shape of visualized poems based on hidden data sets
that we collected from wind sensors. We then used generative algorithms to transform wind speed,
gust and direction into an ethereal data pigment. The result was a meditative
yet speculative experience. This kinetic data sculpture,
titled ""Bosphorus,"" was a similar attempt to question
our capacity to reimagine natural occurrences. Using high-frequency radar collections
of the Marmara Sea, we collected sea-surface data and projected its dynamic movement
with machine intelligence. We create a sense of immersion in a calm yet constantly changing
synthetic sea view. 05:09Seeing with the brain
is often called imagination, and, for me, imagining architecture goes beyond just glass, metal or concrete, instead experimenting with
the furthermost possibilities of immersion and ways of augmenting
our perception in built environments. 05:28Research in artificial intelligence
is growing every day, leaving us with the feeling
of being plugged into a system that is bigger and more knowledgeable than ourselves. 05:39In 2017, we discovered
an open-source library of cultural documents in Istanbul and began working on ""Archive Dreaming,"" one of the first AI-driven
public installations in the world, an AI exploring approximately
1.7 million documents that span 270 years. One of our inspirations
during this process was a short story
called ""The Library of Babel"" by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In the story, the author conceives
a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books
of a certain format and character set. Through this inspiring image, we imagine a way to physically explore
the vast archives of knowledge in the age of machine intelligence. The resulting work, as you can see, was a user-driven immersive space. ""Archive Dreaming"" profoundly transformed
the experience of a library in the age of machine intelligence. 06:44""Machine Hallucination""
is an exploration of time and space experienced through New York City's
public photographic archives. For this one-of-a-kind immersive project, we deployed machine-learning algorithms to find and process over
100 million photographs of the city. We designed an innovative narrative system to use artificial intelligence
to predict or to hallucinate new images, allowing the viewer
to step into a dreamlike fusion of past and future New York. 07:19As our projects delve deeper into remembering
and transmitting knowledge, we thought more about how memories
were not static recollections but ever-changing
interpretations of past events. We pondered how machines could simulate unconscious
and subconscious events, such as dreaming,
remembering and hallucinating. Thus, we created ""Melting Memories"" to visualize the moment of remembering. 07:51The inspiration came from a tragic event, when I found out that my uncle
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. At that time, all I could think about was to find a way to celebrate
how and what we remember when we are still able to do so. I began to think of memories
not as disappearing but as melting or changing shape. With the help of machine intelligence, we worked with the scientists
at the Neuroscape Laboratory at the University of California, who showed us how to understand
brain signals as memories are made. Although my own uncle was losing
the ability to process memories, the artwork generated by EEG data explored the materiality of remembering and stood as a tribute
to what my uncle had lost. 08:48Almost nothing about contemporary LA matched my childhood
expectation of the city, with the exception
of one amazing building: the Walt Disney Concert Hall,
designed by Frank Gehry, one of my all-time heroes. In 2018, I had a call
from the LA Philharmonic who was looking for an installation to help mark the celebrated symphony's
hundred-year anniversary. For this, we decided to ask the question, ""Can a building learn? Can it dream?"" To answer this question, we decided to collect everything recorded
in the archives of the LA Phil and WDCH. To be precise, 77 terabytes
of digitally archived memories. By using machine intelligence, the entire archive, going back 100 years, became projections on the building's skin, 42 projectors to achieve
this futuristic public experience in the heart of Los Angeles, getting one step closer
to the LA of ""Blade Runner."" If ever a building could dream, it was in this moment. 09:59Now, I am inviting you to one last journey
into the mind of a machine. Right now, we are fully immersed
in the data universe of every single curated TED Talk
from the past 30 years. That means this data set includes
7,705 talks from the TED stage. Those talks have been translated
into 7.4 million seconds, and each second is represented
here in this data universe. Every image that you are seeing in here represents unique moments
from those talks. By using machine intelligence, we processed a total of 487,000 sentences into 330 unique clusters of topics
like nature, global emissions, extinction, race issues, computation, trust, emotions, water and refugees. These clusters are then
connected to each other by an algorithm, [that] generated 113 million
line segments, which reveal new conceptual relationships. Wouldn't it be amazing
to be able to remember all the questions that have ever
been asked on the stage? 11:11Here I am, inside the mind
of countless great thinkers, as well as a machine,
interacting with various feelings attributed to learning, remembering, questioning and imagining all at the same time, expanding the power of the mind. 11:31For me, being right here is indeed what it means
to be an AI in the 21st century. It is in our hands, humans, to train this mind to learn and remember what we can only dream of. 11:47Thank you."
1,A new way to restore Earth's biodiversity — from the air,Susan Graham,Sep 2021,"Land restoration is about more than planting trees, says environmentalist Susan Graham. Check out how her team combines drone technology with ecology-trained AI to restore degraded land and revive complex, biodiverse ecosystems -- whether it's on a small island or across an entire continent.", (17K),"Transcript (33 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoItalianoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیहिन्दीதமிழ்ಕನ್ನಡසිංහලမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Every year, humans change
10 million hectares of land, and not for the better. Right now, there are more than two billion
hectares of degraded land around the world. We need to fix this fast,
and technology can help. Restoration is an enormous,
complex challenge. It cannot be done
by simply planting trees. We need to bring native,
complex ecosystems back to life, and it requires deep ecological expertise. Until now, we have been limited
to poor facsimiles, like vast plantations
of a single kind of tree. But drones change that
by allowing us to gather data and plant the right mix of vegetation
quickly, at enormous scales. And machine-learning analysis
enables us to plan the planting and then monitor our restoration work. 00:49For example, in Australia, we're using drone-based planting
and ecology-trained AI to restore thousands of hectares
of land mined for coal. Not just planting trees, but bringing back biodiverse,
complex ecosystems. On a larger scale,
native forests here in Australia have been decimated
by catastrophic bushfires and land-clearing for agriculture. This means diminished food sources
and safe habitats for koalas. A new project would allow us to accelerate the restoration of thousands
of hectares of koala forests over the next few years. 01:28With these combined technologies, we're able to scale up restoration from a small island
to an entire continent. We can return forests to land
where a mine used to be, or recreate ecosystems like the one we're hoping to restore
on Lord Howe Island, birthplace of one of the world's
largest insects. This unique island
is plagued by imported species, where we're helping to eradicate
the undesirable plants to allow endemic species to thrive. 01:59It's not just billions of trees. It's restoring nature
in all its complexity and beauty. 02:06Thank you."
1,Can we build AI without losing control over it?,Sam Harris,Sep 2016,"Scared of superintelligent AI? You should be, says neuroscientist and philosopher Sam Harris -- and not just in some theoretical way.

about a failure of intuition that many of us suffer from. It's really a failure
to detect a certain kind of danger. I'm going to describe a scenario that I think is both terrifying and likely to occur, and that's not a good combination, as it turns out. And yet rather than be scared,
most of you will feel that what I'm talking about
is kind of cool. 00:25I'm going to describe
how the gains we make in artificial intelligence could ultimately destroy us. And in fact, I think it's very difficult
to see how they won't destroy us or inspire us to destroy ourselves. And yet if you're anything like me, you'll find that it's fun
to think about these things. And that response is part of the problem. OK? That response should worry you. And if I were to convince you in this talk that we were likely
to suffer a global famine, either because of climate change
or some other catastrophe, and that your grandchildren,
or their grandchildren, are very likely to live like this, you wouldn't think, ""Interesting. I like this TED Talk."" 01:09Famine isn't fun. Death by science fiction,
on the other hand, is fun, and one of the things that worries me most
about the development of AI at this point is that we seem unable to marshal
an appropriate emotional response to the dangers that lie ahead. I am unable to marshal this response,
and I'm giving this talk. 01:30It's as though we stand before two doors. Behind door number one, we stop making progress
in building intelligent machines. Our computer hardware and software
just stops getting better for some reason. Now take a moment
to consider why this might happen. I mean, given how valuable
intelligence and automation are, we will continue to improve our technology
if we are at all able to. What could stop us from doing this? A full-scale nuclear war? A global pandemic? An asteroid impact? Justin Bieber becoming
president of the United States? 02:08(Laughter) 02:12The point is, something would have to
destroy civilization as we know it. You have to imagine
how bad it would have to be to prevent us from making
improvements in our technology permanently, generation after generation. Almost by definition,
this is the worst thing that's ever happened in human history. 02:32So the only alternative, and this is what lies
behind door number two, is that we continue
to improve our intelligent machines year after year after year. At a certain point, we will build
machines that are smarter than we are, and once we have machines
that are smarter than we are, they will begin to improve themselves. And then we risk what
the mathematician IJ Good called an ""intelligence explosion,"" that the process could get away from us. 02:58Now, this is often caricatured,
as I have here, as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us. But that isn't the most likely scenario. It's not that our machines
will become spontaneously malevolent. The concern is really
that we will build machines that are so much
more competent than we are that the slightest divergence
between their goals and our own could destroy us. 03:23Just think about how we relate to ants. We don't hate them. We don't go out of our way to harm them. In fact, sometimes
we take pains not to harm them. We step over them on the sidewalk. But whenever their presence seriously conflicts with one of our goals, let's say when constructing
a building like this one, we annihilate them without a qualm. The concern is that we will
one day build machines that, whether they're conscious or not, could treat us with similar disregard. 03:53Now, I suspect this seems
far-fetched to many of you. I bet there are those of you who doubt
that superintelligent AI is possible, much less inevitable. But then you must find something wrong
with one of the following assumptions. And there are only three of them. 04:11Intelligence is a matter of information
processing in physical systems. Actually, this is a little bit more
than an assumption. We have already built
narrow intelligence into our machines, and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman
intelligence already. And we know that mere matter can give rise to what is called
""general intelligence,"" an ability to think flexibly
across multiple domains, because our brains have managed it. Right? I mean, there's just atoms in here, and as long as we continue
to build systems of atoms that display more and more
intelligent behavior, we will eventually,
unless we are interrupted, we will eventually
build general intelligence into our machines. 04:59It's crucial to realize
that the rate of progress doesn't matter, because any progress
is enough to get us into the end zone. We don't need Moore's law to continue.
We don't need exponential progress. We just need to keep going. 05:13The second assumption
is that we will keep going. We will continue to improve
our intelligent machines. And given the value of intelligence -- I mean, intelligence is either
the source of everything we value or we need it to safeguard
everything we value. It is our most valuable resource. So we want to do this. We have problems
that we desperately need to solve. We want to cure diseases
like Alzheimer's and cancer. We want to understand economic systems.
We want to improve our climate science. So we will do this, if we can. The train is already out of the station,
and there's no brake to pull. 05:53Finally, we don't stand
on a peak of intelligence, or anywhere near it, likely. And this really is the crucial insight. This is what makes
our situation so precarious, and this is what makes our intuitions
about risk so unreliable. 06:11Now, just consider the smartest person
who has ever lived. On almost everyone's shortlist here
is John von Neumann. I mean, the impression that von Neumann
made on the people around him, and this included the greatest
mathematicians and physicists of his time, is fairly well-documented. If only half the stories
about him are half true, there's no question he's one of the smartest people
who has ever lived. So consider the spectrum of intelligence. Here we have John von Neumann. And then we have you and me. And then we have a chicken. 06:45(Laughter) 06:47Sorry, a chicken. 06:48(Laughter) 06:49There's no reason for me to make this talk
more depressing than it needs to be. 06:53(Laughter) 06:56It seems overwhelmingly likely, however,
that the spectrum of intelligence extends much further
than we currently conceive, and if we build machines
that are more intelligent than we are, they will very likely
explore this spectrum in ways that we can't imagine, and exceed us in ways
that we can't imagine. 07:15And it's important to recognize that
this is true by virtue of speed alone. Right? So imagine if we just built
a superintelligent AI that was no smarter
than your average team of researchers at Stanford or MIT. Well, electronic circuits
function about a million times faster than biochemical ones, so this machine should think
about a million times faster than the minds that built it. So you set it running for a week, and it will perform 20,000 years
of human-level intellectual work, week after week after week. How could we even understand,
much less constrain, a mind making this sort of progress? 07:56The other thing that's worrying, frankly, is that, imagine the best case scenario. So imagine we hit upon a design
of superintelligent AI that has no safety concerns. We have the perfect design
the first time around. It's as though we've been handed an oracle that behaves exactly as intended. Well, this machine would be
the perfect labor-saving device. It can design the machine
that can build the machine that can do any physical work, powered by sunlight, more or less for the cost
of raw materials. So we're talking about
the end of human drudgery. We're also talking about the end
of most intellectual work. 08:37So what would apes like ourselves
do in this circumstance? Well, we'd be free to play Frisbee
and give each other massages. Add some LSD and some
questionable wardrobe choices, and the whole world
could be like Burning Man. 08:50(Laughter) 08:54Now, that might sound pretty good, but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic
and political order? It seems likely that we would witness a level of wealth inequality
and unemployment that we have never seen before. Absent a willingness
to immediately put this new wealth to the service of all humanity, a few trillionaires could grace
the covers of our business magazines while the rest of the world
would be free to starve. 09:22And what would the Russians
or the Chinese do if they heard that some company
in Silicon Valley was about to deploy a superintelligent AI? This machine would be capable
of waging war, whether terrestrial or cyber, with unprecedented power. This is a winner-take-all scenario. To be six months ahead
of the competition here is to be 500,000 years ahead, at a minimum. So it seems that even mere rumors
of this kind of breakthrough could cause our species to go berserk. 09:54Now, one of the most frightening things, in my view, at this moment, are the kinds of things
that AI researchers say when they want to be reassuring. And the most common reason
we're told not to worry is time. This is all a long way off,
don't you know. This is probably 50 or 100 years away. One researcher has said, ""Worrying about AI safety is like worrying
about overpopulation on Mars."" This is the Silicon Valley version of ""don't worry your
pretty little head about it."" 10:26(Laughter) 10:27No one seems to notice that referencing the time horizon is a total non sequitur. If intelligence is just a matter
of information processing, and we continue to improve our machines, we will produce
some form of superintelligence. And we have no idea
how long it will take us to create the conditions
to do that safely. Let me say that again. We have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions
to do that safely. 11:00And if you haven't noticed,
50 years is not what it used to be. This is 50 years in months. This is how long we've had the iPhone. This is how long ""The Simpsons""
has been on television. Fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges
our species will ever face. Once again, we seem to be failing
to have an appropriate emotional response to what we have every reason
to believe is coming. 11:26The computer scientist Stuart Russell
has a nice analogy here. He said, imagine that we received
a message from an alien civilization, which read: ""People of Earth, we will arrive on your planet in 50 years. Get ready."" And now we're just counting down
the months until the mothership lands? We would feel a little
more urgency than we do. 11:52Another reason we're told not to worry is that these machines
can't help but share our values because they will be literally
extensions of ourselves. They'll be grafted onto our brains, and we'll essentially
become their limbic systems. Now take a moment to consider that the safest
and only prudent path forward, recommended, is to implant this technology
directly into our brains. Now, this may in fact be the safest
and only prudent path forward, but usually one's safety concerns
about a technology have to be pretty much worked out
before you stick it inside your head. 12:24(Laughter) 12:26The deeper problem is that
building superintelligent AI on its own seems likely to be easier than building superintelligent AI and having the completed neuroscience that allows us to seamlessly
integrate our minds with it. And given that the companies
and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves
as being in a race against all others, given that to win this race
is to win the world, provided you don't destroy it
in the next moment, then it seems likely
that whatever is easier to do will get done first. 12:58Now, unfortunately,
I don't have a solution to this problem, apart from recommending
that more of us think about it. I think we need something
like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence. Not to build it, because I think
we'll inevitably do that, but to understand
how to avoid an arms race and to build it in a way
that is aligned with our interests. When you're talking
about superintelligent AI that can make changes to itself, it seems that we only have one chance
to get the initial conditions right, and even then we will need to absorb the economic and political
consequences of getting them right. 13:33But the moment we admit that information processing
is the source of intelligence, that some appropriate computational system
is what the basis of intelligence is, and we admit that we will improve
these systems continuously, and we admit that the horizon
of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know, then we have to admit that we are in the process
of building some sort of god. Now would be a good time to make sure it's a god we can live with. 14:08Thank you very much. 14:09(Applause)"
1,A bold idea to replace politicians,César Hidalgo,Mar 2019,"César Hidalgo has a radical suggestion for fixing our broken political system: automate it! In this provocative talk, he outlines a bold idea to bypass politicians by empowering citizens to create personalized AI representatives that participate directly in democratic decisions. Explore a new way to make collective decisions and expand your understanding of democracy.", (66K),"Transcript (19 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01Is it just me, or are there other people here that are a little bit
disappointed with democracy? 00:08(Applause) 00:12So let's look at a few numbers. If we look across the world, the median turnout
in presidential elections over the last 30 years has been just 67 percent. Now, if we go to Europe and we look at people that participated
in EU parliamentary elections, the median turnout in those elections is just 42 percent. Now let's go to New York, and let's see how many people voted
in the last election for mayor. We will find that only
24 percent of people showed up to vote. What that means is that,
if ""Friends"" was still running, Joey and maybe Phoebe
would have shown up to vote. 00:55(Laughter) 00:57And you cannot blame them
because people are tired of politicians. And people are tired of other people
using the data that they have generated to communicate with
their friends and family, to target political propaganda at them. But the thing about this
is that this is not new. Nowadays, people use likes
to target propaganda at you before they use your zip code
or your gender or your age, because the idea of targeting people
with propaganda for political purposes is as old as politics. And the reason why that idea is there is because democracy
has a basic vulnerability. This is the idea of a representative. 01:34In principle, democracy is the ability
of people to exert power. But in practice, we have to delegate
that power to a representative that can exert that power for us. That representative is a bottleneck, or a weak spot. It is the place that you want to target
if you want to attack democracy because you can capture democracy
by either capturing that representative or capturing the way
that people choose it. So the big question is: Is this the end of history? Is this the best that we can do or, actually, are there alternatives? 02:10Some people have been thinking
about alternatives, and one of the ideas that is out there
is the idea of direct democracy. This is the idea of bypassing
politicians completely and having people vote directly on issues, having people vote directly on bills. But this idea is naive because there's too many things
that we would need to choose. If you look at the 114th US Congress, you will have seen that
the House of Representatives considered more than 6,000 bills, the Senate considered
more than 3,000 bills and they approved more than 300 laws. Those would be many decisions that each person would have to make a week on topics that they know little about. So there's a big cognitive
bandwidth problem if we're going to try to think about
direct democracy as a viable alternative. 02:56So some people think about the idea
of liquid democracy, or fluid democracy, which is the idea that you endorse
your political power to someone, who can endorse it to someone else, and, eventually, you create
a large follower network in which, at the end, there's a few people
that are making decisions on behalf of all of their followers
and their followers. But this idea also doesn't solve
the problem of the cognitive bandwidth and, to be honest, it's also quite similar
to the idea of having a representative. So what I'm going to do today is
I'm going to be a little bit provocative, and I'm going to ask you, well: What if, instead of trying
to bypass politicians, we tried to automate them? 03:45The idea of automation is not new. It was started more than 300 years ago, when French weavers decided
to automate the loom. The winner of that industrial war
was Joseph-Marie Jacquard. He was a French weaver and merchant that married the loom
with the steam engine to create autonomous looms. And in those autonomous looms,
he gained control. He could now make fabrics that were
more complex and more sophisticated than the ones they
were able to do by hand. But also, by winning that industrial war, he laid out what has become
the blueprint of automation. 04:22The way that we automate things
for the last 300 years has always been the same: we first identify a need, then we create a tool
to satisfy that need, like the loom, in this case, and then we study how people use that tool to automate that user. That's how we came
from the mechanical loom to the autonomous loom, and that took us a thousand years. Now, it's taken us only a hundred years to use the same script
to automate the car. But the thing is that, this time around, automation is kind of for real. 04:57This is a video that a colleague of mine
from Toshiba shared with me that shows the factory
that manufactures solid state drives. The entire factory is a robot. There are no humans in that factory. And the robots are soon
to leave the factories and become part of our world, become part of our workforce. So what I do in my day job is actually create tools that integrate
data for entire countries so that we can ultimately have
the foundations that we need for a future in which we need
to also manage those machines. 05:29But today, I'm not here
to talk to you about these tools that integrate data for countries. But I'm here to talk to you
about another idea that might help us think about how to use
artificial intelligence in democracy. Because the tools that I build
are designed for executive decisions. These are decisions that can be cast
in some sort of term of objectivity -- public investment decisions. But there are decisions
that are legislative, and these decisions that are legislative
require communication among people that have different points of view, require participation, require debate, require deliberation. And for a long time,
we have thought that, well, what we need to improve democracy
is actually more communication. So all of the technologies that we have
advanced in the context of democracy, whether they are newspapers
or whether it is social media, have tried to provide us
with more communication. But we've been down that rabbit hole, and we know that's not
what's going to solve the problem. Because it's not a communication problem, it's a cognitive bandwidth problem. So if the problem is one
of cognitive bandwidth, well, adding more communication to people is not going to be
what's going to solve it. What we are going to need instead
is to have other technologies that help us deal with
some of the communication that we are overloaded with. Think of, like, a little avatar, a software agent, a digital Jiminy Cricket -- 06:51(Laughter) 06:53that basically is able
to answer things on your behalf. And if we had that technology, we would be able to offload
some of the communication and help, maybe, make better decisions
or decisions at a larger scale. And the thing is that the idea
of software agents is also not new. We already use them all the time. We use software agents to choose the way that we're going
to drive to a certain location, the music that we're going to listen to or to get suggestions
for the next books that we should read. 07:25So there is an obvious idea
in the 21st century that was as obvious as the idea of putting together a steam engine
with a loom at the time of Jacquard. And that idea is combining
direct democracy with software agents. Imagine, for a second, a world in which, instead of having
a representative that represents you and millions of other people, you can have a representative
that represents only you, with your nuanced political views -- that weird combination
of libertarian and liberal and maybe a little bit
conservative on some issues and maybe very progressive on others. Politicians nowadays are packages,
and they're full of compromises. But you might have someone
that can represent only you, if you are willing to give up the idea that that representative is a human. If that representative
is a software agent, we could have a senate that has
as many senators as we have citizens. And those senators are going to be able
to read every bill and they're going to be able
to vote on each one of them. 08:27So there's an obvious idea
that maybe we want to consider. But I understand that in this day and age, this idea might be quite scary. In fact, thinking of a robot
coming from the future to help us run our governments sounds terrifying. But we've been there before. 08:45(Laughter) 08:47And actually he was quite a nice guy. 08:51So what would the Jacquard loom
version of this idea look like? It would be a very simple system. Imagine a system that you log in
and you create your avatar, and then you're going
to start training your avatar. So you can provide your avatar
with your reading habits, or connect it to your social media, or you can connect it to other data, for example by taking
psychological tests. And the nice thing about this
is that there's no deception. You are not providing data to communicate
with your friends and family that then gets used in a political system. You are providing data to a system
that is designed to be used to make political decisions
on your behalf. Then you take that data and you choose
a training algorithm, because it's an open marketplace in which different people
can submit different algorithms to predict how you're going to vote,
based on the data you have provided. And the system is open,
so nobody controls the algorithms; there are algorithms
that become more popular and others that become less popular. Eventually, you can audit the system. You can see how your avatar is working. If you like it,
you can leave it on autopilot. If you want to be
a little more controlling, you can actually choose that they ask you every time they're going
to make a decision, or you can be anywhere in between. One of the reasons
why we use democracy so little may be because democracy
has a very bad user interface. And if we improve the user
interface of democracy, we might be able to use it more. 10:16Of course, there's a lot of questions
that you might have. Well, how do you train these avatars? How do you keep the data secure? How do you keep the systems
distributed and auditable? How about my grandmother,
who's 80 years old and doesn't know how to use the internet? Trust me, I've heard them all. So when you think about an idea like this,
you have to beware of pessimists because they are known to have
a problem for every solution. 10:43(Laughter) 10:45So I want to invite you to think
about the bigger ideas. The questions I just showed you
are little ideas because they are questions
about how this would not work. The big ideas are ideas of: What else can you do with this if this would happen to work? And one of those ideas is,
well, who writes the laws? In the beginning, we could have
the avatars that we already have, voting on laws that are written
by the senators or politicians that we already have. But if this were to work, you could write an algorithm that could try to write a law that would get a certain
percentage of approval, and you could reverse the process. Now, you might think that this idea
is ludicrous and we should not do it, but you cannot deny that it's an idea
that is only possible in a world in which direct democracy
and software agents are a viable form of participation. 11:40So how do we start the revolution? We don't start this revolution
with picket fences or protests or by demanding our current politicians
to be changed into robots. That's not going to work. This is much more simple, much slower and much more humble. We start this revolution by creating
simple systems like this in grad schools, in libraries, in nonprofits. And we try to figure out
all of those little questions and those little problems that we're going to have to figure out
to make this idea something viable, to make this idea something
that we can trust. And as we create those systems that have
a hundred people, a thousand people, a hundred thousand people voting
in ways that are not politically binding, we're going to develop trust in this idea, the world is going to change, and those that are as little
as my daughter is right now are going to grow up. And by the time my daughter is my age, maybe this idea, that I know
today is very crazy, might not be crazy to her
and to her friends. And at that point, we will be at the end of our history, but they will be
at the beginning of theirs. 12:49Thank you. 12:50(Applause)"
1,How we'll earn money in a future without jobs,Martin Ford,Oct 2017,"Machines that can think, learn and adapt are coming -- and that could mean that we humans will end up with significant unemployment. What should we do about it? In a straightforward talk about a controversial idea, futurist Martin Ford makes the case for separating income from traditional work and instituting a universal basic income.", (101K),"Transcript (19 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسىکورمانجی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I'm going to begin with a scary question: Are we headed toward
a future without jobs? The remarkable progress that we're seeing in technologies like self-driving cars has led to an explosion
of interest in this question, but because it's something
that's been asked so many times in the past, maybe what we should really be asking is whether this time is really different. The fear that automation
might displace workers and potentially lead
to lots of unemployment goes back at a minimum 200 years
to the Luddite revolts in England. And since then, this concern
has come up again and again. 00:35I'm going to guess that most of you have probably never
heard of the Triple Revolution report, but this was a very prominent report. It was put together
by a brilliant group of people -- it actually included
two Nobel laureates -- and this report was presented
to the President of the United States, and it argued that the US was on the brink
of economic and social upheaval because industrial automation
was going to put millions of people out of work. Now, that report was delivered
to President Lyndon Johnson in March of 1964. So that's now over 50 years, and, of course, that
hasn't really happened. And that's been the story again and again. 01:14This alarm has been raised repeatedly, but it's always been a false alarm. And because it's been a false alarm, it's led to a very conventional way
of thinking about this. And that says essentially that yes, technology may devastate
entire industries. It may wipe out whole occupations
and types of work. But at the same time, of course, progress is going to lead
to entirely new things. So there will be new industries
that will arise in the future, and those industries, of course,
will have to hire people. There'll be new kinds of work
that will appear, and those might be things that today
we can't really even imagine. And that has been the story so far, and it's been a positive story. 01:51It turns out that the new jobs
that have been created have generally been
a lot better than the old ones. They have, for example,
been more engaging. They've been in safer,
more comfortable work environments, and, of course, they've paid more. So it has been a positive story. That's the way things
have played out so far. But there is one particular
class of worker for whom the story
has been quite different. For these workers, technology has completely
decimated their work, and it really hasn't created
any new opportunities at all. And these workers, of course, are horses. 02:26(Laughter) 02:28So I can ask a very provocative question: Is it possible that at some
point in the future, a significant fraction of the human
workforce is going to be made redundant in the way that horses were? Now, you might have a very visceral,
reflexive reaction to that. You might say, ""That's absurd. How can you possibly compare
human beings to horses?"" Horses, of course, are very limited, and when cars and trucks
and tractors came along, horses really had nowhere else to turn. People, on the other hand,
are intelligent; we can learn, we can adapt. And in theory, that ought to mean that we can
always find something new to do, and that we can always remain
relevant to the future economy. 03:09But here's the really
critical thing to understand. The machines that will threaten
workers in the future are really nothing like those cars
and trucks and tractors that displaced horses. The future is going to be full
of thinking, learning, adapting machines. And what that really means is that technology is finally
beginning to encroach on that fundamental human capability -- the thing that makes us
so different from horses, and the very thing that, so far, has allowed us to stay ahead
of the march of progress and remain relevant, and, in fact, indispensable
to the economy. So what is it that is really so different about today's information technology relative to what we've seen in the past? I would point to three fundamental things. 03:55The first thing is that we have seen
this ongoing process of exponential acceleration. I know you all know about Moore's law, but in fact, it's more
broad-based than that; it extends in many cases,
for example, to software, it extends to communications,
bandwidth and so forth. But the really key thing to understand is that this acceleration has now
been going on for a really long time. In fact, it's been going on for decades. If you measure from the late 1950s, when the first integrated
circuits were fabricated, we've seen something on the order
of 30 doublings in computational power since then. That's just an extraordinary number
of times to double any quantity, and what it really means is that we're now at a point
where we're going to see just an extraordinary amount
of absolute progress, and, of course, things are going
to continue to also accelerate from this point. So as we look forward
to the coming years and decades, I think that means
that we're going to see things that we're really not prepared for. We're going to see things
that astonish us. 04:54The second key thing is that the machines are,
in a limited sense, beginning to think. And by this, I don't mean human-level AI, or science fiction
artificial intelligence; I simply mean that machines and algorithms
are making decisions. They're solving problems,
and most importantly, they're learning. In fact, if there's one technology
that is truly central to this and has really become
the driving force behind this, it's machine learning, which is just becoming
this incredibly powerful, disruptive, scalable technology. 05:27One of the best examples
I've seen of that recently was what Google's DeepMind
division was able to do with its AlphaGo system. Now, this is the system that was able
to beat the best player in the world at the ancient game of Go. Now, at least to me, there are two things that really
stand out about the game of Go. One is that as you're playing the game, the number of configurations
that the board can be in is essentially infinite. There are actually more possibilities
than there are atoms in the universe. So what that means is, you're never going to be able to build
a computer to win at the game of Go the way chess was approached, for example, which is basically to throw
brute-force computational power at it. So clearly, a much more sophisticated,
thinking-like approach is needed. The second thing
that really stands out is that, if you talk to one
of the championship Go players, this person cannot necessarily
even really articulate what exactly it is they're thinking about
as they play the game. It's often something
that's very intuitive, it's almost just like a feeling
about which move they should make. 06:30So given those two qualities, I would say that playing Go
at a world champion level really ought to be something
that's safe from automation, and the fact that it isn't should really
raise a cautionary flag for us. And the reason is that we tend
to draw a very distinct line, and on one side of that line
are all the jobs and tasks that we perceive as being on some level
fundamentally routine and repetitive and predictable. And we know that these jobs
might be in different industries, they might be in different occupations
and at different skill levels, but because they are innately predictable, we know they're probably at some point
going to be susceptible to machine learning, and therefore, to automation. And make no mistake --
that's a lot of jobs. That's probably something
on the order of roughly half the jobs in the economy. 07:18But then on the other side of that line, we have all the jobs
that require some capability that we perceive as being uniquely human, and these are the jobs
that we think are safe. Now, based on what I know
about the game of Go, I would've guessed that it really ought
to be on the safe side of that line. But the fact that it isn't,
and that Google solved this problem, suggests that that line is going
to be very dynamic. It's going to shift, and it's going to shift in a way
that consumes more and more jobs and tasks that we currently perceive
as being safe from automation. 07:49The other key thing to understand is that this is by no means just about
low-wage jobs or blue-collar jobs, or jobs and tasks done by people that have relatively
low levels of education. There's lots of evidence to show that these technologies are rapidly
climbing the skills ladder. So we already see an impact
on professional jobs -- tasks done by people like accountants, financial analysts, journalists, lawyers, radiologists and so forth. So a lot of the assumptions that we make about the kind of occupations
and tasks and jobs that are going to be threatened
by automation in the future are very likely to be
challenged going forward. 08:28So as we put these trends together, I think what it shows is that we could
very well end up in a future with significant unemployment. Or at a minimum, we could face lots of underemployment
or stagnant wages, maybe even declining wages. And, of course, soaring levels
of inequality. All of that, of course, is going to put
a terrific amount of stress on the fabric of society. But beyond that, there's also
a fundamental economic problem, and that arises because jobs
are currently the primary mechanism that distributes income,
and therefore purchasing power, to all the consumers that buy the products
and services we're producing. 09:10In order to have a vibrant market economy, you've got to have
lots and lots of consumers that are really capable of buying
the products and services that are being produced. If you don't have that,
then you run the risk of economic stagnation, or maybe even a declining economic spiral, as there simply aren't enough
customers out there to buy the products
and services being produced. 09:32It's really important to realize that all of us as individuals rely
on access to that market economy in order to be successful. You can visualize that by thinking
in terms of one really exceptional person. Imagine for a moment you take,
say, Steve Jobs, and you drop him
on an island all by himself. On that island, he's going
to be running around, gathering coconuts just like anyone else. He's really not going to be
anything special, and the reason, of course,
is that there is no market for him to scale
his incredible talents across. So access to this market
is really critical to us as individuals, and also to the entire system
in terms of it being sustainable. 10:13So the question then becomes:
What exactly could we do about this? And I think you can view this
through a very utopian framework. You can imagine a future
where we all have to work less, we have more time for leisure, more time to spend with our families, more time to do things that we find
genuinely rewarding and so forth. And I think that's a terrific vision. That's something that we should
absolutely strive to move toward. But at the same time, I think
we have to be realistic, and we have to realize that we're very likely to face
a significant income distribution problem. A lot of people are likely
to be left behind. And I think that in order
to solve that problem, we're ultimately going
to have to find a way to decouple incomes from traditional work. And the best, more straightforward
way I know to do that is some kind of a guaranteed income
or universal basic income. 11:04Now, basic income is becoming
a very important idea. It's getting a lot
of traction and attention, there are a lot of important
pilot projects and experiments going on
throughout the world. My own view is that a basic income
is not a panacea; it's not necessarily
a plug-and-play solution, but rather, it's a place to start. It's an idea that we can
build on and refine. For example, one thing that I have
written quite a lot about is the possibility of incorporating
explicit incentives into a basic income. To illustrate that, imagine that you are a struggling
high school student. Imagine that you are at risk
of dropping out of school. And yet, suppose you know
that at some point in the future, no matter what, you're going to get the same
basic income as everyone else. Now, to my mind, that creates
a very perverse incentive for you to simply give up
and drop out of school. 11:54So I would say, let's not
structure things that way. Instead, let's pay people who graduate
from high school somewhat more than those who simply drop out. And we can take that idea of building
incentives into a basic income, and maybe extend it to other areas. For example, we might create
an incentive to work in the community to help others, or perhaps to do positive
things for the environment, and so forth. So by incorporating incentives
into a basic income, we might actually improve it, and also, perhaps, take at least
a couple of steps towards solving another problem that I think we're quite possibly
going to face in the future, and that is, how do we all find
meaning and fulfillment, and how do we occupy our time in a world where perhaps
there's less demand for traditional work? 12:42So by extending and refining
a basic income, I think we can make it look better, and we can also, perhaps, make it
more politically and socially acceptable and feasible -- and, of course, by doing that, we increase the odds
that it will actually come to be. 12:59I think one of the most fundamental, almost instinctive objections that many of us have
to the idea of a basic income, or really to any significant
expansion of the safety net, is this fear that we're going to end up
with too many people riding in the economic cart, and not enough people pulling that cart. And yet, really, the whole point
I'm making here, of course, is that in the future, machines are increasingly going
to be capable of pulling that cart for us. That should give us more options for the way we structure
our society and our economy, And I think eventually, it's going to go
beyond simply being an option, and it's going to become an imperative. The reason, of course,
is that all of this is going to put such a degree of stress on our society, and also because jobs are that mechanism that gets purchasing power to consumers so they can then drive the economy. If, in fact, that mechanism
begins to erode in the future, then we're going to need to replace
it with something else or we're going to face the risk that our whole system simply
may not be sustainable. 14:00But the bottom line here
is that I really think that solving these problems, and especially finding a way
to build a future economy that works for everyone, at every level of our society, is going to be one of the most important
challenges that we all face in the coming years and decades. 14:18Thank you very much. 14:20(Applause)"
1,An AI smartwatch that detects seizures,Rosalind Picard,Apr 2019,"Every year worldwide, more than 50,000 otherwise healthy people with epilepsy suddenly die -- a condition known as SUDEP. These deaths may be largely preventable, says AI researcher Rosalind Picard. Learn how Picard helped develop a cutting-edge smartwatch that can detect epileptic seizures as they occur and alert nearby loved ones in time to help.", (60K),"Transcript (15 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийбългарскиالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01This is Henry, a cute boy, and when Henry was three, his mom found him having
some febrile seizures. Febrile seizures are seizures that occur
when you also have a fever, and the doctor said, ""Don't worry too much.
Kids usually outgrow these."" When he was four,
he had a convulsive seizure, the kind that you lose
consciousness and shake -- a generalized tonic-clonic seizure -- and while the diagnosis of epilepsy
was in the mail, Henry's mom went to get him
out of bed one morning, and as she went in his room, she found his cold, lifeless body. 00:55footnotefootnoteHenry died of SUDEP, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. I'm curious how many of you
have heard of SUDEP. This is a very well-educated audience,
and I see only a few hands. SUDEP is when an otherwise
healthy person with epilepsy dies and they can't attribute it
to anything they can find in an autopsy. There is a SUDEP
every seven to nine minutes. That's on average two per TED Talk. Now, a normal brain
has electrical activity. You can see some of the electrical waves coming out of this picture
of a brain here. And these should look
like typical electrical activity that an EEG could read on the surface. When you have a seizure,
it's a bit of unusual electrical activity, and it can be focal. It can take place
in just a small part of your brain. When that happens,
you might have a strange sensation. Several could be happening
here in the audience right now, and the person next to you
might not even know. However, if you have a seizure
where that little brush fire spreads like a forest fire over the brain, then it generalizes, and that generalized seizure
takes your consciousness away and causes you to convulse. 02:18footnotefootnoteThere are more SUDEPs
in the United States every year than sudden infant death syndrome. Now, how many of you have heard
of sudden infant death syndrome? Right? Pretty much every hand goes up. So what's going on here? Why is this so much more common
and yet people haven't heard of it? And what can you do to prevent it? Well, there are two things,
scientifically shown, that prevent or reduce the risk of SUDEP. The first is: ""Follow
your doctor's instructions, take your medications."" Two-thirds of people who have epilepsy get it under control
with their medications. The second thing that reduces
the risk of SUDEP is companionship. It's having somebody there
at the time that you have a seizure. Now, SUDEP, even though
most of you have never heard of it, is actually the number two cause
of years of potential life lost of all neurological disorders. The vertical axis is the number of deaths times the remaining life span, so higher is much worse impact. SUDEP, however, unlike these others, is something that people right here
could do something to push that down. 03:37footnotefootnoteNow, what is Roz Picard, an AI researcher,
doing here telling you about SUDEP, right? I'm not a neurologist. When I was working at the Media Lab
on measurement of emotion, trying to make our machines
more intelligent about our emotions, we started doing a lot of work
measuring stress. We built lots of sensors that measured it
in lots of different ways. But one of them in particular grew out of some of this very old work
with measuring sweaty palms with an electrical signal. This is a signal of skin conductance that's known to go up
when you get nervous, but it turns out it also goes up with
a lot of other interesting conditions. But measuring it with wires on your hand
is really inconvenient. So we invented a bunch of other ways
of doing this at the MIT Media Lab. And with these wearables, we started to collect the first-ever
clinical quality data 24-7. Here's a picture of what that looked like the first time an MIT student collected
skin conductance on the wrist 24-7. Let's zoom in a little bit here. What you see is 24 hours
from left to right, and here is two days of data. And first, what surprised us was sleep was the biggest
peak of the day. Now, that sounds broken, right? You're calm when you're asleep,
so what's going on here? 05:02Well, it turns out
that our physiology during sleep is very different
than our physiology during wake, and while there's still a bit of a mystery why these peaks are usually
the biggest of the day during sleep, we now believe they're related
to memory consolidation and memory formation during sleep. 05:19We also saw things
that were exactly what we expected. When an MIT student
is working hard in the lab or on homeworks, there is not only emotional stress,
but there's cognitive load, and it turns out that cognitive load,
cognitive effort, mental engagement, excitement about learning something -- those things also make the signal go up. 05:43Unfortunately, to the embarrassment
of we MIT professors, 05:46(Laughter) 05:47the low point every day
is classroom activity. Now, I am just showing you
one person's data here, but this, unfortunately,
is true in general. 06:00This sweatband has inside it
a homebuilt skin-conductance sensor, and one day, one of our undergrads
knocked on my door right at the end of the December semester, and he said, ""Professor Picard, can I please borrow
one of your wristband sensors? My little brother has autism,
he can't talk, and I want to see
what's stressing him out."" And I said, ""Sure, in fact,
don't just take one, take two,"" because they broke easily back then. So he took them home,
he put them on his little brother. Now, I was back in MIT,
looking at the data on my laptop, and the first day, I thought,
""Hmm, that's odd, he put them on both wrists
instead of waiting for one to break. OK, fine, don't follow my instructions."" I'm glad he didn't. Second day -- chill.
Looked like classroom activity. 06:49(Laughter) 06:51A few more days ahead. The next day, one wrist signal was flat and the other had
the biggest peak I've ever seen, and I thought, ""What's going on? We've stressed people out at MIT
every way imaginable. I've never seen a peak this big."" And it was only on one side. How can you be stressed on one side
of your body and not the other? So I thought one or both sensors
must be broken. Now, I'm an electroengineer by training, so I started a whole bunch of stuff
to try to debug this, and long story short,
I could not reproduce this. 07:28So I resorted to old-fashioned debugging. I called the student at home on vacation. ""Hi, how's your little brother?
How's your Christmas? Hey, do you have any idea
what happened to him?"" And I gave this particular date and time, and the data. And he said, ""I don't know,
I'll check the diary."" 07:50Diary? An MIT student keeps a diary? So I waited and he came back. He had the exact date and time, and he says, ""That was right before
he had a grand mal seizure."" 08:02Now, at the time, I didn't know
anything about epilepsy, and did a bunch of research, realized that another student's dad
is chief of neurosurgery at Children's Hospital Boston, screwed up my courage
and called Dr. Joe Madsen. 08:15footnotefootnote""Hi, Dr. Madsen,
my name's Rosalind Picard. Is it possible somebody could have a huge sympathetic
nervous system surge"" -- that's what drives the skin conductance -- ""20 minutes before a seizure?"" And he says, ""Probably not."" He says, ""It's interesting. We've had people whose hair
stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure."" And I'm like, ""On one arm?"" I didn't want to tell him that, initially, because I thought this was too ridiculous. 08:48He explained how this could
happen in the brain, and he got interested.
I showed him the data. We made a whole bunch more devices,
got them safety certified. 90 families were being
enrolled in a study, all with children who were going
to be monitored 24-7 with gold-standard EEG on their scalp for reading the brain activity, video to watch the behavior, electrocardiogram -- ECG --
and now EDA, electrodermal activity, to see if there was
something in this periphery that we could easily pick up,
related to a seizure. 09:18footnotefootnoteWe found, in 100 percent
of the first batch of grand mal seizures, this whopper of responses
in the skin conductance. The blue in the middle, the boy's sleep, is usually the biggest peak of the day. These three seizures you see here
are popping out of the forest like redwood trees. Furthermore, when you couple
the skin conductance at the top with the movement from the wrist and you get lots of data
and train machine learning and AI on it, you can build an automated AI
that detects these patterns much better than just
a shake detector can do. So we realized that we needed
to get this out, and with the PhD work of Ming-Zher Poh and later great improvements by Empatica, this has made progress and the seizure
detection is much more accurate. 10:13footnotefootnoteBut we also learned some other things
about SUDEP during this. One thing we learned is that SUDEP, while it's rare after
a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, that's when it's most likely
to happen -- after that type. And when it happens,
it doesn't happen during the seizure, and it doesn't usually happen
immediately afterwards, but immediately afterwards, when the person just seems
very still and quiet, they may go into another phase,
where the breathing stops, and then after the breathing stops,
later the heart stops. So there's some time
to get somebody there. We also learned that there is a region
deep in the brain called the amygdala, which we had been studying
in our emotion research a lot. We have two amygdalas, and if you stimulate the right one, you get a big right
skin conductance response. Now, you have to sign up right now
for a craniotomy to get this done, not exactly something
we're going to volunteer to do, but it causes a big right skin
conductance response. Stimulate the left one, big left
skin conductance response on the palm. And furthermore, when somebody
stimulates your amygdala while you're sitting there
and you might just be working, you don't show any signs of distress, but you stop breathing, and you don't start again
until somebody stimulates you. ""Hey, Roz, are you there?"" And you open your mouth to talk. As you take that breath to speak, you start breathing again. 11:42So we had started with work on stress, which had enabled us
to build lots of sensors that were gathering
high quality enough data that we could leave the lab
and start to get this in the wild; accidentally found a whopper
of a response with the seizure, neurological activation that can cause
a much bigger response than traditional stressors; lots of partnership with hospitals
and an epilepsy monitoring unit, especially Children's Hospital Boston and the Brigham; and machine learning and AI on top of this to take and collect lots more data in service of trying
to understand these events and if we could prevent SUDEP. 12:18This is now commercialized by Empatica, a start-up that I had
the privilege to cofound, and the team there has done an amazing job
improving the technology to make a very beautiful sensor that not only tells time and does steps
and sleep and all that good stuff, but this is running real-time
AI and machine learning to detect generalized
tonic-clonic seizures and send an alert for help if I were to have a seizure
and lose consciousness. This just got FDA-approved as the first smartwatch
to get approved in neurology. 12:53(Applause) 13:02Now, the next slide is what made
my skin conductance go up. One morning, I'm checking my email and I see a story from a mom who said she was in the shower, and her phone was
on the counter by the shower, and it said her daughter
might need her help. So she interrupts her shower and goes
running to her daughter's bedroom, and she finds her daughter
facedown in bed, blue and not breathing. She flips her over -- human stimulation -- and her daughter takes a breath,
and another breath, and her daughter turns pink and is fine. 13:37I think I turned white reading this email. My first response is,
""Oh no, it's not perfect. The Bluetooth could break,
the battery could die. All these things could go wrong.
Don't rely on this."" And she said, ""It's OK.
I know no technology is perfect. None of us can always
be there all the time. But this, this device plus AI enabled me to get there in time
to save my daughter's life."" 14:05footnotefootnoteNow, I've been mentioning children, but SUDEP peaks, actually,
among people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and the next line I'm going to put up is probably going to make
some people uncomfortable, but it's less uncomfortable
than we'll all be if this list is extended
to somebody you know. Could this happen to somebody you know? And the reason I bring up
this uncomfortable question is because one in 26 of you
will have epilepsy at some point, and from what I've been learning, people with epilepsy often don't tell
their friends and their neighbors that they have it. So if you're willing to let them
use an AI or whatever to summon you in a moment
of possible need, if you would let them know that, you could make a difference in their life. 14:55Why do all this hard work to build AIs? A couple of reasons here: one is Natasha, the girl who lived, and her family wanted me
to tell you her name. Another is her family and the wonderful people out there who want to be there to support people
who have conditions that they've felt uncomfortable
in the past mentioning to others. And the other reason is all of you, because we have the opportunity
to shape the future of AI. We can actually change it, because we are the ones building it. 15:29So let's build AI that makes everybody's lives better. 15:35Thank you. 15:37(Applause)"
1,4 lessons from robots about being human,Ken Goldberg,May 2012,"The more that robots ingrain themselves into our everyday lives, the more we're forced to examine ourselves as people. At TEDxBerkeley, Ken Goldberg shares four very human lessons that he's learned from working with robots.", (11K),"Transcript (25 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Morton Bast, TranslatorThu-Huong Ha, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00I know this is going to sound strange, but I think robots can inspire us
to be better humans. See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer, and when I was growing up,
he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go-kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best
friend at the time. And one day, he came home, when I was
about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, 
we were going to build ... a robot. 00:49A robot. Now, I was thrilled about this, because at school,
there was a bully named Kevin, and he was picking on me, because I was the only
Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get
started to work on this, so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. 01:06(Laughter) 01:07(Robot noises) 01:17(Laughter) 01:18But that wasn't the kind of robot
my dad had in mind. 01:22(Laughter) 01:23See, he owned a chromium-plating company, and they had to move heavy steel parts
between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed
an industrial robot like this, that could basically do the heavy lifting. 01:39But my dad didn't get
the kind of robot he wanted, either. He and I worked on it for several years, but it was the 1970s, and the technology
that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do
this kind of work by hand. And a few years later, he was diagnosed with cancer. 02:03You see, what the robot we were trying
to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time, and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of 45. I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot
that he and I tried to build. When I was at college, I decided
to study engineering, like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon,
and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. 02:42So what I'd like to tell you about
are four robot projects, and how they've inspired me
to be a better human. By 1993, I was a young professor at USC, and I was just building up
my own robotics lab, and this was the year
the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students
were the ones who told me about it, and we would -- we were just amazed. We started playing with this,
and that afternoon, we realized that we could use
this new, universal interface to allow anyone in the world
to operate the robot in our lab. 03:25footnotefootnoteSo, rather than have it fight
or do industrial work, we decided to build a planter, put the robot into the center of it, and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera
in the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote some
special scripts and software, so that anyone in the world could come in, and by clicking on the screen, they could move the robot around
and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate
and help us water the garden, remotely. And if you watered it a few times, we'd give you your own seed to plant. 04:07Now, this was an engineering project, and we published some papers
on the system design of it, but we also thought of it
as an art installation. It was invited, after the first year, by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria, to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say, it remained
online there, 24 hours a day, for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. 04:41Now, one day, I got a call out of the blue
from a student, who asked a very simple
but profound question. He said, ""Is the robot real?"" Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was,
because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant, because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures
of flowers in a garden and then, basically, index them
in a computer system, such that it would appear
that there was a real robot, when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it, I couldn't think of a good answer
for how he could tell the difference. 05:20This was right about the time
that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who's a world-renowned
professor of philosophy, And I talked with him
about this and he said, ""This is one of the oldest
and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics
and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology, the study of how do we know
that something is true."" 05:50footnotefootnoteSo he and I started working together, and we coined a new term:
""telepistemology,"" the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists,
engineers and philosophers to write essays about this, and the results are collected
in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student, who questioned what everyone else
had assumed to be true, this project taught me
an important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions. 06:23Now, the second project
I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating, my students
and I were very interested in how people were interacting
with each other, and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other
interesting environment? Like, for example,
what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House? 06:45(Laughter) 06:48So, because we were interested
more in the system design and the user interface
than in the hardware, we decided that, rather than have a robot replace
the human to go to the party, we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele-Actor. 07:05footnotefootnoteWe got a human, someone who's very
outgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmet
with various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wireless
Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experience
what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly,
they could participate, by interacting with each other
and coming up with ideas about what she should do next
and where she should go, and then conveying those
to the Tele-Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went
up, I had about 30 seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson
what we were going to do. And I said, ""The Tele-Actor
is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project, and people are watching her
on their screens, there's cameras involved
and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear, and people over the network
are giving her advice about what to do next."" And he said, ""Wait a second. That's what I do."" 08:29(Laughter) 08:34So he loved the concept, and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,
she walked right up to him, and she gave him a big kiss
right on the lips. 08:42(Laughter) 08:44We were totally surprised --
we had no idea that would happen. And he was great, he just gave her
a big hug in return, and it worked out great. But that night, as we were packing up, I asked the Tele-Actor,
how did the Tele-Directors decide that they would give
a kiss to Sam Donaldson? And she said they hadn't. She said, when she was
just about to walk onstage, the Tele-Directors still were trying
to agree on what to do, and so she just walked onstage
and did what felt most natural. 09:14(Laughter) 09:18So, the success
of the Tele-Actor that night was due to the fact
that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me
another lesson about life, which is that, when in doubt, improvise. 09:36(Laughter) 09:38Now, the third project
grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment --
chemotherapy treatments -- and there's a related treatment
called brachytherapy, where tiny, radioactive seeds
are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done,
as you can see here, is that surgeons
insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles
are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some
of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result, the needles damage
these organs, cause damage, which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered: what if we could modify the system, so that the needles
could come in at different angles? 10:40So we simulated this; we developed some optimization
algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid
the delicate organs, and yet still achieve the coverage
of the tumors with the radiation. 10:55footnotefootnoteSo now, we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins, and we're building a robot
that has a number of -- it's a specialized design
with different joints that can allow the needles to come in
at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here,
they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets
they're aiming for. So, by questioning this assumption
that all the needles have to be parallel, this project also taught me
an important lesson: When in doubt, when your path
is blocked, pivot. 11:33And the last project
also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something
that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially
available device. It's being used in over 2,000
hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon
to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very
routine and tedious, like suturing, and currently, all of these are performed under the specific and immediate
control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering, what if we could program the robot
to perform some of these subtasks, and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated
parts of the surgery, and also cut down on the time
that the surgery would take if we could get the robot
to do them a little bit faster? 12:32Now, it's hard to program a robot
to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague
Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has developed a new set of techniques
for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters, do incredibly interesting,
beautiful acrobatics, by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter
and his students. And we asked a surgeon
to perform a task -- with the robot. So what we're doing is asking
the surgeon to perform the task, and we record the motions of the robot. 13:13So here's an example. I'll use tracing out
a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like
when the robot -- this is what the robot's path
looks like, those three examples. Now, those are much better
than what a novice like me could do, but they're still jerky and imprecise. 13:31footnotefootnoteSo we record all these examples, the data, and then go through a sequence of steps. First, we use a technique
called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally
align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering,
a technique from control theory, that allows us to statistically
analyze all the noise and extract the desired
trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations -- they're all noisy and imperfect -- and we extract from them
an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot, we observe what happens, then we adjust the controls, using a sequence of techniques
called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase
the velocity a little bit. We observe the results,
adjust the controls again, and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. 14:33And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory, and here's the robot
moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating
at 10 times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot
to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask, at 10 times the speed of a human. So this project also, because of its involved
practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitute
for practice, practice, practice. 15:21So these are four of the lessons
that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics
has gotten much better over time. Nowadays, high school students
can build robots, like the industrial robot
my dad and I tried to build. 15:40But, it's very -- now ... And now, I have a daughter, named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots, too. Maybe it runs in the family. 15:55(Laughter) 15:56I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her
how things work, and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons
she'll learn from them. 16:10Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all
of the world's problems, but I think they have something
important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations
that you're interested in, the machines that you wish for. And think about
what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many
of our technological innovations, the devices we dream about, can inspire us to be better humans. 16:45Thank you. 16:47(Applause)"
2,Why people and AI make good business partners,Shervin Khodabandeh,Apr 2022,"What happens when the data-driven capabilities of AI are combined with human creativity and ingenuity? Shining a light on the opportunities this futuristic collaboration could bring to the workplace, AI expert Shervin Khodabandeh shares how to redesign companies so that people and machines can learn from each other.", (50K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00I've been working in AI
for most of my career, helping companies build
artificial intelligence capabilities to improve their business, which is why I think
what I'm about to tell you is quite shocking. Every year, thousands
of companies across the world spend collectively tens of billions
of dollars to build AI capabilities. But according to research
my colleagues and I have done, only about 10 percent of these companies
get any meaningful financial impact from their investments. These 10 percent winners
with AI have a secret. And their secret is not about fancy
algorithms or sophisticated technology. It's something far more basic. It's how they get their people
and AI to work together. Together, not against each other, not instead of each other. Together in a mutually
beneficial relationship. 00:55Unfortunately, when most people
think about AI, they think about the most extreme cases. That AI is here only to replace us or overtake our intelligence
and make us unnecessary. But what I'm saying is that we don't seem to quite appreciate
the huge opportunity that exists in the middle ground, where humans and AI come together to achieve outcomes that neither one
could do alone on their own. 01:21Consider the game of chess. You probably knew that AI today
can beat any human grandmaster. But did you know that the combination
of a human chess player and AI can beat not only any human
but also any machine. The combination is much more powerful
than the sum of its parts. In a perfect combination,
AI will do what it does best, which is dealing with massive amounts
of data and solving complex problems. And humans do what we do best using our creativity, our judgment,
our empathy, our ethics and our ability to compromise. 01:59For several years, my colleagues and I have studied and worked with hundreds
of winning companies who are successfully building
these human-AI relationships. And what we've seen is quite interesting. First of all, these companies get
five times more financial value than companies who use AI
only to replace people. Most importantly,
they have a happier workforce. Their employees are more
proud, more fulfilled, they collaborate better with each other,
and they're more effective. Five times more value
and a happier workforce. 02:33So the question is,
how do these companies do it? How do they achieve these symbiotic
human-AI relationships? I have some answers. First of all, they don't think of AI
in the most extreme case only to replace humans. Instead, they look deep
inside their organizations and at the various roles
their people play. And they ask: How can AI make our people
more fulfilled, more effective, more amplified? Let me give you an example. Humana is a health care
company here in the US. It has pharmacy call centers
where pharmacists work with patients over the phone. It's a job that requires a fair amount
of empathy and humanity. Humana has developed an AI system that listens to the
pharmacists' conversation and picks up emotional and tone signals and then gives real-time
suggestions to the pharmacists on how to improve the quality
of that conversation. For example, it might say
“Slow down” or “Pause” or ""Hey, consider how the other person
is feeling right now."" All to improve the quality
of that conversation. I'm pretty sure my wife
would buy me one of these if she could, just to help me in some
of my conversations with her. 03:48(Laughter) 03:49Turns out the pharmacists
like it quite a lot, too. They're more effective in their jobs, but they also learn something
about themselves, their own behaviors and biases. The result has been
more effective pharmacists and much higher customer
satisfaction scores. 04:05Now, this is just one example of many
possibilities where human AI collaborate. In this example, AI was a recommender. It didn't replace the human
or make any decisions of its own. It simply made suggestions, and it was up to the person
to decide and act. And at the heart of it is a feedback loop, which, by the way, is very critical
for any human-AI relationship. By that I mean that in this example, first AI had to learn from humans
the qualities that would make up a good or not so good conversation. And then over time,
as AI built more intelligence, it would be able to make suggestions, but it would be up to the person
to decide and act. And if they didn't agree
with the recommendation because it might have not
made sense to them, they didn't have to. In which case AI might learn something
and adapt for the future. It's basically open, frequent,
two-way communication, like any couples therapist will tell you, is very important for any
good relationship. 05:11Now the key word here is relationship. Think about your own personal
relationships with other people. You don't have the same kind
of relationship with your accountant or your boss or your spouse, do you? Well, I certainly hope not. And just like that, the right relationship
between human and AI in a company is not a one-size-fits-all. So in the case of Humana,
AI was a recommender and a human was decision-maker and actor. In some other examples,
AI might be an evaluator where a human comes up
with ideas or scenarios, and AI evaluates the complex implications
and tradeoffs of those ideas and makes it easy for humans to decide
the best course of action. In some other examples,
AI might take a more creative role. It could be an illuminator
where it can take a complex problem and come up with potential
solutions to that problem and illuminate some options that might have been impossible
for humans to see. 06:14Let me give you another example. During the COVID pandemic, if you walked into a retail
or grocery store, you saw that many retailers
were struggling. Their shelves were empty, their suppliers were not able
to fulfill the orders, and with all the uncertainties
of the pandemic, they simply had no idea how many people
would be walking into what stores, demanding what products. Now, to put this in perspective, this is a problem that's already quite
hard when things are normal. Retailers have to predict demand for tens of thousands of products
across thousands of locations and thousands of suppliers every day to manage and optimize their inventory. Add to that the uncertainties of COVID
and the global supply chain disruptions, and this became 100 times more difficult. And many retailers were simply paralyzed. But there were a few who had built
strong foundations with AI and the human-AI feedback loop
that we talked about. And these guys were able
to navigate all this uncertainty much better than others. They used AI to analyze
tens of billions of data points on consumer behavior
and global supply chain disruptions and local government closures and mandates and traffic on highways and ocean freight lanes and many,
many other factors and get a pretty good handle on what
consumers in each unique area wanted the most, what would have been feasible, and for items that were not available, what substitutions could be made. But AI alone without the human touch
wouldn't work either. There were ethical and economic tradeoffs
that had to be considered. For example, deciding
to bring in a product that didn't have a good margin
for the retailer but would really help support
the local community at their time of need. After all, AI couldn't quite understand the uniquely human behavior
of panic-buying toilet paper or tens of gallons of liquor, only to be used as hand sanitizer. It was the combination that was the key. 08:22And the winning companies know this. They also know that inside
their companies, there's literally hundreds of these
opportunities for human-AI combination, and they actively identify
and pursue them. They think of AI as much more broadly
a means to replace people. They look inside their organizations and re-imagine how the biggest challenges
and opportunities of their company can be addressed by the combination of human and AI. And they put in place the right
combination for each unique situation. Whether it's the recommender
or the evaluator or the illuminator or optimizer
or many, many other ones. They build and evolve the feedback loops
that we talked about. And finally and most importantly,
they don't just throw technology at it. In fact, this has been
the biggest pitfall of companies who don't get their return
from their AI investments. If they overinvest in technology expecting a piece of tech
to solve all their problems. But there is no silver bullet. Technology and automation
can only go so far, and for every one automation
opportunity inside a company, there's literally ten for collaboration. But collaboration's hard. It requires a new mindset and doing things differently
than how we've always done it. 09:44And the winning companies
know this, too, which is why they don't just
invest in technology, but so much more on human factors, on their people,
on training and reskilling and reimagining how their people
and AI work together in new ways. Inside these companies,
it's not just machines replacing humans. It's machines and humans working together, learning from each other. And when that happens, the organization's overall rate
of learning increases, which in turn makes the company
much more agile, much more resilient, ready to adapt
and take on any challenge. It is the human touch
that will bring the best out of AI. 10:26Thank you. 10:27(Applause)"
1,How bad data keeps us from good AI,Mainak Mazumdar,Jan 2021,"The future economy won't be built by people and factories, but by algorithms and artificial intelligence, says data scientist Mainak Mazumdar. But what happens when these algorithms get trained on biased data? Drawing on examples from Shanghai to New York City, Mazumdar shows how less-than-quality data leads to AI that makes wrong decisions and predictions -- and reveals three infrastructural resets needed to make ethical AI possible.", (43K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroالعربية中文 (简体)한국어Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:01AI could add 16 trillion dollars
to the global economy in the next 10 years. This economy is not going
to be built by billions of people or millions of factories, but by computers and algorithms. We have already seen
amazing benefits of AI in simplifying tasks, bringing efficiencies and improving our lives. However, when it comes to fair
and equitable policy decision-making, AI has not lived up to its promise. AI is becoming a gatekeeper
to the economy, deciding who gets a job and who gets an access to a loan. AI is only reinforcing
and accelerating our bias at speed and scale with societal implications. So, is AI failing us? Are we designing these algorithms
to deliver biased and wrong decisions? 01:04As a data scientist, I'm here to tell you, it's not the algorithm, but the biased data that's responsible for these decisions. To make AI possible
for humanity and society, we need an urgent reset. Instead of algorithms, we need to focus on the data. We're spending time and money to scale AI at the expense of designing and collecting
high-quality and contextual data. We need to stop the data,
or the biased data that we already have, and focus on three things: data infrastructure, data quality and data literacy. 01:45In June of this year, we saw embarrassing bias
in the Duke University AI model called PULSE, which enhanced a blurry image into a recognizable
photograph of a person. This algorithm incorrectly enhanced
a nonwhite image into a Caucasian image. African-American images
were underrepresented in the training set, leading to wrong decisions
and predictions. Probably this is not the first time you have seen an AI misidentify
a Black person's image. Despite an improved AI methodology, the underrepresentation
of racial and ethnic populations still left us with biased results. 02:33This research is academic, however, not all data biases are academic. Biases have real consequences. 02:42Take the 2020 US Census. The census is the foundation for many social
and economic policy decisions, therefore the census is required
to count 100 percent of the population in the United States. However, with the pandemic and the politics
of the citizenship question, undercounting of minorities
is a real possibility. I expect significant undercounting
of minority groups who are hard to locate, contact, persuade
and interview for the census. Undercounting will introduce bias and erode the quality
of our data infrastructure. 03:24Let's look at undercounts
in the 2010 census. 16 million people were omitted
in the final counts. This is as large as the total population of Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma
and Iowa put together for that year. We have also seen about a million kids
under the age of five undercounted in the 2010 Census. 03:47Now, undercounting of minorities is common in other national censuses, as minorities can be harder to reach, they're mistrustful towards the government or they live in an area
under political unrest. 04:02For example, the Australian Census in 2016 undercounted Aboriginals
and Torres Strait populations by about 17.5 percent. We estimate undercounting in 2020 to be much higher than 2010, and the implications
of this bias can be massive. 04:24Let's look at the implications
of the census data. Census is the most trusted, open
and publicly available rich data on population composition
and characteristics. While businesses
have proprietary information on consumers, the Census Bureau
reports definitive, public counts on age, gender, ethnicity, race, employment, family status, as well as geographic distribution, which are the foundation
of the population data infrastructure. When minorities are undercounted, AI models supporting
public transportation, housing, health care, insurance are likely to overlook the communities
that require these services the most. 05:11First step to improving results is to make that database representative of age, gender, ethnicity and race per census data. Since census is so important, we have to make every effort
to count 100 percent. Investing in this data
quality and accuracy is essential to making AI possible, not for only few and privileged, but for everyone in the society. 05:39Most AI systems use the data
that's already available or collected for some other purposes because it's convenient and cheap. Yet data quality is a discipline
that requires commitment -- real commitment. This attention to the definition, data collection
and measurement of the bias, is not only underappreciated -- in the world of speed,
scale and convenience, it's often ignored. 06:07As part of Nielsen data science team, I went to field visits to collect data, visiting retail stores
outside Shanghai and Bangalore. The goal of that visit was to measure
retail sales from those stores. We drove miles outside the city, found these small stores -- informal, hard to reach. And you may be wondering -- why are we interested
in these specific stores? We could have selected a store in the city where the electronic data could be
easily integrated into a data pipeline -- cheap, convenient and easy. Why are we so obsessed with the quality and accuracy of the data
from these stores? The answer is simple: because the data
from these rural stores matter. According to the International
Labour Organization, 40 percent Chinese and 65 percent of Indians
live in rural areas. Imagine the bias in decision when 65 percent of consumption
in India is excluded in models, meaning the decision will favor
the urban over the rural. 07:17Without this rural-urban context and signals on livelihood,
lifestyle, economy and values, retail brands will make wrong investments
on pricing, advertising and marketing. Or the urban bias will lead
to wrong rural policy decisions with regards to health
and other investments. Wrong decisions are not the problem
with the AI algorithm. It's a problem of the data that excludes areas intended
to be measured in the first place. The data in the context is a priority, not the algorithms. 07:57Let's look at another example. I visited these remote,
trailer park homes in Oregon state and New York City apartments to invite these homes
to participate in Nielsen panels. Panels are statistically
representative samples of homes that we invite to participate
in the measurement over a period of time. Our mission to include everybody
in the measurement led us to collect data
from these Hispanic and African homes who use over-the-air
TV reception to an antenna. Per Nielsen data, these homes constitute
15 percent of US households, which is about 45 million people. Commitment and focus on quality
means we made every effort to collect information from these 15 percent,
hard-to-reach groups. 08:51Why does it matter? This is a sizeable group that's very, very important
to the marketers, brands, as well as the media companies. Without the data, the marketers and brands and their models would not be able to reach these folks, as well as show ads to these
very, very important minority populations. And without the ad revenue, the broadcasters such as
Telemundo or Univision, would not be able to deliver free content, including news media, which is so foundational to our democracy. 09:27This data is essential
for businesses and society. Our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to reduce human bias in AI starts with the data. Instead of racing to build new algorithms, my mission is to build
a better data infrastructure that makes ethical AI possible. I hope you will join me
in my mission as well. 09:53Thank you."
2,3 myths about the future of work (and why they're not true),Daniel Susskind,Mar 2018,"""Will machines replace humans?"" This question is on the mind of anyone with a job to lose. Daniel Susskind confronts this question and three misconceptions we have about our automated future, suggesting we ask something else: How will we distribute wealth in a world when there will be less -- or even no -- work?", (49K),"Transcript (18 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtČeštinaРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:00Automation anxiety
has been spreading lately, a fear that in the future, many jobs will be performed by machines rather than human beings, given the remarkable advances
that are unfolding in artificial intelligence and robotics. What's clear is that
there will be significant change. What's less clear
is what that change will look like. My research suggests that the future
is both troubling and exciting. The threat of technological
unemployment is real, and yet it's a good problem to have. And to explain
how I came to that conclusion, I want to confront three myths that I think are currently obscuring
our vision of this automated future. 00:44A picture that we see
on our television screens, in books, in films, in everyday commentary is one where an army of robots
descends on the workplace with one goal in mind: to displace human beings from their work. And I call this the Terminator myth. Yes, machines displace
human beings from particular tasks, but they don't just
substitute for human beings. They also complement them in other tasks, making that work more valuable
and more important. Sometimes they complement
human beings directly, making them more productive
or more efficient at a particular task. So a taxi driver can use a satnav system
to navigate on unfamiliar roads. An architect can use
computer-assisted design software to design bigger,
more complicated buildings. 01:30But technological progress doesn't
just complement human beings directly. It also complements them indirectly,
and it does this in two ways. The first is if we think
of the economy as a pie, technological progress
makes the pie bigger. As productivity increases,
incomes rise and demand grows. The British pie, for instance, is more than a hundred times
the size it was 300 years ago. And so people displaced
from tasks in the old pie could find tasks to do
in the new pie instead. But technological progress
doesn't just make the pie bigger. It also changes
the ingredients in the pie. As time passes, people spend
their income in different ways, changing how they spread it
across existing goods, and developing tastes
for entirely new goods, too. New industries are created, new tasks have to be done and that means often
new roles have to be filled. So again, the British pie: 300 years ago,
most people worked on farms, 150 years ago, in factories, and today, most people work in offices. And once again, people displaced
from tasks in the old bit of pie could tumble into tasks
in the new bit of pie instead. 02:40Economists call these effects
complementarities, but really that's just a fancy word
to capture the different way that technological progress
helps human beings. Resolving this Terminator myth shows us that there are
two forces at play: one, machine substitution
that harms workers, but also these complementarities
that do the opposite. 03:01Now the second myth, what I call the intelligence myth. What do the tasks of driving a car,
making a medical diagnosis and identifying a bird
at a fleeting glimpse have in common? Well, these are all tasks
that until very recently, leading economists thought
couldn't readily be automated. And yet today, all of these tasks
can be automated. You know, all major car manufacturers
have driverless car programs. There's countless systems out there
that can diagnose medical problems. And there's even an app
that can identify a bird at a fleeting glimpse. 03:36Now, this wasn't simply a case of bad luck
on the part of economists. They were wrong, and the reason why
they were wrong is very important. They've fallen for the intelligence myth, the belief that machines
have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to outperform them. When these economists
were trying to figure out what tasks machines could not do, they imagined the only way
to automate a task was to sit down with a human being, get them to explain to you
how it was they performed a task, and then try and capture that explanation in a set of instructions
for a machine to follow. This view was popular in artificial
intelligence at one point, too. I know this because Richard Susskind, who is my dad and my coauthor, wrote his doctorate in the 1980s
on artificial intelligence and the law at Oxford University, and he was part of the vanguard. And with a professor called Phillip Capper and a legal publisher called Butterworths, they produced the world's first
commercially available artificial intelligence system in the law. This was the home screen design. He assures me this was
a cool screen design at the time. 04:46(Laughter) 04:47I've never been entirely convinced. He published it
in the form of two floppy disks, at a time where floppy disks
genuinely were floppy, and his approach was the same
as the economists': sit down with a lawyer, get her to explain to you
how it was she solved a legal problem, and then try and capture that explanation
in a set of rules for a machine to follow. In economics, if human beings
could explain themselves in this way, the tasks are called routine,
and they could be automated. But if human beings
can't explain themselves, the tasks are called non-routine,
and they're thought to be out reach. Today, that routine-nonroutine
distinction is widespread. Think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks
that are predictable or repetitive, rules-based or well-defined. Those are all just
different words for routine. And go back to those three cases
that I mentioned at the start. Those are all classic cases
of nonroutine tasks. Ask a doctor, for instance,
how she makes a medical diagnosis, and she might be able
to give you a few rules of thumb, but ultimately she'd struggle. She'd say it requires things like
creativity and judgment and intuition. And these things are
very difficult to articulate, and so it was thought these tasks
would be very hard to automate. If a human being can't explain themselves, where on earth do we begin
in writing a set of instructions for a machine to follow? 06:06Thirty years ago, this view was right, but today it's looking shaky, and in the future
it's simply going to be wrong. Advances in processing power,
in data storage capability and in algorithm design mean that this
routine-nonroutine distinction is diminishingly useful. 06:22To see this, go back to the case
of making a medical diagnosis. Earlier in the year, a team of researchers at Stanford
announced they'd developed a system which can tell you
whether or not a freckle is cancerous as accurately as leading dermatologists. How does it work? It's not trying to copy the judgment
or the intuition of a doctor. It knows or understands
nothing about medicine at all. Instead, it's running
a pattern recognition algorithm through 129,450 past cases, hunting for similarities
between those cases and the particular lesion in question. It's performing these tasks
in an unhuman way, based on the analysis
of more possible cases than any doctor could hope
to review in their lifetime. It didn't matter that that human being, that doctor, couldn't explain
how she'd performed the task. 07:13Now, there are those
who dwell upon that the fact that these machines
aren't built in our image. As an example, take IBM's Watson, the supercomputer that went
on the US quiz show ""Jeopardy!"" in 2011, and it beat the two
human champions at ""Jeopardy!"" The day after it won, The Wall Street Journal ran a piece
by the philosopher John Searle with the title ""Watson
Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!'"" Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true. You know, Watson didn't
let out a cry of excitement. It didn't call up its parents
to say what a good job it had done. It didn't go down to the pub for a drink. This system wasn't trying to copy the way
that those human contestants played, but it didn't matter. It still outperformed them. 07:54Resolving the intelligence myth shows us that our limited understanding
about human intelligence, about how we think and reason, is far less of a constraint
on automation than it was in the past. What's more, as we've seen, when these machines
perform tasks differently to human beings, there's no reason to think that what human beings
are currently capable of doing represents any sort of summit in what these machines
might be capable of doing in the future. 08:19Now the third myth, what I call the superiority myth. It's often said that those who forget about the helpful side
of technological progress, those complementarities from before, are committing something
known as the lump of labor fallacy. Now, the problem is
the lump of labor fallacy is itself a fallacy, and I call this the lump
of labor fallacy fallacy, or LOLFF, for short. Let me explain. The lump of labor fallacy
is a very old idea. It was a British economist, David Schloss,
who gave it this name in 1892. He was puzzled
to come across a dock worker who had begun to use
a machine to make washers, the small metal discs
that fasten on the end of screws. And this dock worker
felt guilty for being more productive. Now, most of the time,
we expect the opposite, that people feel guilty
for being unproductive, you know, a little too much time
on Facebook or Twitter at work. But this worker felt guilty
for being more productive, and asked why, he said,
""I know I'm doing wrong. I'm taking away the work of another man."" In his mind, there was
some fixed lump of work to be divided up between him and his pals, so that if he used
this machine to do more, there'd be less left for his pals to do. Schloss saw the mistake. The lump of work wasn't fixed. As this worker used the machine
and became more productive, the price of washers would fall,
demand for washers would rise, more washers would have to be made, and there'd be more work
for his pals to do. The lump of work would get bigger. Schloss called this
""the lump of labor fallacy."" 09:48And today you hear people talk
about the lump of labor fallacy to think about the future
of all types of work. There's no fixed lump of work
out there to be divided up between people and machines. Yes, machines substitute for human beings,
making the original lump of work smaller, but they also complement human beings, and the lump of work
gets bigger and changes. 10:07But LOLFF. Here's the mistake: it's right to think
that technological progress makes the lump of work to be done bigger. Some tasks become more valuable.
New tasks have to be done. But it's wrong to think that necessarily, human beings will be best placed
to perform those tasks. And this is the superiority myth. Yes, the lump of work
might get bigger and change, but as machines become more capable, it's likely that they'll take on
the extra lump of work themselves. Technological progress,
rather than complement human beings, complements machines instead. 10:40To see this, go back
to the task of driving a car. Today, satnav systems
directly complement human beings. They make some
human beings better drivers. But in the future, software is going to displace
human beings from the driving seat, and these satnav systems,
rather than complement human beings, will simply make these
driverless cars more efficient, helping the machines instead. Or go to those indirect complementarities
that I mentioned as well. The economic pie may get larger, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that any new demand
will fall on goods that machines, rather than human beings,
are best placed to produce. The economic pie may change, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that they'll be best placed
to do the new tasks that have to be done. In short, demand for tasks
isn't demand for human labor. Human beings only stand to benefit if they retain the upper hand
in all these complemented tasks, but as machines become more capable,
that becomes less likely. 11:38So what do these three myths tell us then? Well, resolving the Terminator myth shows us that the future of work depends
upon this balance between two forces: one, machine substitution
that harms workers but also those complementarities
that do the opposite. And until now, this balance
has fallen in favor of human beings. But resolving the intelligence myth shows us that that first force,
machine substitution, is gathering strength. Machines, of course, can't do everything, but they can do far more, encroaching ever deeper into the realm
of tasks performed by human beings. What's more, there's no reason to think that what human beings
are currently capable of represents any sort of finishing line, that machines are going
to draw to a polite stop once they're as capable as us. Now, none of this matters so long as those helpful
winds of complementarity blow firmly enough, but resolving the superiority myth shows us that that process
of task encroachment not only strengthens
the force of machine substitution, but it wears down
those helpful complementarities too. Bring these three myths together and I think we can capture a glimpse
of that troubling future. Machines continue to become more capable, encroaching ever deeper
on tasks performed by human beings, strengthening the force
of machine substitution, weakening the force
of machine complementarity. And at some point, that balance
falls in favor of machines rather than human beings. This is the path we're currently on. I say ""path"" deliberately,
because I don't think we're there yet, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion
that this is our direction of travel. 13:12That's the troubling part. Let me say now why I think actually
this is a good problem to have. For most of human history,
one economic problem has dominated: how to make the economic pie
large enough for everyone to live on. Go back to the turn
of the first century AD, and if you took the global economic pie and divided it up into equal slices
for everyone in the world, everyone would get a few hundred dollars. Almost everyone lived
on or around the poverty line. And if you roll forward a thousand years, roughly the same is true. But in the last few hundred years,
economic growth has taken off. Those economic pies have exploded in size. Global GDP per head, the value of those individual
slices of the pie today, they're about 10,150 dollars. If economic growth continues
at two percent, our children will be twice as rich as us. If it continues
at a more measly one percent, our grandchildren
will be twice as rich as us. By and large, we've solved
that traditional economic problem. 14:12Now, technological unemployment,
if it does happen, in a strange way will be
a symptom of that success, will have solved one problem --
how to make the pie bigger -- but replaced it with another -- how to make sure
that everyone gets a slice. As other economists have noted,
solving this problem won't be easy. Today, for most people, their job is their seat
at the economic dinner table, and in a world with less work
or even without work, it won't be clear
how they get their slice. There's a great deal
of discussion, for instance, about various forms
of universal basic income as one possible approach, and there's trials underway in the United States
and in Finland and in Kenya. And this is the collective challenge
that's right in front of us, to figure out how this material prosperity
generated by our economic system can be enjoyed by everyone in a world in which
our traditional mechanism for slicing up the pie, the work that people do, withers away and perhaps disappears. 15:10Solving this problem is going to require
us to think in very different ways. There's going to be a lot of disagreement
about what ought to be done, but it's important to remember
that this is a far better problem to have than the one that haunted
our ancestors for centuries: how to make that pie
big enough in the first place. 15:29Thank you very much. 15:30(Applause)"

we don't seem like we're a couple of middle-aged boring men. I said, I'm flattered by that -- (Laughter) — because I'm a bit older, and he has a bit more net worth than I do. 00:28Larry Page: Well, thank you. 00:30CR: So we'll have a conversation about the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google, and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy, and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question: Where is Google and where is it going? LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot, and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say, is that really what you guys are still doing? And I always kind of think about that myself, and I'm not quite sure. But actually, when I think about search, it's such a deep thing for all of us, to really understand what you want, to understand the world's information, and we're still very much in the early stages of that, which is totally crazy. We've been at it for 15 years already, but it's not at all done. 01:36CR: When it's done, how will it be? 01:39LP: Well, I guess, in thinking about where we're going -- you know, why is it not done? -- a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know, your computer
doesn't know where you are, it doesn't know what you're doing, it doesn't know what you know, and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work, make them understand your context. Google Now, you know, knows where you are, knows what you may need. So really having computing 
work and understand you and understand that information, we really haven't done that yet. It's still very, very clunky. 02:17CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing, where does Deep Mind fit? 02:22LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First, let me tell you the way we got there, which was looking at search and really understanding, trying to understand everything, and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you -- like, voice was really important. So what's the state of the art 
on speech recognition? It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube? But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself. Now, that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are, that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind, what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually -- they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games, and really just, maybe I can show the video, just playing video games, and learning how to do that automatically. 03:36CR: Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. 03:43LP: The amazing thing about this is this is, I mean, obviously, these are old games, but the system just sees what you see, the pixels, and it has the controls and it has the score, and it's learned to play all of these games, same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing, and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left, and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule, or your information needs, or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that, and that's what I'm really excited about. 04:32CR: When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing, also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we, when you look at that? 04:45LP: Well, I think for me, this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company, Demis, has a neuroscience and a
computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. 05:14CR: But where's the level of it now? And how fast do you think we are moving? 05:19LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now, understanding cats on YouTube and things like that, improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally, but I think for me, this example's really exciting, because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. 05:40CR: I don't know if we can do this, but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image? 05:49LP: Yeah.
CR: There it is. Can you see the cat? Designed by machines, seen by machines. 05:53LP: That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training, no notion of a cat, but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand, and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part, it started with search, really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. 06:23(Video) [""Soy, Kenya""] 06:28Zack Matere: Not long ago, I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started
dying one after the other. I checked out the books and 
they didn't tell me much. So, I went and I did a search. [""Zack Matere, Farmer""] Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone, I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information, but there's no follow-up to that. I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge, they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful, but it is how we use it that will define us. 08:18(Applause) 08:22LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video, actually, was we just read about it in the news, and we found this gentlemen, and made that little clip. 08:31CR: When I talk to people about you, they say to me, people who know you well, say, Larry wants to change the world, and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community, and this is an example. LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me, I have been focusing on access more, if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually, two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost-efficiently. 09:19CR: It's a balloon.
LP: Yeah, get access to the Internet. 09:22CR: And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet? Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible, they didn't have to be tethered. 09:32LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation. Like, we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it, but it was just really, how do we get access points up high, cheaply? You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up, and actually again, it's the power of the Internet, I did a search on it, and I found, 30, 40 years ago, someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought, why can't we do that today? And that's how this project got going. 10:10CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind? 10:12LP: Yeah, but it turns out, we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before, and if you control the altitude of the balloons, which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways, you can actually control roughly where they go, and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. 10:33CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation, where you've been a nerd for a while, and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles, let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. 10:51LP: Yeah, absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with
Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think, for me, I guess, privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things, and I think you can't have privacy without security, so let me just talk about security first, because you asked about Snowden and all of that, and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from, but we do need to know what the parameters of it is, what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why, and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. 11:59CR: Never coming to Google to ask for anything. 12:03LP: Not Google, but the public. I think we need to 
have a debate about that, or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. 12:23CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. 12:26LP: Yes. The privacy side, I think it's -- the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you, and that's an important thing, and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit -- I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice, show them what data's being collected -- search history, location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome, and doing that in more ways, just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at, on your show, actually, I kind of lost my voice, and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. 13:28CR: If I could do anything, I would do that. 13:29LP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think, you know what, I look at that, I made that public, and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues, and I look at medical records, and I say, wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors? And when someone accesses your medical record, a research doctor, they could see, you could see which doctor accessed it and why, and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that, we'd save 100,000 lives this year. 14:14CR: Absolutely. Let me go — (Applause) 14:17LP: So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy, we're doing the same thing we're 
doing with medical records, is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. 14:35CR: And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. 14:42LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that, and it was a great thing to do. 14:49CR: And the response has been overwhelming. 14:50LP: Yeah, and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions, which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. 15:00CR: So talking about the future, what is it about you and transportation systems? 15:07LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost, and I just became a bit obsessed
with transportation systems. 15:26CR: And that began the idea of an automated car. 15:29LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about people working on automated cars, and I became fascinated by that, and it takes a while to 
get these projects going, but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's 20 million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under 34 in the U.S. 15:53CR: So you're talking about saving lives. 15:55LP: Yeah, and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads, half of the area, and most cities are not far behind, actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. 16:13CR: And how soon will we be there? 16:16LP: I think we can be there very, very soon. We've driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. 16:29CR: But it's not only you're
talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. 16:33LP: Well at Google, we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone, and that's been amazing, most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere, and the bikes wear out. They're getting used 24 hours a day. 16:47CR: But you want to put them above the street, too. 16:49LP: Well I said, how do we get people using bikes more? 16:52CR: We may have a video here. 16:53LP: Yeah, let's show the video. I just got excited about this. 16:58(Music) So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway, it looks totally crazy, but I was actually thinking about our campus, working with the Zippies and stuff, and just trying to get a lot more bike usage, and I was thinking about, how do you cost-effectively separate the bikes from traffic? And I went and searched, and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this, that particular thing, but it gets your imagination going. 17:36CR: Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy 
of your own mind. You have this idea of [Google X]. You don't simply want to go in some small, measurable arena of progress. 17:51LP: Yeah, I think many of the things we just 
talked about are like that, where they're really -- I almost use the economic concept of additionality, which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless 
you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have, and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed, the more I learn about technology, the more I realize I don't know, and that's because this technological horizon, the thing that you can see to do next, the more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material
that will work for them. 18:40CR: What's interesting about 
you too, though, for me, is that, we have lots of people who are thinking about the future, and they are going and looking
and they're coming back, but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about, Tesla. The principle of that for you is what? 19:00LP: Well, I think invention is not enough. If you invent something, Tesla invented electric power that we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things, where we have an innovation and invention focus, plus the ability to really -- a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that, because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. 19:42CR: Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. 19:51LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did 50 years ago or 20 years ago. That's not really what we need. We need, especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change. 20:13CR: You once said, actually, as I think I've got this about right, that you might consider, rather than giving your money, if you were leaving it to some cause, just simply giving it to Elon Musk, because you had confidence that he would change the future, and that you would therefore — 20:30LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars, he wants to go to Mars, to back up humanity, that's a worthy goal, but it's a company, and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you
want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well? I mean, but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies, and I think it's sad, because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is, where a lot of the money is, and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. 21:22CR: When I close conversations with lots of people, I always ask this question: What state of mind, what quality of mind is it that has served you best? People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity, and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind, as I leave this audience, has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present? 21:49LP: You know, I think the most important thing -- I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong? What did those companies all do wrong? And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think, for me, I just try to focus on that and say, what is that future really going to be and how do we create it, and how do we cause our organization, to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate? And so that's been curiosity, it's been looking at things people might not think about, working on things that no one else is working on, because that's where the additionality really is, and be willing to do that, to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future, right? That was a good thing to be working on. 22:57CR: It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you, and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks, Larry. 23:03LP: Thank you. 23:05(Applause) 23:09CR: Larry Page."
2,How civilization could destroy itself — and 4 ways we could prevent it,Nick Bostrom,Dec 2019,"Humanity is on its way to creating a ""black ball"": a technological breakthrough that could destroy us all, says philosopher Nick Bostrom. In this incisive, surprisingly light-hearted conversation with Head of TED Chris Anderson, Bostrom outlines the vulnerabilities we could face if (or when) our inventions spiral beyond our control -- and explores how we can prevent our future demise.", (77K),"Transcript (16 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01Chris Anderson: Nick Bostrom. So, you have already given us
so many crazy ideas out there. I think a couple of decades ago, you made the case that we might
all be living in a simulation, or perhaps probably were. More recently, you've painted the most vivid examples
of how artificial general intelligence could go horribly wrong. And now this year, you're about to publish a paper that presents something called
the vulnerable world hypothesis. And our job this evening is to
give the illustrated guide to that. So let's do that. What is that hypothesis? 00:40Nick Bostrom: It's trying to think about a sort of structural feature
of the current human condition. You like the urn metaphor, so I'm going to use that to explain it. So picture a big urn filled with balls representing ideas, methods,
possible technologies. You can think of the history
of human creativity as the process of reaching into this urn
and pulling out one ball after another, and the net effect so far
has been hugely beneficial, right? We've extracted a great many white balls, some various shades of gray,
mixed blessings. We haven't so far
pulled out the black ball -- a technology that invariably destroys
the civilization that discovers it. So the paper tries to think
about what could such a black ball be. 01:31CA: So you define that ball as one that would inevitably
bring about civilizational destruction. 01:36NB: Unless we exit what I call
the semi-anarchic default condition. But sort of, by default. 01:44CA: So, you make the case compelling by showing some sort of counterexamples where you believe that so far
we've actually got lucky, that we might have pulled out
that death ball without even knowing it. So there's this quote, what's this quote? 02:00NB: Well, I guess
it's just meant to illustrate the difficulty of foreseeing what basic discoveries will lead to. We just don't have that capability. Because we have become quite good
at pulling out balls, but we don't really have the ability
to put the ball back into the urn, right. We can invent, but we can't un-invent. So our strategy, such as it is, is to hope that there is
no black ball in the urn. 02:26CA: So once it's out, it's out,
and you can't put it back in, and you think we've been lucky. So talk through a couple
of these examples. You talk about different
types of vulnerability. 02:37NB: So the easiest type to understand is a technology
that just makes it very easy to cause massive amounts of destruction. Synthetic biology might be a fecund
source of that kind of black ball, but many other possible things we could -- think of geoengineering,
really great, right? We could combat global warming, but you don't want it
to get too easy either, you don't want any random person
and his grandmother to have the ability to radically
alter the earth's climate. Or maybe lethal autonomous drones, massed-produced, mosquito-sized
killer bot swarms. Nanotechnology,
artificial general intelligence. 03:17CA: You argue in the paper that it's a matter of luck
that when we discovered that nuclear power could create a bomb, it might have been the case that you could have created a bomb with much easier resources,
accessible to anyone. 03:31NB: Yeah, so think back to the 1930s where for the first time we make
some breakthroughs in nuclear physics, some genius figures out that it's possible
to create a nuclear chain reaction and then realizes
that this could lead to the bomb. And we do some more work, it turns out that what you require
to make a nuclear bomb is highly enriched uranium or plutonium, which are very difficult materials to get. You need ultracentrifuges, you need reactors, like,
massive amounts of energy. But suppose it had turned out instead there had been an easy way
to unlock the energy of the atom. That maybe by baking sand
in the microwave oven or something like that you could have created
a nuclear detonation. So we know that that's
physically impossible. But before you did the relevant physics how could you have known
how it would turn out? 04:20CA: Although, couldn't you argue that for life to evolve on Earth that implied sort of stable environment, that if it was possible to create
massive nuclear reactions relatively easy, the Earth would never have been stable, that we wouldn't be here at all. 04:35NB: Yeah, unless there were something
that is easy to do on purpose but that wouldn't happen by random chance. So, like things we can easily do, we can stack 10 blocks
on top of one another, but in nature, you're not going to find,
like, a stack of 10 blocks. 04:48CA: OK, so this is probably the one that many of us worry about most, and yes, synthetic biology
is perhaps the quickest route that we can foresee
in our near future to get us here. 04:58NB: Yeah, and so think
about what that would have meant if, say, anybody by working
in their kitchen for an afternoon could destroy a city. It's hard to see how
modern civilization as we know it could have survived that. Because in any population
of a million people, there will always be some
who would, for whatever reason, choose to use that destructive power. So if that apocalyptic residual would choose to destroy a city, or worse, then cities would get destroyed. 05:26CA: So here's another type
of vulnerability. Talk about this. 05:30NB: Yeah, so in addition to these
kind of obvious types of black balls that would just make it possible
to blow up a lot of things, other types would act
by creating bad incentives for humans to do things that are harmful. So, the Type-2a, we might call it that, is to think about some technology
that incentivizes great powers to use their massive amounts of force
to create destruction. So, nuclear weapons were actually
very close to this, right? What we did, we spent
over 10 trillion dollars to build 70,000 nuclear warheads and put them on hair-trigger alert. And there were several times
during the Cold War we almost blew each other up. It's not because a lot of people felt
this would be a great idea, let's all spend 10 trillion dollars
to blow ourselves up, but the incentives were such
that we were finding ourselves -- this could have been worse. Imagine if there had been
a safe first strike. Then it might have been very tricky, in a crisis situation, to refrain from launching
all their nuclear missiles. If nothing else, because you would fear
that the other side might do it. 06:36CA: Right, mutual assured destruction kept the Cold War relatively stable, without that, we might not be here now. 06:42NB: It could have been
more unstable than it was. And there could be
other properties of technology. It could have been harder
to have arms treaties, if instead of nuclear weapons there had been some smaller thing
or something less distinctive. 06:54CA: And as well as bad incentives
for powerful actors, you also worry about bad incentives
for all of us, in Type-2b here. 07:00NB: Yeah, so, here we might
take the case of global warming. There are a lot of little conveniences that cause each one of us to do things that individually 
have no significant effect, right? But if billions of people do it, cumulatively, it has a damaging effect. Now, global warming
could have been a lot worse than it is. So we have the climate
sensitivity parameter, right. It's a parameter that says
how much warmer does it get if you emit a certain amount
of greenhouse gases. But, suppose that it had been the case that with the amount
of greenhouse gases we emitted, instead of the temperature rising by, say, between three and 4.5 degrees by 2100, suppose it had been
15 degrees or 20 degrees. Like, then we might have been
in a very bad situation. Or suppose that renewable energy
had just been a lot harder to do. Or that there had been
more fossil fuels in the ground. 07:52CA: Couldn't you argue
that if in that case of -- if what we are doing today had resulted in 10 degrees difference
in the time period that we could see, actually humanity would have got
off its ass and done something about it. We're stupid, but we're not
maybe that stupid. Or maybe we are. 08:09NB: I wouldn't bet on it. 08:10(Laughter) 08:13You could imagine other features. So, right now, it's a little bit difficult
to switch to renewables and stuff, right, but it can be done. But it might just have been,
with slightly different physics, it could have been much more expensive
to do these things. 08:28CA: And what's your view, Nick? Do you think, putting
these possibilities together, that this earth, humanity that we are, we count as a vulnerable world? That there is a death ball in our future? 08:43NB: It's hard to say. I mean, I think there might
well be various black balls in the urn, that's what it looks like. There might also be some golden balls that would help us
protect against black balls. And I don't know which order
they will come out. 09:00CA: I mean, one possible
philosophical critique of this idea is that it implies a view
that the future is essentially settled. That there either
is that ball there or it's not. And in a way, that's not a view of the future
that I want to believe. I want to believe
that the future is undetermined, that our decisions today will determine what kind of balls
we pull out of that urn. 09:25NB: I mean, if we just keep inventing, like, eventually we will
pull out all the balls. I mean, I think there's a kind
of weak form of technological determinism that is quite plausible, like, you're unlikely
to encounter a society that uses flint axes and jet planes. But you can almost think
of a technology as a set of affordances. So technology is the thing
that enables us to do various things and achieve various effects in the world. How we'd then use that,
of course depends on human choice. But if we think about these
three types of vulnerability, they make quite weak assumptions
about how we would choose to use them. So a Type-1 vulnerability, again,
this massive, destructive power, it's a fairly weak assumption to think that in a population
of millions of people there would be some that would choose
to use it destructively. 10:12CA: For me, the most single
disturbing argument is that we actually might have
some kind of view into the urn that makes it actually
very likely that we're doomed. Namely, if you believe
in accelerating power, that technology inherently accelerates, that we build the tools
that make us more powerful, then at some point you get to a stage where a single individual
can take us all down, and then it looks like we're screwed. Isn't that argument quite alarming? 10:44NB: Ah, yeah. 10:46(Laughter) 10:48I think -- Yeah, we get more and more power, and [it's] easier and easier 
to use those powers, but we can also invent technologies
that kind of help us control how people use those powers. 11:02CA: So let's talk about that,
let's talk about the response. Suppose that thinking
about all the possibilities that are out there now -- it's not just synbio,
it's things like cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence, etc., etc. -- that there might be
serious doom in our future. What are the possible responses? And you've talked about
four possible responses as well. 11:27NB: Restricting technological development
doesn't seem promising, if we are talking about a general halt
to technological progress. I think neither feasible, nor would it be desirable
even if we could do it. I think there might be very limited areas where maybe you would want
slower technological progress. You don't, I think, want
faster progress in bioweapons, or in, say, isotope separation, that would make it easier to create nukes. 11:52CA: I mean, I used to be
fully on board with that. But I would like to actually
push back on that for a minute. Just because, first of all, if you look at the history
of the last couple of decades, you know, it's always been
push forward at full speed, it's OK, that's our only choice. But if you look at globalization
and the rapid acceleration of that, if you look at the strategy of
""move fast and break things"" and what happened with that, and then you look at the potential
for synthetic biology, I don't know that we should
move forward rapidly or without any kind of restriction to a world where you could have
a DNA printer in every home and high school lab. There are some restrictions, right? 12:34NB: Possibly, there is
the first part, the not feasible. If you think it would be
desirable to stop it, there's the problem of feasibility. So it doesn't really help
if one nation kind of -- 12:44CA: No, it doesn't help
if one nation does, but we've had treaties before. That's really how we survived
the nuclear threat, was by going out there and going through
the painful process of negotiating. I just wonder whether the logic isn't
that we, as a matter of global priority, we shouldn't go out there and try, like, now start negotiating
really strict rules on where synthetic bioresearch is done, that it's not something
that you want to democratize, no? 13:12NB: I totally agree with that -- that it would be desirable, for example, maybe to have DNA synthesis machines, not as a product where each lab
has their own device, but maybe as a service. Maybe there could be
four or five places in the world where you send in your digital blueprint
and the DNA comes back, right? And then, you would have the ability, if one day it really looked
like it was necessary, we would have like,
a finite set of choke points. So I think you want to look
for kind of special opportunities, where you could have tighter control. 13:45CA: Your belief is, fundamentally, we are not going to be successful
in just holding back. Someone, somewhere --
North Korea, you know -- someone is going to go there
and discover this knowledge, if it's there to be found. 13:57NB: That looks plausible
under current conditions. It's not just synthetic biology, either. I mean, any kind of profound,
new change in the world could turn out to be a black ball. 14:05CA: Let's look at 
another possible response. 14:07NB: This also, I think,
has only limited potential. So, with the Type-1 vulnerability again, I mean, if you could reduce the number
of people who are incentivized to destroy the world, if only they could get
access and the means, that would be good. 14:22CA: In this image that you asked us to do you're imagining these drones
flying around the world with facial recognition. When they spot someone
showing signs of sociopathic behavior, they shower them with love, they fix them. 14:33NB: I think it's like a hybrid picture. Eliminate can either mean,
like, incarcerate or kill, or it can mean persuade them
to a better view of the world. But the point is that, suppose you were
extremely successful in this, and you reduced the number
of such individuals by half. And if you want to do it by persuasion, you are competing against
all other powerful forces that are trying to persuade people, parties, religion, education system. But suppose you could reduce it by half, I don't think the risk
would be reduced by half. Maybe by five or 10 percent. 15:03CA: You're not recommending that we gamble
humanity's future on response two. 15:08NB: I think it's all good
to try to deter and persuade people, but we shouldn't rely on that
as our only safeguard. 15:14CA: How about three? 15:15NB: I think there are two general methods that we could use to achieve
the ability to stabilize the world against the whole spectrum
of possible vulnerabilities. And we probably would need both. So, one is an extremely effective ability to do preventive policing. Such that you could intercept. If anybody started to do
this dangerous thing, you could intercept them
in real time, and stop them. So this would require
ubiquitous surveillance, everybody would be monitored all the time. 15:46CA: This is ""Minority Report,""
essentially, a form of. 15:48NB: You would have maybe AI algorithms, big freedom centers
that were reviewing this, etc., etc. 15:56CA: You know that mass surveillance
is not a very popular term right now? 16:01(Laughter) 16:03NB: Yeah, so this little device there, imagine that kind of necklace
that you would have to wear at all times with multidirectional cameras. But, to make it go down better, just call it the ""freedom tag""
or something like that. 16:16(Laughter) 16:18CA: OK. I mean, this is the conversation, friends, this is why this is
such a mind-blowing conversation. 16:25NB: Actually, there's
a whole big conversation on this on its own, obviously. There are huge problems and risks
with that, right? We may come back to that. So the other, the final, the other general stabilization capability is kind of plugging
another governance gap. So the surveillance would be kind of
governance gap at the microlevel, like, preventing anybody
from ever doing something highly illegal. Then, there's a corresponding
governance gap at the macro level, at the global level. You would need the ability, reliably, to prevent the worst kinds
of global coordination failures, to avoid wars between great powers, arms races, cataclysmic commons problems, in order to deal with
the Type-2a vulnerabilities. 17:11CA: Global governance is a term that's definitely way out
of fashion right now, but could you make the case
that throughout history, the history of humanity is that at every stage
of technological power increase, people have reorganized
and sort of centralized the power. So, for example,
when a roving band of criminals could take over a society, the response was,
well, you have a nation-state and you centralize force,
a police force or an army, so, ""No, you can't do that."" The logic, perhaps, of having
a single person or a single group able to take out humanity means at some point
we're going to have to go this route, at least in some form, no? 17:50NB: It's certainly true that the scale
of political organization has increased over the course of human history. It used to be hunter-gatherer band, right, and then chiefdom, city-states, nations, now there are international organizations
and so on and so forth. Again, I just want to make sure I get the chance to stress that obviously there are huge downsides and indeed, massive risks, both to mass surveillance
and to global governance. I'm just pointing out
that if we are lucky, the world could be such
that these would be the only ways you could survive a black ball. 18:22CA: The logic of this theory, it seems to me, is that we've got to recognize
we can't have it all. That the sort of, I would say, naive dream
that many of us had that technology is always
going to be a force for good, keep going, don't stop,
go as fast as you can and not pay attention
to some of the consequences, that's actually just not an option. We can have that. If we have that, we're going to have to accept some of these other
very uncomfortable things with it, and kind of be in this
arms race with ourselves of, you want the power,
you better limit it, you better figure out how to limit it. 19:00NB: I think it is an option, a very tempting option,
it's in a sense the easiest option and it might work, but it means we are fundamentally
vulnerable to extracting a black ball. Now, I think with a bit of coordination, like, if you did solve this
macrogovernance problem, and the microgovernance problem, then we could extract
all the balls from the urn and we'd benefit greatly. 19:24CA: I mean, if we're living
in a simulation, does it matter? We just reboot. 19:29(Laughter) 19:30NB: Then ... I ... 19:32(Laughter) I didn't see that one coming. 19:38CA: So what's your view? Putting all the pieces together,
how likely is it that we're doomed? 19:44(Laughter) 19:47I love how people laugh
when you ask that question. 19:49NB: On an individual level, we seem to kind of be doomed anyway,
just with the time line, we're rotting and aging
and all kinds of things, right? 19:57(Laughter) 19:58It's actually a little bit tricky. If you want to set up
so that you can attach a probability, first, who are we? If you're very old,
probably you'll die of natural causes, if you're very young,
you might have a 100-year -- the probability might depend
on who you ask. Then the threshold, like, what counts
as civilizational devastation? In the paper I don't require
an existential catastrophe in order for it to count. This is just a definitional matter, I say a billion dead, or a reduction of world GDP by 50 percent, but depending on what
you say the threshold is, you get a different probability estimate. But I guess you could
put me down as a frightened optimist. 20:37(Laughter) 20:38CA: You're a frightened optimist, and I think you've just created
a large number of other frightened ... people. 20:45(Laughter) 20:46NB: In the simulation. 20:48CA: In a simulation. Nick Bostrom, your mind amazes me, thank you so much for scaring
the living daylights out of us. 20:54(Applause)"
2,The line between life and not-life,Martin Hanczyc,Nov 2011,"In his lab, Martin Hanczyc makes ""protocells,"" experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells. His work demonstrates how life might have first occurred on Earth ... and perhaps elsewhere too.", (26K),"Transcript (30 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side, and living systems on the other side. So we go from, say, this beautiful and complex crystal as non-life, and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side. Over the last hundred and fifty years or so, science has kind of blurred this distinction between non-living and living systems, and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. We'll just take one example here: a virus is a natural system, right? But it's very simple. It's very simplistic. It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements, it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to, say, reproduce and evolve. 00:47But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory, mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures, and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. Really what I'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life. 01:08So what are these characteristics that I'm talking about? These are them. We consider first that life has a body. Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment. Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. Life also has a kind of inheritable information. Now we, as humans, we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate, and if we coupled these now to inheritable information, we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve. And so these are the things we will try to do in the lab, make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life. 01:57So how do we do this? Well, we use a model system that we term a protocell. You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell, and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together, play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive. In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same, but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike. And so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems. Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a kind of synthetic biology: ""The synthesis of life, should it ever occur, will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea."" That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories, it's probably not going to impact our lives at all. 02:53""If we accept the theory of evolution, then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world, or between the non-living and living world, forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life"" -- so, the ones I just discussed -- ""to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment."" So we start simple, we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life, and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike. This is how we can start to make a protocell. We use this idea called self-assembly. What that means is, I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab, and these chemicals will start to self-associate to form larger and larger structures. So say on the order of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn't exist before. And in this particular example, what I took is some membrane molecules, mixed those together in the right environment, and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here. These membranes are also quite similar, morphologically and functionally, to the membranes in your body, and we can use these, as they say, to form the body of our protocell. 04:03Likewise, we can work with oil and water systems. As you know, when you put oil and water together, they don't mix, but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form, and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell, as you will see later. So that's just forming some body stuff, right? Some architectures. What about the other aspects of living systems? So we came up with this protocell model here that I'm showing. We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite. This is natural from the environment, this clay. It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active. It could run a metabolism on it. Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red -- this is a relative of DNA, it's an informational molecule -- it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay. This structure, then, can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself, so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself, and that's shown in green here on this micrograph. So just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right? 05:11So we're on a road towards living systems. But if you saw this protocell, you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms, it doesn't really do anything. So, something is missing. Some things are missing. So some things that are missing is, for example, if you had a flow of energy through a system, what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself, much like living systems do. So we came up with a different protocell model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one. In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet, but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something, to actually become dynamic, as we'll see here. You add the droplet to the system. It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system. Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. 06:10As we heard earlier, movement is very important in these kinds of living systems. It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system trying to preserve itself. We take this same moving protocell here, and we put it in another experiment, get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system, and you'll see that in blue here, right? So I add some food source to the system. The protocell moves. It encounters the food. It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there. Alright? So not only do we have this system that has a body, it has a metabolism, it can use energy, it moves around. It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. 07:00Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. If we count the number of chemicals in that system, actually, including the water that's in the dish, we have five chemicals that can do this. So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do, and depending on the conditions, we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. On the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other, and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other. Right? So not only do individual protocells have behavior, what we've interpreted as behavior in this system, but we also have basically population-level behavior similar to what organisms have. So now that you're all experts on protocells, we're going to play a game with these protocells. We're going to make two different kinds. Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry inside that, when activated, the protocell starts to vibrate around, just dancing. So remember, these are primitive things, so dancing protocells, that's very interesting to us. (Laughter) 08:06The second protocell has a different chemistry inside, and when activated, the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one. Right? And we just put these two together in the same system. So there's population A, there's population B, and then we activate the system, and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones, they all come together. They fuse together to form one big blob, and the other protocell just dances around. And this just happens until all of the energy in the system is basically used up, and then, game over. So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times, and one time something very interesting happened. So, I added these protocells together to the system, and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB. That didn't happen before. There it goes. There's a protocell AB now in this system. Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit, while protocell B does the fusing, okay? 09:00But then something even more interesting happens. Watch when these two large protocells, the hybrid ones, fuse together. Now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter) Just with blobs of chemicals, again. So the way this works is, you have a simple system of five chemicals here, a simple system here. When they hybridize, you then form something that's different than before, it's more complex than before, and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. 09:32So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like, interesting colors and interesting behaviors, and they're very easy to make, and they have interesting lifelike properties, perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step, one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth. Certainly, there were molecules present on the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and I showed in these experiments. Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff, because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds. Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay? And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully characterize, even by modern methods, and the product looks brown, like this tar here on the left. A pure compound is shown on the right, for contrast. 10:21So this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen, you put them in a pan, and you apply energy. You turn up the heat, you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar, forming a brownish caramel, right? If you let that go unregulated, you'll continue to make and break chemical bonds, forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's difficult to wash out. So that's what the origin of life would have looked like. You needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early Earth, four, 4.5 billion years ago. So the challenge then is, throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab, and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze. 11:02So we're able to then see the self-assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we've seen previously, and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse, very complex, organic black tar. And we put them into one of these experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then we watch lively movement that comes out. They look really good, very nice movement, and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other, similar to what we've seen before -- but again, working with just primordial conditions, no pure chemicals. These are also, these tar-fueled protocells, are also able to locate resources in their environment. I'm going to add some resource from the left, here, that defuses into the system, and you can see, they really like that. They become very energetic, and able to find the resource in the environment, similar to what we saw before. But again, these are done in these primordial conditions, really messy conditions, not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. These are very dirty little protocells, as a matter of fact. (Laughter) But they have lifelike properties, is the point. 12:05So, doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-living and living systems. And not only that, but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there -- life that could be very different from life that we find here on Earth. And that leads me to the next term, which is ""weird life."" This is a term by Steve Benner. This is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the National Research Council in the United States, wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay, especially if that life is very different from life on Earth. If we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there, how could we even recognize it as life? 12:51Well, they came up with three very general criteria. First is -- and they're listed here. The first is, the system has to be in non-equilibrium. That means the system cannot be dead, in a matter of fact. Basically what that means is, you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself. This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth, driving photosynthesis, driving the ecosystem. Without the Sun, there's likely to be no life on this planet. Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form, so that means even if we had some interesting structures, interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid, then this is not a good place for life. And thirdly, we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds. And again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain itself. 13:37Now today, I told you about very strange and weird protocells -- some that contain clay, some that have primordial ooze in them, some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them. Most of these don't contain DNA, but yet they have lifelike properties. But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems. So by making these chemical, artificial life experiments, we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet, but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe. Thank you. (Applause)"

Lee Sedol is one of the world's
greatest Go players, and he's having what my friends
in Silicon Valley call a ""Holy Cow"" moment -- 00:10(Laughter) 00:11a moment where we realize that AI is actually progressing
a lot faster than we expected. So humans have lost on the Go board.
What about the real world? 00:21footnotefootnoteWell, the real world is much bigger, much more complicated than the Go board. It's a lot less visible, but it's still a decision problem. And if we think about some
of the technologies that are coming down the pike ... Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading
is not yet happening in machines, at least with understanding. But that will happen, and when that happens, very soon afterwards, machines will have read everything
that the human race has ever written. And that will enable machines, along with the ability to look
further ahead than humans can, as we've already seen in Go, if they also have access
to more information, they'll be able to make better decisions
in the real world than we can. So is that a good thing? Well, I hope so. 01:14Our entire civilization,
everything that we value, is based on our intelligence. And if we had access
to a lot more intelligence, then there's really no limit
to what the human race can do. And I think this could be,
as some people have described it, the biggest event in human history. So why are people saying things like this, that AI might spell the end
of the human race? Is this a new thing? Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates
and Stephen Hawking? 01:49Actually, no. This idea
has been around for a while. Here's a quotation: ""Even if we could keep the machines
in a subservient position, for instance, by turning off the power
at strategic moments"" -- and I'll come back to that
""turning off the power"" idea later on -- ""we should, as a species,
feel greatly humbled."" So who said this?
This is Alan Turing in 1951. Alan Turing, as you know,
is the father of computer science and in many ways,
the father of AI as well. So if we think about this problem, the problem of creating something
more intelligent than your own species, we might call this ""the gorilla problem,"" because gorillas' ancestors did this
a few million years ago, and now we can ask the gorillas: Was this a good idea? 02:37So here they are having a meeting
to discuss whether it was a good idea, and after a little while,
they conclude, no, this was a terrible idea. Our species is in dire straits. In fact, you can see the existential
sadness in their eyes. 02:52(Laughter) 02:54So this queasy feeling that making
something smarter than your own species is maybe not a good idea -- what can we do about that? Well, really nothing,
except stop doing AI, and because of all
the benefits that I mentioned and because I'm an AI researcher, I'm not having that. I actually want to be able
to keep doing AI. 03:18So we actually need to nail down
the problem a bit more. What exactly is the problem? Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe? 03:27So here's another quotation: ""We had better be quite sure
that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire."" This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, shortly after he watched
one of the very early learning systems learn to play checkers
better than its creator. But this could equally have been said by King Midas. King Midas said, ""I want everything
I touch to turn to gold,"" and he got exactly what he asked for. That was the purpose
that he put into the machine, so to speak, and then his food and his drink
and his relatives turned to gold and he died in misery and starvation. So we'll call this
""the King Midas problem"" of stating an objective
which is not, in fact, truly aligned with what we want. In modern terms, we call this
""the value alignment problem."" 04:25Putting in the wrong objective
is not the only part of the problem. There's another part. If you put an objective into a machine, even something as simple as,
""Fetch the coffee,"" the machine says to itself, ""Well, how might I fail
to fetch the coffee? Someone might switch me off. OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. I will disable my 'off' switch. I will do anything to defend myself
against interference with this objective
that I have been given."" So this single-minded pursuit in a very defensive mode
of an objective that is, in fact, not aligned with the true objectives
of the human race -- that's the problem that we face. And in fact, that's the high-value
takeaway from this talk. If you want to remember one thing, it's that you can't fetch
the coffee if you're dead. 05:16(Laughter) 05:17It's very simple. Just remember that.
Repeat it to yourself three times a day. 05:21(Laughter) 05:23footnotefootnoteAnd in fact, this is exactly the plot of ""2001: [A Space Odyssey]"" HAL has an objective, a mission, which is not aligned
with the objectives of the humans, and that leads to this conflict. Now fortunately, HAL
is not superintelligent. He's pretty smart,
but eventually Dave outwits him and manages to switch him off. But we might not be so lucky. So what are we going to do? 06:00I'm trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently
pursue objectives. There are three principles involved. The first one is a principle
of altruism, if you like, that the robot's only objective is to maximize the realization
of human objectives, of human values. And by values here I don't mean
touchy-feely, goody-goody values. I just mean whatever it is
that the human would prefer their life to be like. And so this actually violates Asimov's law that the robot has to protect
its own existence. It has no interest in preserving
its existence whatsoever. 06:45The second law is a law
of humility, if you like. And this turns out to be really
important to make robots safe. It says that the robot does not know what those human values are, so it has to maximize them,
but it doesn't know what they are. And that avoids this problem
of single-minded pursuit of an objective. This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. 07:09Now, in order to be useful to us, it has to have some idea of what we want. It obtains that information primarily
by observation of human choices, so our own choices reveal information about what it is that we prefer
our lives to be like. So those are the three principles. Let's see how that applies
to this question of: ""Can you switch the machine off?""
as Turing suggested. 07:37So here's a PR2 robot. This is one that we have in our lab, and it has a big red ""off"" switch
right on the back. The question is: Is it
going to let you switch it off? If we do it the classical way, we give it the objective of, ""Fetch
the coffee, I must fetch the coffee, I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,"" so obviously the PR2
has been listening to my talk, and so it says, therefore,
""I must disable my 'off' switch, and probably taser all the other
people in Starbucks who might interfere with me."" 08:07(Laughter) 08:09So this seems to be inevitable, right? This kind of failure mode
seems to be inevitable, and it follows from having
a concrete, definite objective. 08:18So what happens if the machine
is uncertain about the objective? Well, it reasons in a different way. It says, ""OK, the human
might switch me off, but only if I'm doing something wrong. Well, I don't really know what wrong is, but I know that I don't want to do it."" So that's the first and second
principles right there. ""So I should let the human switch me off."" And in fact you can calculate
the incentive that the robot has to allow the human to switch it off, and it's directly tied to the degree of uncertainty about
the underlying objective. 08:53And then when the machine is switched off, that third principle comes into play. It learns something about the objectives
it should be pursuing, because it learns that
what it did wasn't right. In fact, we can, with suitable use
of Greek symbols, as mathematicians usually do, we can actually prove a theorem that says that such a robot
is provably beneficial to the human. You are provably better off
with a machine that's designed in this way than without it. So this is a very simple example,
but this is the first step in what we're trying to do
with human-compatible AI. 09:30footnotefootnoteNow, this third principle, I think is the one that you're probably
scratching your head over. You're probably thinking, ""Well,
you know, I behave badly. I don't want my robot to behave like me. I sneak down in the middle of the night
and take stuff from the fridge. I do this and that."" There's all kinds of things
you don't want the robot doing. But in fact, it doesn't
quite work that way. Just because you behave badly doesn't mean the robot
is going to copy your behavior. It's going to understand your motivations
and maybe help you resist them, if appropriate. But it's still difficult. What we're trying to do, in fact, is to allow machines to predict
for any person and for any possible life that they could live, and the lives of everybody else: Which would they prefer? And there are many, many
difficulties involved in doing this; I don't expect that this
is going to get solved very quickly. The real difficulties, in fact, are us. 10:32As I have already mentioned,
we behave badly. In fact, some of us are downright nasty. Now the robot, as I said,
doesn't have to copy the behavior. The robot does not have
any objective of its own. It's purely altruistic. And it's not designed just to satisfy
the desires of one person, the user, but in fact it has to respect
the preferences of everybody. So it can deal with a certain
amount of nastiness, and it can even understand
that your nastiness, for example, you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family
and send your kids to school. It can understand that;
it doesn't mean it's going to steal. In fact, it'll just help you
send your kids to school. 11:16We are also computationally limited. Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player, but he still lost. So if we look at his actions,
he took an action that lost the game. That doesn't mean he wanted to lose. So to understand his behavior, we actually have to invert
through a model of human cognition that includes our computational
limitations -- a very complicated model. But it's still something
that we can work on understanding. 11:45Probably the most difficult part,
from my point of view as an AI researcher, is the fact that there are lots of us, and so the machine has to somehow
trade off, weigh up the preferences of many different people, and there are different ways to do that. Economists, sociologists,
moral philosophers have understood that, and we are actively
looking for collaboration. 12:08Let's have a look and see what happens
when you get that wrong. So you can have
a conversation, for example, with your intelligent personal assistant that might be available
in a few years' time. Think of a Siri on steroids. So Siri says, ""Your wife called
to remind you about dinner tonight."" And of course, you've forgotten.
""What? What dinner? What are you talking about?"" 12:30""Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm."" 12:36""I can't do that. I'm meeting
with the secretary-general at 7:30. How could this have happened?"" 12:42""Well, I did warn you, but you overrode
my recommendation."" 12:48""Well, what am I going to do?
I can't just tell him I'm too busy."" 12:52""Don't worry. I arranged
for his plane to be delayed."" 12:55(Laughter) 12:58""Some kind of computer malfunction."" 13:00(Laughter) 13:01""Really? You can do that?"" 13:04""He sends his profound apologies and looks forward to meeting you
for lunch tomorrow."" 13:09(Laughter) 13:10So the values here --
there's a slight mistake going on. This is clearly following my wife's values which is ""Happy wife, happy life."" 13:20(Laughter) 13:21It could go the other way. You could come home
after a hard day's work, and the computer says, ""Long day?"" 13:28""Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch."" 13:30""You must be very hungry."" 13:31""Starving, yeah.
Could you make some dinner?"" 13:36""There's something I need to tell you."" 13:38(Laughter) 13:40""There are humans in South Sudan
who are in more urgent need than you."" 13:45(Laughter) 13:46""So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner."" 13:48(Laughter) 13:50So we have to solve these problems, and I'm looking forward
to working on them. 13:55There are reasons for optimism. One reason is, there is a massive amount of data. Because remember -- I said
they're going to read everything the human race has ever written. Most of what we write about
is human beings doing things and other people getting upset about it. So there's a massive amount
of data to learn from. 14:11There's also a very
strong economic incentive to get this right. So imagine your domestic robot's at home. You're late from work again
and the robot has to feed the kids, and the kids are hungry
and there's nothing in the fridge. And the robot sees the cat. 14:27(Laughter) 14:28And the robot hasn't quite learned
the human value function properly, so it doesn't understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs
the nutritional value of the cat. 14:39(Laughter) 14:40So then what happens? Well, it happens like this: ""Deranged robot cooks kitty
for family dinner."" That one incident would be the end
of the domestic robot industry. So there's a huge incentive
to get this right long before we reach
superintelligent machines. 15:00So to summarize: I'm actually trying to change
the definition of AI so that we have provably
beneficial machines. And the principles are: machines that are altruistic, that want to achieve only our objectives, but that are uncertain
about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is
that we really want. And hopefully in the process,
we will learn to be better people. Thank you very much. 15:27(Applause) 15:30Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart. We're going to stand here a bit
because I think they're setting up for our next speaker. 15:37A couple of questions. So the idea of programming in ignorance
seems intuitively really powerful. As you get to superintelligence, what's going to stop a robot reading literature and discovering
this idea that knowledge is actually better than ignorance and still just shifting its own goals
and rewriting that programming? 15:57Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want
it to learn more, as I said, about our objectives. It'll only become more certain
as it becomes more correct, so the evidence is there and it's going to be designed
to interpret it correctly. It will understand, for example,
that books are very biased in the evidence they contain. They only talk about kings and princes and elite white male people doing stuff. So it's a complicated problem, but as it learns more about our objectives it will become more and more useful to us. 16:34CA: And you couldn't
just boil it down to one law, you know, hardwired in: ""if any human ever tries to switch me off, I comply. I comply."" 16:43SR: Absolutely not. That would be a terrible idea. So imagine that you have
a self-driving car and you want to send your five-year-old off to preschool. Do you want your five-year-old
to be able to switch off the car while it's driving along? Probably not. So it needs to understand how rational
and sensible the person is. The more rational the person, the more willing you are
to be switched off. If the person is completely
random or even malicious, then you're less willing
to be switched off. 17:12CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say, I really, really hope you
figure this out for us. Thank you so much for that talk.
That was amazing. 17:18SR: Thank you. 17:20(Applause)"

Not just one future, but many possible futures, bringing back evidences from those futures
for you to experience today. Like an archaeologist of the future. Over the years, my many journeys
have brought back things like a new species
of synthetically engineered bees; a book named, ""Pets as Protein;"" a machine that makes you rich
by trading your genetic data; a lamp powered by sugar; a computer for growing food. 00:36OK, so I don't actually travel
to different futures -- yet. But my husband Jon and I spend
a lot of time thinking and creating visions
of different futures in our studio. We are constantly looking out
for weak signals, those murmurs of future potential. Then we trace those threads of potential
out into the future, asking: What might it feel like
to live in this future? What might we see, hear and even breathe? Then we run experiments,
build prototypes, make objects, bringing aspects of these futures to life, making them concrete and tangible so you can really feel the impact
of those future possibilities here and now. But this work is not about predictions. It's about creating tools -- tools that can help connect
our present and our future selves so we become active participants
in creating a future we want -- a future that works for all. 01:36footnotefootnoteSo how do we go about doing this? For a recent project called Drone Aviary, we were interested in exploring what it would mean to live
with drones in our cities. Drones that have the power
to see things we can't, to go places we can't and to do so with increasing autonomy. But to understand the technology, getting our hands dirty was crucial. So we built several different
drones in our studio. We gave them names, functions
and then flew them -- but not without difficulty. Things came loose, GPS signals glitched and drones crashed. But it was through such experimentation that we could construct a very
concrete and very experiential slice of one possible future. 02:21So now, let's go to that future. Let's imagine we are living in a city
with drones like this one. We call it The Nightwatchman. It patrols the streets, often spotted
in the evenings and at night. Initially, many of us were annoyed
by its low, dull hum. But then, like everything else,
we got used to it. Now, what if you could see
the world through its eyes? See how it constantly logs
every resident of our neighborhood; logging the kids who play football
in the no-ballgame area and marking them as statutory nuisances. 02:56(Laughter) 02:58And then see how it disperses
this other group, who are teenagers, with the threat of an autonomously
issued injunction. And then there's this giant
floating disc called Madison. Its glaring presence is so overpowering, I can't help but stare at it. But if feels like each time I look at it, it knows a little more about me -- like it keeps flashing all these
Brianair adverts at me, as if it knows about
the holiday I'm planning. I'm not sure if I find this
mildly entertaining or just entirely invasive. 03:33Back to the present. In creating this future, we learned a lot. Not just about how these machines work, but what it would feel like
to live alongside them. Whilst drones like Madison
and Nightwatchman, in these particular forms, are not real yet, most elements of a drone future
are in fact very real today. For instance, facial recognition systems
are everywhere -- in our phones, even in our thermostats and in cameras around our cities -- keeping a record of everything we do, whether it's an advertisement
we glanced at or a protest we attended. These things are here, and we often don't understand
how they work, and what their consequences could be. And we see this all around us. This difficulty in even imagining how the consequences of our actions
today will affect our future. 04:25Last year, where I live, in the UK,
there was a referendum where the people could vote
for the UK to leave the EU or stay in the EU, popularly known as ""Brexit."" And soon after the results came out, a word began to surface
called ""Bregret"" -- 04:39(Laughter) 04:40describing people who chose to vote
for Brexit as a protest, but without thinking through
its potential consequences. And this disconnect is evident
in some of the simplest things. Say you go out for a quick drink. Then you decide
you wouldn't mind a few more. You know you'll wake up
in the morning feeling awful, but you justify it by saying, ""The other me in the future
will deal with that."" But as we find out in the morning, that future ""you"" is you. 05:10When I was growing up in India
in the late '70s and early '80s, there was a feeling that the future both needed to
and could actually be planned. I remember my parents had to plan
for some of the simplest things. When they wanted a telephone in our house, they needed to order it and then wait -- wait for nearly five years before
it got installed in our house. 05:29(Laughter) 05:30And then if they wanted to call
my grandparents who lived in another city, they needed to book
something called a ""trunk call,"" and then wait again,
for hours or even days. And then abruptly, the phone
would ring at two in the morning, and all of us would jump out of our beds
and gather round the phone, shrieking into it,
discussing general well-being at two in the morning. 05:49Today it can feel like things
are happening too fast -- so fast, that it can
become really difficult for us to form an understanding
of our place in history. It creates an overwhelming sense
of uncertainty and anxiety, and so, we let the future
just happen to us. We don't connect with that future ""us."" We treat our future selves as a stranger, and the future as a foreign land. It's not a foreign land; it's unfolding right in front of us, continually being shaped
by our actions today. We are that future, and so I believe fighting
for a future we want is more urgent and necessary
than ever before. 06:28footnotefootnoteWe have learned in our work that one of the most powerful means
of effecting change is when people can directly, tangibly
and emotionally experience some of the future consequences
of their actions today. Earlier this year, the government
of the United Arab Emirates invited us to help them shape
their country's energy strategy all the way up to 2050. Based on the government's econometric
data, we created this large city model, and visualized many
possible futures on it. As I was excitably taking a group
of government officials and members of energy companies through one sustainable
future on our model, one of the participants told me, ""I cannot imagine that in the future
people will stop driving cars and start using public transport."" And then he said, ""There's no way I can tell my own son
to stop driving his car."" 07:19But we were prepared for this reaction. Working with scientists in a chemistry lab
in my home city in India, we had created approximate samples of what the air would be like in 2030
if our behavior stays the same. And so, I walked the group
over to this object that emits vapor from those air samples. Just one whiff of the noxious
polluted air from 2030 brought home the point
that no amount of data can. This is not the future you would want
your children to inherit. The next day, the government
made a big announcement. They would be investing billions
of dollars in renewables. We don't know what part our future
experiences played in this decision, but we know that they've changed
their energy policy to mitigate such a scenario. 08:06footnotefootnoteWhile something like air from the future
is very effective and tangible, the trajectory from our present
to a future consequence is not always so linear. Even when a technology
is developed with utopian ideals, the moment it leaves the laboratory
and enters the world, it is subject to forces outside
of the creators' control. For one particular project,
we investigated medical genomics: the technology of gathering
and using people's genetic data to create personalized medicine. We were asking: What are some of the unintended
consequences of linking our genetics to health care? To explore this question further, we created a fictional lawsuit, and brought it to life through 31 pieces
of carefully crafted evidence. So we built an illegal genetic clinic, a DIY carbon dioxide incubator, and even bought frozen mice on eBay. 09:02So now let's go to that future
where this lawsuit is unfolding, and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann. Arnold is being prosecuted
by this global giant biotech company called Dynamic Genetics, because they have evidence that Arnold has illegally inserted
the company's patented genetic material into his body. How on earth did Arnold manage to do that? Well, it all started when Arnold was asked to submit
a saliva sample in this spit kit to the NHI -- the UK's National Health
Insurance service. When Arnold received
his health insurance bill, he was shocked and scared to see that his premiums
had gone through the roof, beyond anything he or his family
could ever afford. 09:45The state's algorithm had scanned
his genetic data and found the risk of a chronic health
condition lurking in his DNA. And so Arnold had to start paying
toward the potential costs of that future disease -- potential future disease from today. In that moment of fear and panic, Arnold slipped through the city into the dark shadows
of this illegal clinic for treatment -- a treatment that would modify his DNA so that the state's algorithm
would no longer see him as a risk, and his insurance premiums
would become affordable again. But Arnold was caught. And the legal proceedings in the case
Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began. 10:22footnotefootnoteIn bringing such a future to life, what was important to us
was that people could actually touch, see and feel its potential, because such an immediate and close
encounter provokes people to ask the right questions, questions like: What are the implications
of living in a world where I'm judged on my genetics? Or: Who might claim ownership
to my genetic data, and what might they do with it? If this feels even slightly
out-there or farfetched, today there's a little-known bill
being passed through the American congress known as HR 1313, Preserving
Employee Wellness Programs Act. This bill proposes to amend the Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act, popularly known as GINA, and would allow employers to ask
about family medical history and genetic data to all employees for the first time. Those who refuse
would face large penalties. 11:17In the work I've shown so far, whether it was drones or genetic crimes, these stories describe troubling futures with the intention of helping us
avoid those futures. But what about what we can't avoid? Today, especially with climate change, it looks like we are heading for trouble. And so what we want to do now
is to prepare for that future by developing tools and attitudes
that can help us find hope -- hope that can inspire action. 11:44footnotefootnoteCurrently, we are running
an experiment in our studio. It's a work in progress. Based on climate data projections, we are exploring a future where the Western world has moved
from abundance to scarcity. We imagine living in a future city
with repeated flooding, periods with almost
no food in supermarkets, economic instabilities, broken supply chains. What can we do to not just survive,
but prosper in such a world? What food can we eat? 12:14To really step inside these questions, we are building this room in a flat
in London from 2050. It's like a little time capsule
that we reclaimed from the future. We stripped it down to the bare minimum. Everything we lovingly put in our homes, like flat-panel TVs, internet-connected fridges and artisanal furnishings all had to go. And in its place,
we're building food computers from abandoned, salvaged
and repurposed materials, turning today's waste
into tomorrow's dinner. For instance, we've just finished building our first
fully automated fogponics machine. It uses the technique of fogponics --
so just fog as a nutrient, not even water or soil -- to grow things quickly. At the moment, we have successfully grown tomatoes. But we'll need more food than what
we can grow in this small room. So what else could we forage
from the city? Insects? Pigeons? Foxes? 13:13Earlier, we brought back
air from the future. This time we are bringing
an entire room from the future, a room full of hope, tools and tactics to create positive action
in hostile conditions. Spending time in this room, a room that could be our own future home, makes the consequences
of climate change and food insecurity much more immediate and tangible. 13:37What we're learning through such
experiments and our practice and the people we engage with is that creating concrete experiences can bridge the disconnect
between today and tomorrow. By putting ourselves
into different possible futures, by becoming open and willing to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort
that such an act can bring, we have the opportunity
to imagine new possibilities. We can find optimistic futures; we can find paths forward; we can move beyond hope into action. It means we have the chance
to change direction, a chance to have our voices heard, a chance to write ourselves
into a future we want. Other worlds are possible. 14:22Thank you. 14:23(Applause)"

thought that getting a computer to tell the difference
between a cat and a dog would be almost impossible, even with the significant advance
in the state of artificial intelligence. Now we can do it at a level
greater than 99 percent accuracy. This is called image classification -- give it an image,
put a label to that image -- and computers know
thousands of other categories as well. 00:26I'm a graduate student
at the University of Washington, and I work on a project called Darknet, which is a neural network framework for training and testing
computer vision models. So let's just see what Darknet thinks of this image that we have. When we run our classifier on this image, we see we don't just get
a prediction of dog or cat, we actually get
specific breed predictions. That's the level
of granularity we have now. And it's correct. My dog is in fact a malamute. 00:57So we've made amazing strides
in image classification, but what happens
when we run our classifier on an image that looks like this? Well ... We see that the classifier comes back
with a pretty similar prediction. And it's correct,
there is a malamute in the image, but just given this label,
we don't actually know that much about what's going on in the image. We need something more powerful. I work on a problem
called object detection, where we look at an image
and try to find all of the objects, put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are. So here's what happens
when we run a detector on this image. 01:41Now, with this kind of result, we can do a lot more
with our computer vision algorithms. We see that it knows
that there's a cat and a dog. It knows their relative locations, their size. It may even know some extra information. There's a book sitting in the background. And if you want to build a system
on top of computer vision, say a self-driving vehicle
or a robotic system, this is the kind
of information that you want. You want something so that
you can interact with the physical world. Now, when I started working
on object detection, it took 20 seconds
to process a single image. And to get a feel for why
speed is so important in this domain, here's an example of an object detector that takes two seconds
to process an image. So this is 10 times faster than the 20-seconds-per-image detector, and you can see that by the time
it makes predictions, the entire state of the world has changed, and this wouldn't be very useful for an application. 02:41If we speed this up
by another factor of 10, this is a detector running
at five frames per second. This is a lot better, but for example, if there's any significant movement, I wouldn't want a system
like this driving my car. 02:57This is our detection system
running in real time on my laptop. So it smoothly tracks me
as I move around the frame, and it's robust to a wide variety
of changes in size, pose, forward, backward. This is great. This is what we really need if we're going to build systems
on top of computer vision. 03:19(Applause) 03:24So in just a few years, we've gone from 20 seconds per image to 20 milliseconds per image,
a thousand times faster. How did we get there? Well, in the past,
object detection systems would take an image like this and split it into a bunch of regions and then run a classifier
on each of these regions, and high scores for that classifier would be considered
detections in the image. But this involved running a classifier
thousands of times over an image, thousands of neural network evaluations
to produce detection. Instead, we trained a single network
to do all of detection for us. It produces all of the bounding boxes
and class probabilities simultaneously. With our system, instead of looking
at an image thousands of times to produce detection, you only look once, and that's why we call it
the YOLO method of object detection. So with this speed,
we're not just limited to images; we can process video in real time. And now, instead of just seeing
that cat and dog, we can see them move around
and interact with each other. 04:34This is a detector that we trained on 80 different classes in Microsoft's COCO dataset. It has all sorts of things
like spoon and fork, bowl, common objects like that. It has a variety of more exotic things: animals, cars, zebras, giraffes. And now we're going to do something fun. We're just going to go
out into the audience and see what kind of things we can detect. Does anyone want a stuffed animal? There are some teddy bears out there. And we can turn down
our threshold for detection a little bit, so we can find more of you guys
out in the audience. Let's see if we can get these stop signs. We find some backpacks. Let's just zoom in a little bit. And this is great. And all of the processing
is happening in real time on the laptop. 05:37And it's important to remember that this is a general purpose
object detection system, so we can train this for any image domain. The same code that we use to find stop signs or pedestrians, bicycles in a self-driving vehicle, can be used to find cancer cells in a tissue biopsy. And there are researchers around the globe
already using this technology for advances in things
like medicine, robotics. This morning, I read a paper where they were taking a census
of animals in Nairobi National Park with YOLO as part
of this detection system. And that's because Darknet is open source and in the public domain,
free for anyone to use. 06:25(Applause) 06:31But we wanted to make detection
even more accessible and usable, so through a combination
of model optimization, network binarization and approximation, we actually have object detection
running on a phone. 06:52(Applause) 06:58And I'm really excited because
now we have a pretty powerful solution to this low-level computer vision problem, and anyone can take it
and build something with it. So now the rest is up to all of you and people around the world
with access to this software, and I can't wait to see what people
will build with this technology. 07:20Thank you. 07:21(Applause)"
2,How we're teaching computers to understand pictures,Fei-Fei Li,Mar 2015,"When a very young child looks at a picture, she can identify simple elements: ""cat,"" ""book,"" ""chair."" Now, computers are getting smart enough to do that too. What's next? In a thrilling talk, computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li describes the state of the art  -- including the database of 15 million photos her team built to ""teach"" a computer to understand pictures -- and the key insights yet to come.", (89K),"Transcript (28 Languages)DanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:02Let me show you something. 00:06(Video) Girl: Okay, that's a cat
sitting in a bed. The boy is petting the elephant. Those are people
that are going on an airplane. That's a big airplane. 00:21Fei-Fei Li: This is
a three-year-old child describing what she sees
in a series of photos. She might still have a lot
to learn about this world, but she's already an expert
at one very important task: to make sense of what she sees. Our society is more
technologically advanced than ever. We send people to the moon,
we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations
that can play only music we like. Yet, our most advanced
machines and computers still struggle at this task. So I'm here today
to give you a progress report on the latest advances
in our research in computer vision, one of the most frontier
and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. 01:12Yes, we have prototyped cars
that can drive by themselves, but without smart vision,
they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag
on the road, which can be run over, and a rock that size,
which should be avoided. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras, but we have not delivered
sight to the blind. Drones can fly over massive land, but don't have enough vision technology to help us to track
the changes of the rainforests. Security cameras are everywhere, but they do not alert us when a child
is drowning in a swimming pool. Photos and videos are becoming
an integral part of global life. They're being generated at a pace
that's far beyond what any human, or teams of humans, could hope to view, and you and I are contributing
to that at this TED. Yet our most advanced software
is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous content. So in other words,
collectively as a society, we're very much blind, because our smartest 
machines are still blind. 02:31""Why is this so hard?"" you may ask. Cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into
a two-dimensional array of numbers known as pixels, but these are just lifeless numbers. They do not carry meaning in themselves. Just like to hear is not
the same as to listen, to take pictures is not
the same as to see, and by seeing,
we really mean understanding. In fact, it took Mother Nature
540 million years of hard work to do this task, and much of that effort went into developing the visual
processing apparatus of our brains, not the eyes themselves. So vision begins with the eyes, but it truly takes place in the brain. 03:26So for 15 years now, starting
from my Ph.D. at Caltech and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab, I've been working with my mentors,
collaborators and students to teach computers to see. Our research field is called
computer vision and machine learning. It's part of the general field
of artificial intelligence. So ultimately, we want to teach
the machines to see just like we do: naming objects, identifying people,
inferring 3D geometry of things, understanding relations, emotions,
actions and intentions. You and I weave together entire stories
of people, places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them. 04:16The first step towards this goal
is to teach a computer to see objects, the building block of the visual world. In its simplest terms,
imagine this teaching process as showing the computers
some training images of a particular object, let's say cats, and designing a model that learns
from these training images. How hard can this be? After all, a cat is just
a collection of shapes and colors, and this is what we did
in the early days of object modeling. We'd tell the computer algorithm
in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face,
a chubby body, two pointy ears, and a long tail, and that looked all fine. But what about this cat? (Laughter) It's all curled up. Now you have to add another shape
and viewpoint to the object model. But what if cats are hidden? What about these silly cats? Now you get my point. Even something as simple
as a household pet can present an infinite number
of variations to the object model, and that's just one object. 05:32So about eight years ago, a very simple and profound observation
changed my thinking. No one tells a child how to see, especially in the early years. They learn this through
real-world experiences and examples. If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras, they take one picture
about every 200 milliseconds, the average time an eye movement is made. So by age three, a child would have seen
hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world. That's a lot of training examples. So instead of focusing solely
on better and better algorithms, my insight was to give the algorithms
the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality. 06:32Once we know this, we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images
than we have ever had before, perhaps thousands of times more, and together with Professor
Kai Li at Princeton University, we launched the ImageNet project in 2007. Luckily, we didn't have to mount
a camera on our head and wait for many years. We went to the Internet, the biggest treasure trove of pictures
that humans have ever created. We downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology
like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to help us to label these images. At its peak, ImageNet was one of
the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers: together, almost 50,000 workers from 167 countries around the world helped us to clean, sort and label nearly a billion candidate images. That was how much effort it took to capture even a fraction
of the imagery a child's mind takes in
in the early developmental years. 07:52In hindsight, this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms
may seem obvious now, but back in 2007, it was not so obvious. We were fairly alone on this journey
for quite a while. Some very friendly colleagues advised me
to do something more useful for my tenure, and we were constantly struggling
for research funding. Once, I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen
my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet. After all, that's how I funded
my college years. 08:29So we carried on. In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered a database of 15 million images across 22,000 classes
of objects and things organized by everyday English words. In both quantity and quality, this was an unprecedented scale. As an example, in the case of cats, we have more than 62,000 cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species
of domestic and wild cats. We were thrilled
to have put together ImageNet, and we wanted the whole research world
to benefit from it, so in the TED fashion,
we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide
research community for free. (Applause) 09:29Now that we have the data
to nourish our computer brain, we're ready to come back
to the algorithms themselves. As it turned out, the wealth
of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a particular class
of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network, pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima,
Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun back in the 1970s and '80s. Just like the brain consists
of billions of highly connected neurons, a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron-like node. It takes input from other nodes and sends output to others. Moreover, these hundreds of thousands
or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers, also similar to the brain. In a typical neural network we use
to train our object recognition model, it has 24 million nodes, 140 million parameters, and 15 billion connections. That's an enormous model. Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs
to train such a humongous model, the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected. It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results
in object recognition. This is a computer telling us this picture contains a cat and where the cat is. Of course there are more things than cats, so here's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains
a boy and a teddy bear; a dog, a person, and a small kite
in the background; or a picture of very busy things like a man, a skateboard,
railings, a lampost, and so on. Sometimes, when the computer
is not so confident about what it sees, we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer
instead of committing too much, just like we would do, but other times our computer algorithm
is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are, like the make, model, year of the cars. 11:58We applied this algorithm to millions
of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities, and we have learned something
really interesting: first, it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes. But surprisingly, car prices
also correlate well with crime rates in cities, or voting patterns by zip codes. 12:32So wait a minute. Is that it? Has the computer already matched
or even surpassed human capabilities? Not so fast. So far, we have just taught
the computer to see objects. This is like a small child
learning to utter a few nouns. It's an incredible accomplishment, but it's only the first step. Soon, another developmental
milestone will be hit, and children begin
to communicate in sentences. So instead of saying
this is a cat in the picture, you already heard the little girl
telling us this is a cat lying on a bed. 13:12So to teach a computer
to see a picture and generate sentences, the marriage between big data
and machine learning algorithm has to take another step. Now, the computer has to learn
from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. Just like the brain integrates
vision and language, we developed a model
that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences. 13:50About four months ago, we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first
computer vision models that is capable of generating
a human-like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time. Now, I'm ready to show you
what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw
at the beginning of this talk. 14:19(Video) Computer: A man is standing
next to an elephant. A large airplane sitting on top
of an airport runway. 14:29FFL: Of course, we're still working hard
to improve our algorithms, and it still has a lot to learn. (Applause) 14:39And the computer still makes mistakes. 14:42(Video) Computer: A cat lying
on a bed in a blanket. 14:46FFL: So of course, when it sees
too many cats, it thinks everything
might look like a cat. 14:53(Video) Computer: A young boy
is holding a baseball bat. (Laughter) 14:57FFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush,
it confuses it with a baseball bat. 15:03(Video) Computer: A man riding a horse
down a street next to a building. (Laughter) 15:08FFL: We haven't taught Art 101
to the computers. 15:13(Video) Computer: A zebra standing
in a field of grass. 15:16FFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate
the stunning beauty of nature like you and I do. 15:22So it has been a long journey. To get from age zero to three was hard. The real challenge is to go
from three to 13 and far beyond. Let me remind you with this picture
of the boy and the cake again. So far, we have taught
the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story
when seeing a picture. 15:47(Video) Computer: A person sitting
at a table with a cake. 15:51FFL: But there's so much more 
to this picture than just a person and a cake. What the computer doesn't see
is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time. The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt given to him as a gift by his father
after a trip to Sydney, and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind
at that moment. 16:19This is my son Leo. On my quest for visual intelligence, I think of Leo constantly and the future world he will live in. When machines can see, doctors and nurses will have
extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose
and take care of patients. Cars will run smarter
and safer on the road. Robots, not just humans, will help us to brave the disaster zones
to save the trapped and wounded. We will discover new species, 
better materials, and explore unseen frontiers
with the help of the machines. 17:03Little by little, we're giving sight
to the machines. First, we teach them to see. Then, they help us to see better. For the first time, human eyes
won't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world. We will not only use the machines
for their intelligence, we will also collaborate with them
in ways that we cannot even imagine. 17:29This is my quest: to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future
for Leo and for the world. 17:39Thank you. 17:41(Applause)"

What will the next generation of these digital helpers look and sound like? Customer experience professional Karen Lellouche Tordjman gives us a glimpse of where they're headed -- and breaks down the two key challenges engineers need to crack in order to usher in a new age of truly smart voice assistants.", (55K),"Transcript (16 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPolskiPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:00It's Monday morning. You've just received a voice notification
from your voice assistant. 00:07Voice assistant: Good morning. There's a new pair of pants
on sale at your favorite store. Last week, while wearing
your smart glasses, you were drawn to a similar
pair on a colleague. Would you like to wear them
to the party on Thursday? I suggest you skip the movies
tomorrow night to afford them. Say ""yes"" to validate the purchase. Let me know if I should also
find a gift for your host. I can make suggestions
based on your budget and her public Instagram profile. Say ""yes"" to proceed. 00:36Karen Lellouche Tordjman: Yes. 00:38So, thrilling or scary? Because this is how our future
could look very soon. As a working mom, I find it exciting. I would love to stop
doing Google searches, wasting time doing Amazon scrolling,
budget calculation or optimizing my calendar. What is thrilling is the prospect
of having a companion that would cater specifically
to my needs and requests. Just imagine, it could do things,
like using my heart rate to tweak my Starbucks order
to reduce caffeine. It could take into account my lunch
and the number of steps I've walked to tailor a workout for me. It could even align
with my friend's smart assistant to craft evening plans that would fit everyone's budget,
calendars and locations. 01:38Obviously, this scenario could easily
lean towards the scary. This is why there needs to be
regulation in place. All users, all consumers, should always
remain in full control of data they share and on which type of recommendations
they agree to get or not to get. 01:59Now, recommendation engines powered
by artificial intelligence are not new. Far from it. We actually use them
multiple times a day already. On average, 70 percent
of the time spent on YouTube is on videos recommended
by their algorithm. And you may also own a wristband
that you use to track your sleep or monitor your workout. And there's the first generation
of voice-enabled virtual assistants. You know, like Google Home or Amazon Alexa that you can use to change
the temperature of your room. Your car as well is probably equipped
with the same things that can help you manage your music or give you directions, hands-free. 02:52But there is one thing
that all these tools have in common. They leverage AI to help you
in one specific area of your life. Your home, your car, your health. They stay in the lane. Now imagine a new generation
of voice assistants that crosses all lanes, that synchronizes everything. 03:20So you may ask,
why hasn't this happened already? Because there are two technological bricks
that are critical to make this happen that are still missing. One is voice. These tools must be able
to understand everything we say. And clearly, this is not the case today. For my kids, maybe yours as well, Siri is still an endless source of fun. They like asking very simple questions and still get very confused answers. Two, breadth. They must be able to provide
a large range of recommendations to cover whatever we may need. 04:06So tech players are still working
on cracking those two elements, voice and breadth. On voice, as I said, Alexa,
Google Home, Siri and the likes, they don't understand us entirely
and systematically for now. Actually, understanding
human language is difficult. It's as much about the context as it is about the words themselves. And think about the accents
or background noise. It's already very difficult for Americans to understand French people
speaking English, 04:44(Laughter) 04:45so can you imagine how difficult
it can be for a robot? 04:49So tech players are working hard on this. In 2018, Google launched
an investment program for start-ups that would work
with their Google Home suites. And since then, they have invested
in over 15 companies. Amazon has 10,000 employees working on Alexa voice technologies. So they will eventually crack
the voice issues. The smart assistants will be able
to understand what we say, the meaning of the words in their context. For example, if I’m using my smart
assistant, and I’m listening to music, and then I say, ""Change."" 05:36VA: Hi, Karen. Do you want to change
the temperature of the room? 05:40KLT: Well, clearly
this is not working yet, but in the future, it will understand that I'm talking
about changing the track, not changing the temperature of the room. It will also understand
our long and complex requests. You know, when we start saying something and then we change our mind mid-sentence. But that doesn't stop here. With far-field speech recognition, you will be able to use it
from a distance, from a room to another. Even with background noise
like kids screaming or traffic. 06:15(Kids shout, whistle blows) 06:22Tremendous progress
has been made on this recently, largely due to Amazon's efforts
on their Echo speaker technology. Not only that. It will be able to understand
in which mood you’re in -- joy, sadness, annoyance -- and will be able to mimic
these feelings too. And as natural language processing
advances further -- so natural language processing
is the technology behind this -- so as it advances further, the voice-enabled interactions
will increasingly be refined. 07:03Now, the second challenge
and the biggest, in my opinion, revolves around the breadth
of recommendations provided. Will they be able to -- What will be their range of actions? Will they remain limited
to very specific tasks, or will they be able to become
a true companion across your day to which you can ask whatever you want, whatever you need? For example, taking notes in a meeting or reordering milk or even mental health coaching. Will they be able
to provide you recommendations across product categories? Today, companies provide us recommendations
within one specific category, for example, that can help us choose
between two dresses, between two books. In the future, the smart assistants
will actually be able to help us choose between buying a book or buying a dress. 08:06So to be able to deliver this integrated
and large range of recommendations, tech teams behind smart assistants
will need to design the right algorithms. And these algorithms will need
to be powerful enough to process a myriad of data points. To identify patterns, to model courses of actions, and also to learn
from end users' feedback. But, a world where smart assistants
become unavoidable means new priorities for all companies, not only the smart assistant players. Every business in the future
will need to accelerate drastically on data and algorithm, on voice-enabled interactions. And also, they will need to be
entrusted by consumers to provide recommendations. This is what I like to
summarize in three words, in the three imperatives
that are data, tech and trust. So the moment the breadth challenge and the voice challenge get solved will be a tipping point in smart assistant usage
and adoption by consumers. 09:30Today, can you live
without your smartphone? I assume not, right? In a few years from now, your smart assistant will be a convenient, powerful, reliable helper essential in your day-to-day life. So you won't be able to live without it. And unlike your smartphones, it will be embedded
in every device around you. Your smartphone itself, of course, but also your car, the mirrors, your fridge, your glasses and who knows what other
device in the future. 10:10So are you ready for a smarter life? 10:14VA: Yes, Karen, I am. 10:16(Laughter) 10:17Thank you. 10:18(Applause)"
2,Don't fear superintelligent AI,Grady Booch,Feb 2017,"New tech spawns new anxieties, says scientist and philosopher Grady Booch, but we don't need to be afraid an all-powerful, unfeeling AI.

I was the quintessential nerd. I think some of you were, too. 00:07(Laughter) 00:08And you, sir, who laughed the loudest,
you probably still are. 00:12(Laughter) 00:14I grew up in a small town
in the dusty plains of north Texas, the son of a sheriff
who was the son of a pastor. Getting into trouble was not an option. And so I started reading
calculus books for fun. 00:27(Laughter) 00:28You did, too. That led me to building a laser
and a computer and model rockets, and that led me to making
rocket fuel in my bedroom. Now, in scientific terms, we call this a very bad idea. 00:44(Laughter) 00:46Around that same time, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey""
came to the theaters, and my life was forever changed. I loved everything about that movie, especially the HAL 9000. Now, HAL was a sentient computer designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft from the Earth to Jupiter. HAL was also a flawed character, for in the end he chose
to value the mission over human life. Now, HAL was a fictional character, but nonetheless he speaks to our fears, our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity. 01:25I believe that such fears are unfounded. Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time in human history, where, driven by refusal to accept
the limits of our bodies and our minds, we are building machines of exquisite, beautiful
complexity and grace that will extend the human experience in ways beyond our imagining. 01:47After a career that led me
from the Air Force Academy to Space Command to now, I became a systems engineer, and recently I was drawn
into an engineering problem associated with NASA's mission to Mars. Now, in space flights to the Moon, we can rely upon
mission control in Houston to watch over all aspects of a flight. However, Mars is 200 times further away, and as a result it takes
on average 13 minutes for a signal to travel
from the Earth to Mars. If there's trouble,
there's not enough time. And so a reasonable engineering solution calls for us to put mission control inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft. Another fascinating idea
in the mission profile places humanoid robots
on the surface of Mars before the humans themselves arrive, first to build facilities and later to serve as collaborative
members of the science team. 02:43Now, as I looked at this
from an engineering perspective, it became very clear to me
that what I needed to architect was a smart, collaborative, socially intelligent
artificial intelligence. In other words, I needed to build
something very much like a HAL but without the homicidal tendencies. 03:00(Laughter) 03:02Let's pause for a moment. Is it really possible to build
an artificial intelligence like that? Actually, it is. In many ways, this is a hard engineering problem with elements of AI, not some wet hair ball of an AI problem
that needs to be engineered. To paraphrase Alan Turing, I'm not interested
in building a sentient machine. I'm not building a HAL. All I'm after is a simple brain, something that offers
the illusion of intelligence. 03:33The art and the science of computing
have come a long way since HAL was onscreen, and I'd imagine if his inventor
Dr. Chandra were here today, he'd have a whole lot of questions for us. Is it really possible for us to take a system of millions
upon millions of devices, to read in their data streams, to predict their failures
and act in advance? Yes. Can we build systems that converse
with humans in natural language? Yes. Can we build systems
that recognize objects, identify emotions, emote themselves,
play games and even read lips? Yes. Can we build a system that sets goals, that carries out plans against those goals
and learns along the way? Yes. Can we build systems
that have a theory of mind? This we are learning to do. Can we build systems that have
an ethical and moral foundation? This we must learn how to do. So let's accept for a moment that it's possible to build
such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others. 04:31The next question
you must ask yourself is, should we fear it? Now, every new technology brings with it
some measure of trepidation. When we first saw cars, people lamented that we would see
the destruction of the family. When we first saw telephones come in, people were worried it would destroy
all civil conversation. At a point in time we saw
the written word become pervasive, people thought we would lose
our ability to memorize. These things are all true to a degree, but it's also the case
that these technologies brought to us things
that extended the human experience in some profound ways. 05:09So let's take this a little further. I do not fear the creation
of an AI like this, because it will eventually
embody some of our values. Consider this: building a cognitive system
is fundamentally different than building a traditional
software-intensive system of the past. We don't program them. We teach them. In order to teach a system
how to recognize flowers, I show it thousands of flowers
of the kinds I like. In order to teach a system
how to play a game -- Well, I would. You would, too. I like flowers. Come on. To teach a system
how to play a game like Go, I'd have it play thousands of games of Go, but in the process I also teach it how to discern
a good game from a bad game. If I want to create an artificially
intelligent legal assistant, I will teach it some corpus of law but at the same time I am fusing with it the sense of mercy and justice
that is part of that law. In scientific terms,
this is what we call ground truth, and here's the important point: in producing these machines, we are therefore teaching them
a sense of our values. To that end, I trust
an artificial intelligence the same, if not more,
as a human who is well-trained. 06:24But, you may ask, what about rogue agents, some well-funded
nongovernment organization? I do not fear an artificial intelligence
in the hand of a lone wolf. Clearly, we cannot protect ourselves
against all random acts of violence, but the reality is such a system requires substantial training
and subtle training far beyond the resources of an individual. And furthermore, it's far more than just injecting
an internet virus to the world, where you push a button,
all of a sudden it's in a million places and laptops start blowing up
all over the place. Now, these kinds of substances
are much larger, and we'll certainly see them coming. 07:02Do I fear that such
an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity? If you look at movies
such as ""The Matrix,"" ""Metropolis,"" ""The Terminator,""
shows such as ""Westworld,"" they all speak of this kind of fear. Indeed, in the book ""Superintelligence""
by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, he picks up on this theme and observes that a superintelligence
might not only be dangerous, it could represent an existential threat
to all of humanity. Dr. Bostrom's basic argument is that such systems will eventually have such an insatiable
thirst for information that they will perhaps learn how to learn and eventually discover
that they may have goals that are contrary to human needs. Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers. He is supported by people
such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. With all due respect to these brilliant minds, I believe that they
are fundamentally wrong. Now, there are a lot of pieces
of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack, and I don't have time to unpack them all, but very briefly, consider this: super knowing is very different
than super doing. HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew only insofar as HAL commanded
all aspects of the Discovery. So it would have to be
with a superintelligence. It would have to have dominion
over all of our world. This is the stuff of Skynet
from the movie ""The Terminator"" in which we had a superintelligence that commanded human will, that directed every device
that was in every corner of the world. Practically speaking, it ain't gonna happen. We are not building AIs
that control the weather, that direct the tides, that command us
capricious, chaotic humans. And furthermore, if such
an artificial intelligence existed, it would have to compete
with human economies, and thereby compete for resources with us. And in the end -- don't tell Siri this -- we can always unplug them. 09:01(Laughter) 09:05We are on an incredible journey of coevolution with our machines. The humans we are today are not the humans we will be then. To worry now about the rise
of a superintelligence is in many ways a dangerous distraction because the rise of computing itself brings to us a number
of human and societal issues to which we must now attend. How shall I best organize society when the need for human labor diminishes? How can I bring understanding
and education throughout the globe and still respect our differences? How might I extend and enhance human life
through cognitive healthcare? How might I use computing to help take us to the stars? 09:49And that's the exciting thing. The opportunities to use computing to advance the human experience are within our reach, here and now, and we are just beginning. 10:02Thank you very much. 10:03(Applause)"
2,The 4 greatest threats to the survival of humanity,TED-Ed,Jul 2022,"With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy itself for the first time in our history.

a nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way
to the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted
the initial warning. What they thought was the first missile
in a massive attack was actually a research rocket
studying the Northern Lights. This incident happened 
after the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest
calls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. 00:45With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy
itself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse 
of human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power
to reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which 
of our activities pose existential threats now, 
and which might in the future. 01:16So far, our species has survived
2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk
from natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,
and the like. Assessing existential risk is 
an inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out
how likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity
has never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to
determine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about 
1 in 10,000 per century. 01:52Nuclear weapons were our first
addition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated
with nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes
from the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads
to a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities
blocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity
depends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell
if they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war
would cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat
to humanity. 02:33The next major addition to our existential
risk was climate change. Like nuclear war, 
climate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios 
that we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing
extinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees
Celsius of warming, but can’t yet completely 
rule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly
unprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose
a direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause
would likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. 03:15The greatest risks may come 
from technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history
have been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling
us to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly
than naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics 
through biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing
and modification, along with increased availability
of potentially dangerous information like the published genomes 
of deadly viruses, also increase the number of people
and groups who could potentially create
such pathogens. 03:55Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be
the century where we develop artificial intelligence
that surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place
our future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s 
best interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose 
an existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned 
with human values— a task scientists are finding
extremely difficult. 04:27Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic
existential risk is more than 100 times higher 
than the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily
on human choices. Because most of the risk is from human
action, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future
as the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands."
2,Robots that fly ... and cooperate,Vijay Kumar,Mar 2012,"In his lab at Penn, Vijay Kumar and his team build flying quadrotors, small, agile robots that swarm, sense each other, and form ad hoc teams -- for construction, surveying disasters and far more.", (162K),"Transcript (34 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάМонголРусскийУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیमराठीहिन्दीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:05Good morning. I'm here today to talk
about autonomous flying beach balls. 00:11(Laughter) 00:12No, agile aerial robots like this one. I'd like to tell you a little bit
about the challenges in building these, and some of the terrific opportunities
for applying this technology. So these robots are related
to unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the vehicles
you see here are big. They weigh thousands of pounds,
are not by any means agile. They're not even autonomous. In fact, many of these vehicles
are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots, operators of sensors, and mission coordinators. 00:48What we're interested in
is developing robots like this -- and here are two other pictures -- of robots that you can buy off the shelf. So these are helicopters with four rotors, and they're roughly
a meter or so in scale, and weigh several pounds. And so we retrofit these
with sensors and processors, and these robots can fly indoors. Without GPS. 01:12The robot I'm holding in my hand is this one, and it's been created by two students, Alex and Daniel. So this weighs a little more
than a tenth of a pound. It consumes about 15 watts of power. And as you can see,
it's about eight inches in diameter. So let me give you
just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work. 01:35So it has four rotors. If you spin these rotors
at the same speed, the robot hovers. If you increase the speed
of each of these rotors, then the robot flies up,
it accelerates up. Of course, if the robot were tilted, inclined to the horizontal, then it would accelerate
in this direction. So to get it to tilt, there's one of two ways of doing it. So in this picture, you see
that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower. And when that happens, there's a moment that causes
this robot to roll. And the other way around, if you increase the speed of rotor three
and decrease the speed of rotor one, then the robot pitches forward. 02:18And then finally, if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair, then the robot yaws
about the vertical axis. So an on-board processor essentially looks at what motions
need to be executed and combines these motions, and figures out what commands
to send to the motors -- 600 times a second. That's basically how this thing operates. 02:40So one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down, the robot naturally becomes agile. So here, R is the characteristic
length of the robot. It's actually half the diameter. And there are lots of physical parameters
that change as you reduce R. The one that's most important
is the inertia, or the resistance to motion. So it turns out the inertia,
which governs angular motion, scales as a fifth power of R. So the smaller you make R, the more dramatically the inertia reduces. So as a result, the angular acceleration, denoted by the Greek letter alpha here, goes as 1 over R. It's inversely proportional to R. The smaller you make it,
the more quickly you can turn. 03:28So this should be clear in these videos. On the bottom right, you see a robot
performing a 360-degree flip in less than half a second. Multiple flips, a little more time. So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers
and gyros on board, and calculating, like I said before, commands at 600 times a second, to stabilize this robot. So on the left, you see Daniel
throwing this robot up into the air, and it shows you
how robust the control is. No matter how you throw it, the robot recovers and comes back to him. 04:03So why build robots like this? Well, robots like this
have many applications. You can send them
inside buildings like this, as first responders to look for intruders, maybe look for biochemical leaks, gaseous leaks. You can also use them
for applications like construction. So here are robots carrying beams, columns and assembling cube-like structures. I'll tell you a little bit
more about this. The robots can be used
for transporting cargo. So one of the problems
with these small robots is their payload-carrying capacity. So you might want to have
multiple robots carry payloads. This is a picture of a recent
experiment we did -- actually not so recent anymore -- in Sendai, shortly after the earthquake. So robots like this could be sent
into collapsed buildings, to assess the damage
after natural disasters, or sent into reactor buildings, to map radiation levels. 05:04So one fundamental problem
that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous, is essentially figuring out how to get
from point A to point B. So this gets a little challenging, because the dynamics of this robot
are quite complicated. In fact, they live
in a 12-dimensional space. So we use a little trick. We take this curved 12-dimensional space, and transform it into a flat,
four-dimensional space. And that four-dimensional space
consists of X, Y, Z, and then the yaw angle. 05:34And so what the robot does, is it plans what we call
a minimum-snap trajectory. So to remind you of physics: You have position, derivative, velocity; then acceleration; and then comes jerk, and then comes snap. So this robot minimizes snap. So what that effectively does, is produce a smooth and graceful motion. And it does that avoiding obstacles. So these minimum-snap trajectories
in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated
12-dimensional space, which the robot must do
for control and then execution. 06:11So let me show you some examples of what these minimum-snap
trajectories look like. And in the first video, you'll see the robot going
from point A to point B, through an intermediate point. 06:21(Whirring noise) 06:28So the robot is obviously capable
of executing any curve trajectory. So these are circular trajectories, where the robot pulls about two G's. Here you have overhead
motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is
100 times a second. It also tells the robot
where these obstacles are. And the obstacles can be moving. And here, you'll see Daniel
throw this hoop into the air, while the robot is calculating
the position of the hoop, and trying to figure out how to best
go through the hoop. So as an academic, we're always trained to be able
to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs, and we get our robots to do that. 07:06(Applause) 07:13So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre-programmed. So here, you see the robot combining
a motion that builds up momentum, and then changes its orientation
and then recovers. So it has to do this
because this gap in the window is only slightly larger
than the width of the robot. So just like a diver
stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum, and then does this pirouette,
this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers, this robot is basically doing that. So it knows how to combine
little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks. 07:54So I want change gears. So one of the disadvantages
of these small robots is its size. And I told you earlier that we may want to employ
lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size. So one difficulty is: How do you coordinate
lots of these robots? And so here, we looked to nature. So I want to show you a clip
of Aphaenogaster desert ants, in Professor Stephen Pratt's lab,
carrying an object. So this is actually a piece of fig. Actually you take any object
coated with fig juice, and the ants will carry it
back to the nest. So these ants don't have
any central coordinator. They sense their neighbors. There's no explicit communication. But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object, they have implicit coordination
across the group. 08:42So this is the kind of coordination
we want our robots to have. So when we have a robot
which is surrounded by neighbors -- and let's look at robot I and robot J -- what we want the robots to do, is to monitor the separation between them, as they fly in formation. And then you want to make sure that this separation
is within acceptable levels. So again, the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands
100 times a second, which then translates into motor commands, 600 times a second. So this also has to be done
in a decentralized way. Again, if you have
lots and lots of robots, it's impossible to coordinate
all this information centrally fast enough in order for the robots
to accomplish the task. Plus, the robots have to base
their actions only on local information -- what they sense from their neighbors. And then finally, we insist that the robots be agnostic
to who their neighbors are. So this is what we call anonymity. 09:41So what I want to show you next
is a video of 20 of these little robots, flying in formation. They're monitoring
their neighbors' positions. They're maintaining formation. The formations can change. They can be planar formations, they can be three-dimensional formations. As you can see here, they collapse from a three-dimensional
formation into planar formation. And to fly through obstacles, they can adapt the formations on the fly. So again, these robots come
really close together. As you can see
in this figure-eight flight, they come within inches of each other. And despite the aerodynamic interactions
with these propeller blades, they're able to maintain stable flight. 10:26(Applause) 10:33So once you know how to fly in formation, you can actually pick up
objects cooperatively. So this just shows that we can
double, triple, quadruple the robots' strength, by just getting them to team
with neighbors, as you can see here. One of the disadvantages of doing that is,
as you scale things up -- so if you have lots of robots
carrying the same thing, you're essentially increasing the inertia, and therefore you pay a price;
they're not as agile. But you do gain in terms
of payload-carrying capacity. 11:02Another application I want to show you --
again, this is in our lab. This is work done by Quentin Lindsey,
who's a graduate student. So his algorithm essentially
tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements. So his algorithm tells the robot
what part to pick up, when, and where to place it. So in this video you see -- and it's sped up 10, 14 times -- you see three different structures
being built by these robots. And again, everything is autonomous, and all Quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint
of the design that he wants to build. 11:41So all these experiments
you've seen thus far, all these demonstrations, have been done with the help
of motion-capture systems. So what happens when you leave your lab, and you go outside into the real world? And what if there's no GPS? So this robot is actually
equipped with a camera, and a laser rangefinder, laser scanner. And it uses these sensors
to build a map of the environment. What that map consists of are features -- like doorways, windows,
people, furniture -- and it then figures out
where its position is, with respect to the features. So there is no global coordinate system. The coordinate system
is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at. And it navigates with respect
to those features. 12:31So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen
and Professor Nathan Michael, that shows this robot entering
a building for the very first time, and creating this map on the fly. So the robot then figures out
what the features are, it builds the map, it figures out where it is
with respect to the features, and then estimates its position
100 times a second, allowing us to use the control algorithms
that I described to you earlier. So this robot is actually being
commanded remotely by Frank, but the robot can also figure out
where to go on its own. So suppose I were to send
this into a building, and I had no idea
what this building looked like. I can ask this robot to go in, create a map, and then come back and tell me
what the building looks like. So here, the robot is not
only solving the problem of how to go from point A
to point B in this map, but it's figuring out what the best
point B is at every time. So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have
the least information, and that's how it populates this map. 13:35So I want to leave you
with one last application. And there are many applications
of this technology. I'm a professor, and we're
passionate about education. Robots like this can really change
the way we do K-12 education. But we're in Southern California, close to Los Angeles, so I have to conclude with something
focused on entertainment. I want to conclude with a music video. I want to introduce the creators,
Alex and Daniel, who created this video. 14:03(Applause) 14:10So before I play this video, I want to tell you that they created it
in the last three days, after getting a call from Chris. And the robots that play in the video
are completely autonomous. You will see nine robots
play six different instruments. And of course, it's made
exclusively for TED 2012. Let's watch. 14:31(Sound of air escaping from valve) 14:38(Music) 14:41(Whirring sound) 15:04(Music) 16:08(Applause) (Cheers)"
2,How computers are learning to be creative,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,Jun 2016,"We're on the edge of a new frontier in art and creativity -- and it's not human.

that works on machine intelligence; in other words, the engineering discipline
of making computers and devices able to do some of the things
that brains do. And this makes us
interested in real brains and neuroscience as well, and especially interested
in the things that our brains do that are still far superior
to the performance of computers. 00:25Historically, one of those areas
has been perception, the process by which things
out there in the world -- sounds and images -- can turn into concepts in the mind. This is essential for our own brains, and it's also pretty useful on a computer. The machine perception algorithms,
for example, that our team makes, are what enable your pictures
on Google Photos to become searchable, based on what's in them. The flip side of perception is creativity: turning a concept into something
out there into the world. So over the past year,
our work on machine perception has also unexpectedly connected
with the world of machine creativity and machine art. 01:08I think Michelangelo
had a penetrating insight into to this dual relationship
between perception and creativity. This is a famous quote of his: ""Every block of stone
has a statue inside of it, and the job of the sculptor
is to discover it."" So I think that what
Michelangelo was getting at is that we create by perceiving, and that perception itself
is an act of imagination and is the stuff of creativity. 01:38The organ that does all the thinking
and perceiving and imagining, of course, is the brain. And I'd like to begin
with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains. Because unlike, say,
the heart or the intestines, you really can't say very much
about a brain by just looking at it, at least with the naked eye. The early anatomists who looked at brains gave the superficial structures
of this thing all kinds of fanciful names, like hippocampus, meaning ""little shrimp."" But of course that sort of thing
doesn't tell us very much about what's actually going on inside. 02:12The first person who, I think, really
developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great Spanish neuroanatomist,
Santiago Ramón y Cajal, in the 19th century, who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in
or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain, in order to start to understand
their morphologies. And these are the kinds of drawings
that he made of neurons in the 19th century. 02:42This is from a bird brain. And you see this incredible variety
of different sorts of cells, even the cellular theory itself
was quite new at this point. And these structures, these cells that have these arborizations, these branches that can go
very, very long distances -- this was very novel at the time. They're reminiscent, of course, of wires. That might have been obvious
to some people in the 19th century; the revolutions of wiring and electricity
were just getting underway. But in many ways, these microanatomical drawings
of Ramón y Cajal's, like this one, they're still in some ways unsurpassed. 03:16We're still more than a century later, trying to finish the job
that Ramón y Cajal started. These are raw data from our collaborators at the Max Planck Institute
of Neuroscience. And what our collaborators have done is to image little pieces of brain tissue. The entire sample here
is about one cubic millimeter in size, and I'm showing you a very,
very small piece of it here. That bar on the left is about one micron. The structures you see are mitochondria that are the size of bacteria. And these are consecutive slices through this very, very
tiny block of tissue. Just for comparison's sake, the diameter of an average strand
of hair is about 100 microns. So we're looking at something
much, much smaller than a single strand of hair. 04:02And from these kinds of serial
electron microscopy slices, one can start to make reconstructions
in 3D of neurons that look like these. So these are sort of in the same
style as Ramón y Cajal. Only a few neurons lit up, because otherwise we wouldn't
be able to see anything here. It would be so crowded, so full of structure, of wiring all connecting
one neuron to another. 04:25So Ramón y Cajal was a little bit
ahead of his time, and progress on understanding the brain proceeded slowly
over the next few decades. But we knew that neurons used electricity, and by World War II, our technology
was advanced enough to start doing real electrical
experiments on live neurons to better understand how they worked. This was the very same time
when computers were being invented, very much based on the idea
of modeling the brain -- of ""intelligent machinery,""
as Alan Turing called it, one of the fathers of computer science. 04:57Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts
looked at Ramón y Cajal's drawing of visual cortex, which I'm showing here. This is the cortex that processes
imagery that comes from the eye. And for them, this looked
like a circuit diagram. So there are a lot of details
in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram that are not quite right. But this basic idea that visual cortex works like a series
of computational elements that pass information
one to the next in a cascade, is essentially correct. 05:29Let's talk for a moment about what a model for processing
visual information would need to do. The basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say, ""That's a bird,"" which is a very simple thing
for us to do with our brains. But you should all understand
that for a computer, this was pretty much impossible
just a few years ago. The classical computing paradigm is not one in which
this task is easy to do. 05:59So what's going on between the pixels, between the image of the bird
and the word ""bird,"" is essentially a set of neurons
connected to each other in a neural network, as I'm diagramming here. This neural network could be biological,
inside our visual cortices, or, nowadays, we start
to have the capability to model such neural networks
on the computer. And I'll show you what
that actually looks like. 06:22So the pixels you can think
about as a first layer of neurons, and that's, in fact,
how it works in the eye -- that's the neurons in the retina. And those feed forward into one layer after another layer,
after another layer of neurons, all connected by synapses
of different weights. The behavior of this network is characterized by the strengths
of all of those synapses. Those characterize the computational
properties of this network. And at the end of the day, you have a neuron
or a small group of neurons that light up, saying, ""bird."" 06:51Now I'm going to represent
those three things -- the input pixels and the synapses
in the neural network, and bird, the output -- by three variables: x, w and y. There are maybe a million or so x's -- a million pixels in that image. There are billions or trillions of w's, which represent the weights of all
these synapses in the neural network. And there's a very small number of y's, of outputs that that network has. ""Bird"" is only four letters, right? So let's pretend that this
is just a simple formula, x ""x"" w = y. I'm putting the times in scare quotes because what's really
going on there, of course, is a very complicated series
of mathematical operations. 07:35That's one equation. There are three variables. And we all know
that if you have one equation, you can solve one variable
by knowing the other two things. So the problem of inference, that is, figuring out
that the picture of a bird is a bird, is this one: it's where y is the unknown
and w and x are known. You know the neural network,
you know the pixels. As you can see, that's actually
a relatively straightforward problem. You multiply two times three
and you're done. I'll show you an artificial neural network that we've built recently,
doing exactly that. 08:09This is running in real time
on a mobile phone, and that's, of course,
amazing in its own right, that mobile phones can do so many
billions and trillions of operations per second. What you're looking at is a phone looking at one after another
picture of a bird, and actually not only saying,
""Yes, it's a bird,"" but identifying the species of bird
with a network of this sort. So in that picture, the x and the w are known,
and the y is the unknown. I'm glossing over the very
difficult part, of course, which is how on earth
do we figure out the w, the brain that can do such a thing? How would we ever learn such a model? 08:49So this process of learning,
of solving for w, if we were doing this
with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers, we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w, well, we divide by two and we're done. The problem is with this operator. So, division -- we've used division because
it's the inverse to multiplication, but as I've just said, the multiplication is a bit of a lie here. This is a very, very complicated,
very non-linear operation; it has no inverse. So we have to figure out a way
to solve the equation without a division operator. And the way to do that
is fairly straightforward. You just say, let's play
a little algebra trick, and move the six over
to the right-hand side of the equation. Now, we're still using multiplication. And that zero -- let's think
about it as an error. In other words, if we've solved
for w the right way, then the error will be zero. And if we haven't gotten it quite right, the error will be greater than zero. 09:47So now we can just take guesses
to minimize the error, and that's the sort of thing
computers are very good at. So you've taken an initial guess: what if w = 0? Well, then the error is 6. What if w = 1? The error is 4. And then the computer can
sort of play Marco Polo, and drive down the error close to zero. As it does that, it's getting
successive approximations to w. Typically, it never quite gets there,
but after about a dozen steps, we're up to w = 2.999,
which is close enough. And this is the learning process. 10:18So remember that what's been going on here is that we've been taking
a lot of known x's and known y's and solving for the w in the middle
through an iterative process. It's exactly the same way
that we do our own learning. We have many, many images as babies and we get told, ""This is a bird;
this is not a bird."" And over time, through iteration, we solve for w, we solve
for those neural connections. 10:43So now, we've held
x and w fixed to solve for y; that's everyday, fast perception. We figure out how we can solve for w, that's learning, which is a lot harder, because we need to do error minimization, using a lot of training examples. 10:56And about a year ago,
Alex Mordvintsev, on our team, decided to experiment
with what happens if we try solving for x, given a known w and a known y. In other words, you know that it's a bird, and you already have your neural network
that you've trained on birds, but what is the picture of a bird? It turns out that by using exactly
the same error-minimization procedure, one can do that with the network
trained to recognize birds, and the result turns out to be ... a picture of birds. So this is a picture of birds
generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds, just by solving for x
rather than solving for y, and doing that iteratively. 11:43Here's another fun example. This was a work made
by Mike Tyka in our group, which he calls ""Animal Parade."" It reminds me a little bit
of William Kentridge's artworks, in which he makes sketches, rubs them out, makes sketches, rubs them out, and creates a movie this way. In this case, what Mike is doing is varying y
over the space of different animals, in a network designed
to recognize and distinguish different animals from each other. And you get this strange, Escher-like
morph from one animal to another. 12:14Here he and Alex together
have tried reducing the y's to a space of only two dimensions, thereby making a map
out of the space of all things recognized by this network. Doing this kind of synthesis or generation of imagery
over that entire surface, varying y over the surface,
you make a kind of map -- a visual map of all the things
the network knows how to recognize. The animals are all here;
""armadillo"" is right in that spot. 12:40You can do this with other kinds
of networks as well. This is a network designed
to recognize faces, to distinguish one face from another. And here, we're putting
in a y that says, ""me,"" my own face parameters. And when this thing solves for x, it generates this rather crazy, kind of cubist, surreal,
psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once. The reason it looks like
multiple points of view at once is because that network is designed
to get rid of the ambiguity of a face being in one pose
or another pose, being looked at with one kind of lighting,
another kind of lighting. So when you do
this sort of reconstruction, if you don't use some sort of guide image or guide statistics, then you'll get a sort of confusion
of different points of view, because it's ambiguous. This is what happens if Alex uses
his own face as a guide image during that optimization process
to reconstruct my own face. So you can see it's not perfect. There's still quite a lot of work to do on how we optimize
that optimization process. But you start to get something
more like a coherent face, rendered using my own face as a guide. 13:48You don't have to start
with a blank canvas or with white noise. When you're solving for x, you can begin with an x,
that is itself already some other image. That's what this little demonstration is. This is a network
that is designed to categorize all sorts of different objects --
man-made structures, animals ... Here we're starting
with just a picture of clouds, and as we optimize, basically, this network is figuring out
what it sees in the clouds. And the more time
you spend looking at this, the more things you also
will see in the clouds. You could also use the face network
to hallucinate into this, and you get some pretty crazy stuff. 14:28(Laughter) 14:30Or, Mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image, hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates,
zooms hallucinates, zooms. And in this way, you can get a sort of fugue state
of the network, I suppose, or a sort of free association, in which the network
is eating its own tail. So every image is now the basis for, ""What do I think I see next? What do I think I see next?
What do I think I see next?"" 14:59I showed this for the first time in public to a group at a lecture in Seattle
called ""Higher Education"" -- this was right after
marijuana was legalized. 15:10(Laughter) 15:14So I'd like to finish up quickly by just noting that this technology
is not constrained. I've shown you purely visual examples
because they're really fun to look at. It's not a purely visual technology. Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin, has done experiments involving
a camera that takes a picture, and then a computer in his backpack
writes a poem using neural networks, based on the contents of the image. And that poetry neural network
has been trained on a large corpus of 20th-century poetry. And the poetry is, you know, I think, kind of not bad, actually. 15:47(Laughter) 15:49In closing, I think that per Michelangelo, I think he was right; perception and creativity
are very intimately connected. What we've just seen are neural networks that are entirely trained to discriminate, or to recognize different
things in the world, able to be run in reverse, to generate. One of the things that suggests to me is not only that
Michelangelo really did see the sculpture in the blocks of stone, but that any creature,
any being, any alien that is able to do
perceptual acts of that sort is also able to create because it's exactly the same
machinery that's used in both cases. 16:26Also, I think that perception
and creativity are by no means uniquely human. We start to have computer models
that can do exactly these sorts of things. And that ought to be unsurprising;
the brain is computational. 16:39And finally, computing began as an exercise
in designing intelligent machinery. It was very much modeled after the idea of how could we make machines intelligent. And we finally are starting to fulfill now some of the promises
of those early pioneers, of Turing and von Neumann and McCulloch and Pitts. And I think that computing
is not just about accounting or playing Candy Crush or something. From the beginning,
we modeled them after our minds. And they give us both the ability
to understand our own minds better and to extend them. 17:14Thank you very much. 17:15(Applause)"

that we're showing here, for the first time at TED,
and here's how it works. 01:24Normally, when we speak, the brain sends neurosignals
through the nerves to your internal speech systems, to activate them and your vocal cords
to produce speech. One of the most complex
cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings. Now, imagine talking to yourself without vocalizing,
without moving your mouth, without moving your jaw, but by simply articulating
those words internally. Thereby very subtly engaging
your internal speech systems, such as your tongue
and back of your palate. When that happens, the brain sends extremely weak signals
to these internal speech systems. 02:05AlterEgo has sensors, embedded in a thin plastic,
flexible and transparent device that sits on your neck
just like a sticker. These sensors pick up
on these internal signals sourced deep within the mouth cavity, right from the surface of the skin. An AI program running in the background then tries to figure out
what the user's trying to say. It then feeds back an answer to the user by means of bone conduction, audio conducted through the skull
into the user's inner ear, that the user hears, overlaid on top of the user's
natural hearing of the environment, without blocking it. 02:46The combination of all these parts,
the input, the output and the AI, gives a net subjective experience
of an interface inside your head that you could talk to
in likeness to talking to yourself. Just to be very clear, the device
does not record or read your thoughts. It records deliberate information
that you want to communicate through deliberate engagement
of your internal speech systems. People don't want to be read,
they want to write. Which is why we designed the system to deliberately record
from the peripheral nervous system. Which is why the control
in all situations resides with the user. 03:25I want to stop here for a second
and show you a live demo. What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to ask Eric a question. And he's going to search
for that information without vocalizing, without typing,
without moving his fingers, without moving his mouth. Simply by internally asking that question. The AI will then figure out the answer
and feed it back to Eric, through audio, through the device. While you see a laptop
in front of him, he's not using it. Everything lives on the device. All he needs is that sticker device
to interface with the AI and the internet. So, Eric, what's the weather
in Vancouver like, right now? What you see on the screen are the words that Eric
is speaking to himself right now. This is happening in real time. 04:19Eric: It's 50 degrees
and rainy here in Vancouver. 04:23Arnav Kapur: What happened is
that the AI sent the answer through audio, through
the device, back to Eric. 04:29What could the implications
of something like this be? Imagine perfectly memorizing things, where you perfectly record information
that you silently speak, and then hear them later when you want to, internally searching for information, crunching numbers at speeds computers do, silently texting other people. Suddenly becoming multilingual, so that you internally
speak in one language, and hear the translation
in your head in another. The potential could be far-reaching. 05:00There are millions of people
around the world who struggle with using natural speech. People with conditions such as ALS,
or Lou Gehrig's disease, stroke and oral cancer, amongst many other conditions. For them, communicating is
a painstakingly slow and tiring process. 05:18This is Doug. Doug was diagnosed with ALS
about 12 years ago and has since lost the ability to speak. Today, he uses an on-screen keyboard where he types in individual letters
using his head movements. And it takes several minutes
to communicate a single sentence. So we went to Doug and asked him what were the first words
he'd like to use or say, using our system. Perhaps a greeting, like,
""Hello, how are you?"" Or indicate that he needed
help with something. What Doug said that he wanted
to use our system for is to reboot the old system he had,
because that old system kept on crashing. 05:55(Laughter) 05:58We never could have predicted that. I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug
using our system for the first time. 06:10(Voice) Reboot computer. 06:14AK: What you just saw there was Doug communicating or speaking
in real time for the first time since he lost the ability to speak. There are millions of people who might be able to communicate
in real time like Doug, with other people, with their friends
and with their families. My hope is to be able to help them
express their thoughts and ideas. 06:36I believe computing, AI and the internet would disappear into us
as extensions of our cognition, instead of being external
entities or adversaries, amplifying human ingenuity, giving us unimaginable abilities
and unlocking our true potential. And perhaps even freeing us
to becoming better at being human. 06:58Thank you so much. 06:59(Applause) 07:05Shoham Arad: Come over here. OK. I want to ask you a couple of questions,
they're going to clear the stage. I feel like this is amazing,
it's innovative, it's creepy, it's terrifying. Can you tell us what I think ... I think there are some
uncomfortable feelings around this. Tell us, is this reading your thoughts, will it in five years, is there a weaponized version of this,
what does it look like? 07:36AK: So our first design principle,
before we started working on this, was to not render ethics
as an afterthought. So we wanted to bake ethics
right into the design. We flipped the design. Instead of reading
from the brain directly, we're reading from
the voluntary nervous system that you deliberately have to engage
to communicate with the device, while still bringing the benefits
of a thinking or a thought device. The best of both worlds in a way. 08:00SA: OK, I think people are going to have
a lot more questions for you. Also, you said that it's a sticker. So right now it sits just right here? Is that the final iteration, what the final design you hope looks like? 08:14AK: Our goal is for the technology
to disappear completely. 08:18SA: What does that mean? 08:20AK: If you're wearing it,
I shouldn't be able to see it. You don't want technology on your face,
you want it in the background, to augment you in the background. So we have a sticker version
that conforms to the skin, that looks like the skin, but we're trying to make
an even smaller version that would sit right here. 08:37SA: OK. I feel like if anyone has any questions
they want to ask Arnav, he'll be here all week. OK, thank you so much, Arnav. 08:44AK: Thanks, Shoham."

Sherry Turkle studies how our devices and online personas are redefining human connection and communication -- and asks us to think deeply about the new kinds of connection we want to have.", (224K),"Transcript (36 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Just a moment ago, my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck. Her text said, ""Mom, you will rock."" I love this. Getting that text was like getting a hug. And so there you have it. I embody the central paradox. I'm a woman who loves getting texts who's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem. 00:33Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story. 1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk, Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row. I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine. In those heady days, we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities. We were exploring different aspects of ourselves. And then we unplugged. I was excited. And, as a psychologist, what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves, about our identity, to live better lives in the real world. 01:27Now fast-forward to 2012. I'm back here on the TED stage again. My daughter's 20. She's a college student. She sleeps with her cellphone, so do I. And I've just written a new book, but this time it's not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine. So what happened? I'm still excited by technology, but I believe, and I'm here to make the case, that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go. 02:06Over the past 15 years, I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people, young and old, about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are. Some of the things we do now with our devices are things that, only a few years ago, we would have found odd or disturbing, but they've quickly come to seem familiar, just how we do things. 02:48So just to take some quick examples: People text or do email during corporate board meetings. They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes, during presentations, actually during all meetings. People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you're texting. (Laughter) People explain to me that it's hard, but that it can be done. Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents' full attention. But then these same children deny each other their full attention. This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together. And we even text at funerals. I study this. We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. 03:53Why does this matter? It matters to me because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble -- trouble certainly in how we relate to each other, but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection. We're getting used to a new way of being alone together. People want to be with each other, but also elsewhere -- connected to all the different places they want to be. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention. So you want to go to that board meeting, but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. And some people think that's a good thing. But you can end up hiding from each other, even as we're all constantly connected to each other. 04:53A 50-year-old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work. When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody, he doesn't call. And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues because, he says, ""They're too busy on their email."" But then he stops himself and he says, ""You know, I'm not telling you the truth. I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted. I think I should want to, but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."" 05:24Across the generations, I see that people can't get enough of each other, if and only if they can have each other at a distance, in amounts they can control. I call it the Goldilocks effect: not too close, not too far, just right. But what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships. An 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully, ""Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."" 06:11When I ask people ""What's wrong with having a conversation?"" People say, ""I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation. It takes place in real time and you can't control what you're going to say."" So that's the bottom line. Texting, email, posting, all of these things let us present the self as we want to be. We get to edit, and that means we get to delete, and that means we get to retouch, the face, the voice, the flesh, the body -- not too little, not too much, just right. 06:54Human relationships are rich and they're messy and they're demanding. And we clean them up with technology. And when we do, one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection. We short-change ourselves. And over time, we seem to forget this, or we seem to stop caring. 07:21I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question, a profound question. He said, ""Don't all those little tweets, don't all those little sips of online communication, add up to one big gulp of real conversation?"" My answer was no, they don't add up. Connecting in sips may work for gathering discrete bits of information, they may work for saying, ""I'm thinking about you,"" or even for saying, ""I love you,"" -- I mean, look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter -- but they don't really work for learning about each other, for really coming to know and understand each other. And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves. So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection. For kids growing up, that skill is the bedrock of development. 08:46Over and over I hear, ""I would rather text than talk."" And what I'm seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation, so used to getting by with less, that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether. So for example, many people share with me this wish, that some day a more advanced version of Siri, the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone, will be more like a best friend, someone who will listen when others won't. I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I've learned in the past 15 years. That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology. That's why it's so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed -- so many automatic listeners. And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us. 09:52We're developing robots, they call them sociable robots, that are specifically designed to be companions -- to the elderly, to our children, to us. Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other? During my research I worked in nursing homes, and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood. And one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal. It seemed to be looking in her eyes. It seemed to be following the conversation. It comforted her. And many people found this amazing. 10:45But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life. That robot put on a great show. And we're vulnerable. People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing. So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy, I was thinking, ""That robot can't empathize. It doesn't face death. It doesn't know life."" 11:22And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion, I didn't find it amazing; I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments in my 15 years of work. But when I stepped back, I felt myself at the cold, hard center of a perfect storm. We expect more from technology and less from each other. And I ask myself, ""Why have things come to this?"" 11:56And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control. 12:30These days, those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies. One, that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; two, that we will always be heard; and three, that we will never have to be alone. And that third idea, that we will never have to be alone, is central to changing our psyches. Because the moment that people are alone, even for a few seconds, they become anxious, they panic, they fidget, they reach for a device. Just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light. Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved. And so people try to solve it by connecting. But here, connection is more like a symptom than a cure. It expresses, but it doesn't solve, an underlying problem. But more than a symptom, constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves. It's shaping a new way of being. 13:36The best way to describe it is, I share therefore I am. We use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we're having them. So before it was: I have a feeling, I want to make a call. Now it's: I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. The problem with this new regime of ""I share therefore I am"" is that, if we don't have connection, we don't feel like ourselves. We almost don't feel ourselves. So what do we do? We connect more and more. But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated. 14:18How do you get from connection to isolation? You end up isolated if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude, the ability to be separate, to gather yourself. Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments. When we don't have the capacity for solitude, we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive. When this happens, we're not able to appreciate who they are. It's as though we're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self. We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone. But we're at risk, because actually it's the opposite that's true. If we're not able to be alone, we're going to be more lonely. And if we don't teach our children to be alone, they're only going to know how to be lonely. 15:22When I spoke at TED in 1996, reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities, I said, ""Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."" And that's what I'm calling for here, now: reflection and, more than that, a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us, what it might be costing us. We're smitten with technology. And we're afraid, like young lovers, that too much talking might spoil the romance. But it's time to talk. We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. But it's not, it's early days. There's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it, how we build it. I'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices, just that we develop a more self-aware relationship with them, with each other and with ourselves. 16:27I see some first steps. Start thinking of solitude as a good thing. Make room for it. Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children. Create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen, the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation. Do the same thing at work. At work, we're so busy communicating that we often don't have time to think, we don't have time to talk, about the things that really matter. Change that. Most important, we all really need to listen to each other, including to the boring bits. Because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other. 17:18Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other, how we care for ourselves -- but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. I'm optimistic. We have everything we need to start. We have each other. And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler. 17:56So in my work, I hear that life is hard, relationships are filled with risk. And then there's technology -- simpler, hopeful, optimistic, ever-young. It's like calling in the cavalry. An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars, you can ""Finally, love your friends love your body, love your life, online and with avatars."" We're drawn to virtual romance, to computer games that seem like worlds, to the idea that robots, robots, will someday be our true companions. We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends. 18:44But our fantasies of substitution have cost us. Now we all need to focus on the many, many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives, our own bodies, our own communities, our own politics, our own planet. They need us. Let's talk about how we can use digital technology, the technology of our dreams, to make this life the life we can love. 19:19Thank you. 19:21(Applause)"

And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them. 00:27So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home, ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot. Three years later -- a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. 01:15(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something. 01:17Kismet: (Nonsense) 01:19Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. 01:22Kismet: (Nonsense) 01:24Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. 01:29Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child, which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. 01:49So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. 02:18(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo. Leo, this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster? Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad, Leo. Cookie Monster is very, very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies. 02:57(Laughter) 02:59CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now. 03:07So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say ""push our social buttons?"" Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots. 03:58It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter, we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is? Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how? Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters? It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot, you can. 04:28And so in this video here -- this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology. So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone? You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it? 05:18To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base. This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot. 06:06So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person? We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference. 06:39Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me, I have three young boys, and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma-bot, she can now play, really play, with my sons, with her grandsons, in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters, with their friends, and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house, like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology, being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. 07:43Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health. So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life, if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life, but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy -- as in the well-known fairy tale -- a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab. 08:31This is a robot, Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you. 09:09So an interesting question is, does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot? Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? To explore that question, we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program. 09:43So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. (Laughter) And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. (Laughter) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer. 10:39The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play, like, real-world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play. 11:33But we can push this idea further. What if -- (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! CB: -- the character itself could come into your world? It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2. You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power. 12:17And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching ""Star Wars."" But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very, very important. 13:01So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people. 13:35Thank you. 13:37(Applause)"
2,How to keep human bias out of AI,Kriti Sharma,Mar 2019,"AI algorithms make important decisions about you all the time -- like how much you should pay for car insurance or whether or not you get that job interview. But what happens when these machines are built with human bias coded into their systems? Technologist Kriti Sharma explores how the lack of diversity in tech is creeping into our AI, offering three ways we can start making more ethical algorithms.", (69K),"Transcript (17 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00How many decisions
have been made about you today, or this week or this year, by artificial intelligence? I build AI for a living so, full disclosure, I'm kind of a nerd. And because I'm kind of a nerd, wherever some new news story comes out about artificial intelligence
stealing all our jobs, or robots getting citizenship
of an actual country, I'm the person my friends
and followers message freaking out about the future. 00:33We see this everywhere. This media panic that
our robot overlords are taking over. We could blame Hollywood for that. But in reality, that's not the problem
we should be focusing on. There is a more pressing danger,
a bigger risk with AI, that we need to fix first. So we are back to this question: How many decisions
have been made about you today by AI? And how many of these were based on your gender,
your race or your background? 01:12Algorithms are being used all the time to make decisions about who we are
and what we want. Some of the women in this room
will know what I'm talking about if you've been made to sit through
those pregnancy test adverts on YouTube like 1,000 times. Or you've scrolled past adverts
of fertility clinics on your Facebook feed. Or in my case, Indian marriage bureaus. 01:38(Laughter) 01:39But AI isn't just being used
to make decisions about what products we want to buy or which show we want to binge watch next. I wonder how you'd feel about someone
who thought things like this: ""A black or Latino person is less likely than a white person
to pay off their loan on time."" ""A person called John
makes a better programmer than a person called Mary."" ""A black man is more likely to be
a repeat offender than a white man."" You're probably thinking, ""Wow, that sounds like a pretty sexist,
racist person,"" right? These are some real decisions
that AI has made very recently, based on the biases
it has learned from us, from the humans. AI is being used to help decide
whether or not you get that job interview; how much you pay for your car insurance; how good your credit score is; and even what rating you get
in your annual performance review. But these decisions
are all being filtered through its assumptions about our identity,
our race, our gender, our age. How is that happening? 02:58footnotefootnoteNow, imagine an AI is helping
a hiring manager find the next tech leader in the company. So far, the manager
has been hiring mostly men. So the AI learns men are more likely
to be programmers than women. And it's a very short leap from there to: men make better programmers than women. We have reinforced
our own bias into the AI. And now, it's screening out
female candidates. Hang on, if a human
hiring manager did that, we'd be outraged, we wouldn't allow it. This kind of gender
discrimination is not OK. And yet somehow,
AI has become above the law, because a machine made the decision. That's not it. 03:47We are also reinforcing our bias
in how we interact with AI. How often do you use a voice assistant
like Siri, Alexa or even Cortana? They all have two things in common: one, they can never get my name right, and second, they are all female. They are designed to be
our obedient servants, turning your lights on and off,
ordering your shopping. You get male AIs too,
but they tend to be more high-powered, like IBM Watson,
making business decisions, Salesforce Einstein
or ROSS, the robot lawyer. So poor robots, even they suffer
from sexism in the workplace. 04:30(Laughter) 04:32footnotefootnoteThink about how these two things combine and affect a kid growing up
in today's world around AI. So they're doing some research
for a school project and they Google images of CEO. The algorithm shows them
results of mostly men. And now, they Google personal assistant. As you can guess,
it shows them mostly females. And then they want to put on some music,
and maybe order some food, and now, they are barking orders
at an obedient female voice assistant. Some of our brightest minds
are creating this technology today. Technology that they could have created
in any way they wanted. And yet, they have chosen to create it
in the style of 1950s ""Mad Man"" secretary. Yay! 05:24But OK, don't worry, this is not going to end
with me telling you that we are all heading towards
sexist, racist machines running the world. The good news about AI
is that it is entirely within our control. We get to teach the right values,
the right ethics to AI. So there are three things we can do. One, we can be aware of our own biases and the bias in machines around us. Two, we can make sure that diverse teams
are building this technology. And three, we have to give it
diverse experiences to learn from. I can talk about the first two
from personal experience. When you work in technology and you don't look like
a Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, your life is a little bit difficult,
your ability gets questioned. 06:15Here's just one example. Like most developers,
I often join online tech forums and share my knowledge to help others. And I've found, when I log on as myself,
with my own photo, my own name, I tend to get questions
or comments like this: ""What makes you think
you're qualified to talk about AI?"" ""What makes you think
you know about machine learning?"" So, as you do, I made a new profile, and this time, instead of my own picture,
I chose a cat with a jet pack on it. And I chose a name
that did not reveal my gender. You can probably guess
where this is going, right? So, this time, I didn't get any of those
patronizing comments about my ability and I was able to actually
get some work done. And it sucks, guys. I've been building robots since I was 15, I have a few degrees in computer science, and yet, I had to hide my gender in order for my work
to be taken seriously. 07:19footnotefootnoteSo, what's going on here? Are men just better
at technology than women? Another study found that when women coders on one platform
hid their gender, like myself, their code was accepted
four percent more than men. So this is not about the talent. This is about an elitism in AI that says a programmer
needs to look like a certain person. What we really need to do
to make AI better is bring people
from all kinds of backgrounds. We need people who can
write and tell stories to help us create personalities of AI. We need people who can solve problems. We need people
who face different challenges and we need people who can tell us
what are the real issues that need fixing and help us find ways
that technology can actually fix it. Because, when people
from diverse backgrounds come together, when we build things in the right way, the possibilities are limitless. 08:26footnotefootnoteAnd that's what I want to end
by talking to you about. Less racist robots, less machines
that are going to take our jobs -- and more about what technology
can actually achieve. So, yes, some of the energy
in the world of AI, in the world of technology is going to be about
what ads you see on your stream. But a lot of it is going towards
making the world so much better. Think about a pregnant woman
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who has to walk 17 hours
to her nearest rural prenatal clinic to get a checkup. What if she could get diagnosis
on her phone, instead? Or think about what AI could do for those one in three women
in South Africa who face domestic violence. If it wasn't safe to talk out loud, they could get an AI service
to raise alarm, get financial and legal advice. These are all real examples of projects
that people, including myself, are working on right now, using AI. 09:33So, I'm sure in the next couple of days
there will be yet another news story about the existential risk, robots taking over
and coming for your jobs. 09:42(Laughter) 09:43And when something like that happens, I know I'll get the same messages
worrying about the future. But I feel incredibly positive
about this technology. This is our chance to remake the world
into a much more equal place. But to do that, we need to build it
the right way from the get go. We need people of different genders,
races, sexualities and backgrounds. We need women to be the makers and not just the machines
who do the makers' bidding. We need to think very carefully
what we teach machines, what data we give them, so they don't just repeat
our own past mistakes. So I hope I leave you
thinking about two things. First, I hope you leave
thinking about bias today. And that the next time
you scroll past an advert that assumes you are interested
in fertility clinics or online betting websites, that you think and remember that the same technology is assuming
that a black man will reoffend. Or that a woman is more likely
to be a personal assistant than a CEO. And I hope that reminds you
that we need to do something about it. 11:08And second, I hope you think about the fact that you don't need to look a certain way or have a certain background
in engineering or technology to create AI, which is going to be
a phenomenal force for our future. You don't need to look
like a Mark Zuckerberg, you can look like me. And it is up to all of us in this room to convince the governments
and the corporations to build AI technology for everyone, including the edge cases. And for us all to get education about this phenomenal
technology in the future. Because if we do that, then we've only just scratched the surface
of what we can achieve with AI. 11:53Thank you. 11:54(Applause)"
2,"Watson, Jeopardy and me, the obsolete know-it-all",Ken Jennings,Apr 2013,"Trivia whiz Ken Jennings has made a career as a keeper of facts; he holds the longest winning streak in history on the US quiz show Jeopardy.

I mean, nine years is a long time. And given ""Jeopardy's"" average demographics, I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead. (Laughter) But not all, a few are still alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever. And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all. I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me. For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as, as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. 00:32And I can't complain about this. I feel like that was always sort of my destiny, although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet. If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager, it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name. (Laughter) And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years. But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about -- Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was. I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same. And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work. (Laughter) 01:15And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows. I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school, that I was also going to miss ""Hollywood Squares"" and ""Family Feud."" I was going to miss my game shows. And later, in the mid-'80s, when ""Jeopardy"" came back on the air, I remember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house. And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working, where there was only one English language TV channel. There was Armed Forces TV, and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching. So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch ""Jeopardy."" 01:56I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid. I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s and holding my own, back when that was a fad. There's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know. You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power -- the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. 02:26I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path, that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex-game show contestant. And so I sold out way too young. I didn't try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing, and I became a computer programmer -- not an especially good one, not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on ""Jeopardy"" in 2004. But that's what I was doing. 02:52And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background -- a few years later, I think 2009 or so, when I got another phone call from ""Jeopardy"" saying, ""It's early days yet, but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this?"" This was the first I'd heard of it. And of course I said yes, for several reasons. One, because playing ""Jeopardy"" is a great time. It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on. (Laughter) And I would do it for nothing. I don't think they know that, luckily, but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons. I just love ""Jeopardy,"" and I always have. And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future. People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future, and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say no. 03:43The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on ""Jeopardy."" People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a ""Jeopardy"" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings, unpack the meaning of the clue. The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do, very hard for a computer. And I thought, well this is going to be child's play. Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. (Laughter) 04:23But as the years went on, as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this, I started to get occasional updates from them, and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. It was a scatter chart showing performance on ""Jeopardy,"" tens of thousands of dots representing ""Jeopardy"" champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of -- I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess, clues responded to -- versus the accuracy of those answers. So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first, it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. But then you see the line start to go up. And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color. And thought, what are these? ""The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."" And I saw this line coming for me. And I realized, this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. (Laughter) It's not the Terminator's gun sight; it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do, the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at. 05:40And when the game eventually happened about a year later, it was very different than the ""Jeopardy"" games I'd been used to. We were not playing in L.A. on the regular ""Jeopardy"" set. Watson does not travel. Watson's actually huge. It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory, trillions of bytes of memory. We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room. The only other ""Jeopardy"" contestant to this day I've ever been inside. And so Watson does not travel. You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage. 06:13So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer. And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage. Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls, and there's the thing in the middle of their court. And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling, having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up, and holding up ""Go Watson"" signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. I think guys had ""W-A-T-S-O-N"" written on their bellies in grease paint. If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters ""W-A-T-S-O-N"" written on their gut, it's an unpleasant sight. 07:04But they were right. They were exactly right. I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR, but Watson won handily. And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking. It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick. And I remember thinking, this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it hasn't been the last. 07:47If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally -- and I see this all the time -- that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You don't need human assistants for that anymore. I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they're replacing, but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies, we'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren. I've heard other people say quite the opposite, that this is yet another tier of the middle class that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous, something that we should worry about. 08:58I'm not an economist myself. All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV, and ""I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."" And it made me think, what does this mean, if we're going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions. I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers. And suddenly there was a machine that did that, and now we don't need to remember that anymore. I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS, because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore. We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber. And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are? Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that? Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less? As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know, this was a terrifying idea to me. 10:28The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important. The things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says, ""Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."" There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time. 10:49The advantage of volume, first, just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays. There's so much information out there. Being a Renaissance man or woman, that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance. Now it's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor. There's just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so, the sum total of human information. That means between now and late 2014, we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes, as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together. It's doubling every 18 months now. This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts. A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in? Who do I vote for? Do I take this job or that one? These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts at our mental fingertips, we're going to be able to make informed decisions. If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up, we may be in trouble. According to a National Geographic survey I just saw, somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. If you can't do that first step, are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy? Quite probably not. At some point you're just going to be like, ""You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."" And you'll make a less informed decision. 12:20The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips. I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says, ""Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."" And they say, ""What do you mean? We just got here."" And she said, ""In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month, he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there, that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."" What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this? Her parents thought about it, and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her. They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel, and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily, because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas, 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. 13:21Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case it happened in real life. And it happens in real life all the time. It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation. It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You say where you're from, and I say, ""Oh, yeah."" Or your alma mater or your job, and I know just a little something about it, enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met. That's often the advantage of time. And it's not effective if you say, ""Well, hold on. You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."" That doesn't work. That's just annoying. (Laughter) 14:21The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson, Samuel Parr once said, ""It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."" And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that. I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good, that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are, as individuals and as a species. I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty, so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all sitting on a mountain somewhere, reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of ""Simpsons"" episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs. I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices, to our search engines and our smartphones. 15:28In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think, things don't always end well. Those movies are never about beautiful utopias. It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in ""2001."" Things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership, because it becomes a question of who leads the future. On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips. And on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore, that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud, and why would we ever bother learning anything new. 16:31Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in. And we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn, who don't just say, ""Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over, I don't have to learn anymore,"" or ""Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime. I don't have to learn new things anymore."" No, every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us. That's where the people you see on ""Jeopardy"" come from. These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. I've met a lot of them. For the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything, thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. 17:16We can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know, continue to be the thing that makes us special, or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson. Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours. 17:32Thank you very much."
2,Technology that knows what you're feeling,Poppy Crum,Jun 2018,"What happens when technology knows more about us than we do? Poppy Crum studies how we express emotions -- and she suggests the end of the poker face is near, as new tech makes it easy to see the signals that give away how we're feeling.

knows more about us than we do? A computer now can detect
our slightest facial microexpressions and be able to tell the difference
between a real smile and a fake one. That's only the beginning. Technology has become
incredibly intelligent and already knows a lot
about our internal states. And whether we like it or not, we already are sharing
parts of our inner lives that's out of our control. That seems like a problem, because a lot of us like to keep
what's going on inside from what people actually see. We want to have agency
over what we share and what we don't. We all like to have a poker face. 00:47But I'm here to tell you
that I think that's a thing of the past. And while that might sound scary,
it's not necessarily a bad thing. I've spent a lot of time
studying the circuits in the brain that create the unique perceptual
realities that we each have. And now I bring that together with the capabilities
of current technology to create new technology
that does make us better, feel more, connect more. And I believe to do that, we have to be OK
losing some of our agency. 01:18With some animals, it's really amazing, and we get to see into
their internal experiences. We get this upfront look
at the mechanistic interaction between how they respond
to the world around them and the state of their biological systems. This is where evolutionary pressures
like eating, mating and making sure we don't get eaten drive deterministic behavioral responses
to information in the world. And we get to see into this window, into their internal states
and their biological experiences. It's really pretty cool. Now, stay with me for a moment --
I'm a violinist, not a singer. But the spider's already
given me a critical review. 02:04(Video) (Singing in a low pitch) 02:07(Singing in a middle pitch) 02:11(Singing in a high pitch) 02:15(Singing in a low pitch) 02:17(Singing in a middle pitch) 02:19(Singing in a high pitch) 02:21(Laughter) 02:24Poppy Crum: It turns out, some spiders
tune their webs like violins to resonate with certain sounds. And likely, the harmonics
of my voice as it went higher coupled with how loud I was singing recreated either the predatory call
of an echolocating bat or a bird, and the spider did what it should. It predictively told me to bug off. I love this. The spider's responding
to its external world in a way that we get to see and know
what's happening to its internal world. Biology is controlling
the spider's response; it's wearing its internal
state on its sleeve. 03:01But us, humans -- we're different. We like to think we have cognitive control
over what people see, know and understand about our internal states -- our emotions, our insecurities,
our bluffs, our trials and tribulations -- and how we respond. We get to have our poker face. 03:23Or maybe we don't. Try this with me. Your eye responds
to how hard your brain is working. The response you're about to see
is driven entirely by mental effort and has nothing to do
with changes in lighting. We know this from neuroscience. I promise, your eyes are doing
the same thing as the subject in our lab, whether you want them to or not. At first, you'll hear some voices. Try and understand them
and keep watching the eye in front of you. It's going to be hard at first, one should drop out,
and it should get really easy. You're going to see the change in effort
in the diameter of the pupil. 03:58(Video) (Two overlapping voices talking) 04:00(Single voice) Intelligent technology
depends on personal data. 04:03(Two overlapping voices talking) 04:06(Single voice) Intelligent technology
depends on personal data. 04:09PC: Your pupil doesn't lie. Your eye gives away your poker face. When your brain's having to work harder, your autonomic nervous system
drives your pupil to dilate. When it's not, it contracts. When I take away one of the voices, the cognitive effort
to understand the talkers gets a lot easier. I could have put the two voices
in different spatial locations, I could have made one louder. You would have seen the same thing. We might think we have more agency
over the reveal of our internal state than that spider, but maybe we don't. 04:41Today's technology is starting
to make it really easy to see the signals and tells
that give us away. The amalgamation of sensors
paired with machine learning on us, around us and in our environments, is a lot more than cameras and microphones
tracking our external actions. 05:00Our bodies radiate our stories from changes in the temperature
of our physiology. We can look at these
as infrared thermal images showing up behind me, where reds are hotter
and blues are cooler. The dynamic signature
of our thermal response gives away our changes in stress, how hard our brain is working, whether we're paying attention and engaged in the conversation
we might be having and even whether we're experiencing
a picture of fire as if it were real. We can actually see
people give off heat on their cheeks in response to an image of flame. 05:36But aside from giving away
our poker bluffs, what if dimensions of data
from someone's thermal response gave away a glow
of interpersonal interest? Tracking the honesty of feelings
in someone's thermal image might be a new part of how
we fall in love and see attraction. Our technology can listen,
develop insights and make predictions about our mental and physical health just by analyzing the timing dynamics
of our speech and language picked up by microphones. Groups have shown that changes
in the statistics of our language paired with machine learning can predict the likelihood
someone will develop psychosis. 06:15I'm going to take it a step further and look at linguistic changes
and changes in our voice that show up with a lot
of different conditions. Dementia, diabetes can alter
the spectral coloration of our voice. Changes in our language
associated with Alzheimer's can sometimes show up more
than 10 years before clinical diagnosis. What we say and how we say it
tells a much richer story than we used to think. And devices we already have in our homes
could, if we let them, give us invaluable insight back. The chemical composition of our breath gives away our feelings. There's a dynamic mixture of acetone,
isoprene and carbon dioxide that changes when our heart speeds up,
when our muscles tense, and all without any obvious change
in our behaviors. 07:06Alright, I want you to watch
this clip with me. Some things might be going on
on the side screens, but try and focus on
the image in the front and the man at the window. 07:19(Eerie music) 07:27(Woman screams) 07:38PC: Sorry about that.
I needed to get a reaction. 07:41(Laughter) 07:43I'm actually tracking the carbon dioxide
you exhale in the room right now. We've installed tubes
throughout the theater, lower to the ground,
because CO2 is heavier than air. But they're connected
to a device in the back that lets us measure, in real time,
with high precision, the continuous differential
concentration of CO2. The clouds on the sides are actually
the real-time data visualization of the density of our CO2. You might still see
a patch of red on the screen, because we're showing increases
with larger colored clouds, larger colored areas of red. And that's the point
where a lot of us jumped. It's our collective suspense
driving a change in carbon dioxide. Alright, now, watch this
with me one more time. 08:34(Cheerful music) 08:42(Woman laughs) 08:53PC: You knew it was coming. But it's a lot different
when we changed the creator's intent. Changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional
impact of that scene. And we can see it in our breath. Suspense, fear, joy all show up as reproducible,
visually identifiable moments. We broadcast a chemical signature
of our emotions. It is the end of the poker face. 09:26Our spaces, our technology
will know what we're feeling. We will know more about each other
than we ever have. We get a chance to reach in and connect
to the experience and sentiments that are fundamental to us as humans in our senses, emotionally and socially. I believe it is the era of the empath. And we are enabling the capabilities
that true technological partners can bring to how we connect with each other
and with our technology. If we recognize the power
of becoming technological empaths, we get this opportunity where technology can help us bridge
the emotional and cognitive divide. And in that way, we get to change
how we tell our stories. We can enable a better future
for technologies like augmented reality to extend our own agency
and connect us at a much deeper level. 10:15Imagine a high school counselor
being able to realize that an outwardly cheery student
really was having a deeply hard time, where reaching out can make
a crucial, positive difference. Or authorities, being able
to know the difference between someone having
a mental health crisis and a different type of aggression, and responding accordingly. Or an artist, knowing
the direct impact of their work. Leo Tolstoy defined his perspective of art by whether what the creator intended was experienced by the person
on the other end. Today's artists can know
what we're feeling. But regardless of whether
it's art or human connection, today's technologies
will know and can know what we're experiencing on the other side, and this means we can be
closer and more authentic. 11:02But I realize a lot of us
have a really hard time with the idea of sharing our data, and especially the idea
that people know things about us that we didn't actively choose to share. Anytime we talk to someone, look at someone or choose not to look, data is exchanged, given away, that people use to learn, make decisions about
their lives and about ours. 11:33I'm not looking to create a world
where our inner lives are ripped open and our personal data
and our privacy given away to people and entities
where we don't want to see it go. But I am looking to create a world where we can care about
each other more effectively, we can know more about when
someone is feeling something that we ought to pay attention to. And we can have richer experiences
from our technology. 11:58Any technology
can be used for good or bad. Transparency to engagement
and effective regulation are absolutely critical
to building the trust for any of this. But the benefits that ""empathetic
technology"" can bring to our lives are worth solving the problems
that make us uncomfortable. And if we don't, there are
too many opportunities and feelings we're going to be missing out on. 12:23Thank you. 12:24(Applause)"
2,Machine intelligence makes human morals more important,Zeynep Tufekci,Oct 2016,"Machine intelligence is here, and we're already using it to make subjective decisions.

as a computer programmer in my very first year of college -- basically, as a teenager. 00:08Soon after I started working, writing software in a company, a manager who worked at the company
came down to where I was, and he whispered to me, ""Can he tell if I'm lying?"" There was nobody else in the room. 00:25""Can who tell if you're lying?
And why are we whispering?"" 00:30The manager pointed
at the computer in the room. ""Can he tell if I'm lying?"" Well, that manager was having
an affair with the receptionist. 00:41(Laughter) 00:43And I was still a teenager. So I whisper-shouted back to him, ""Yes, the computer can tell
if you're lying."" 00:51(Laughter) 00:52Well, I laughed, but actually,
the laugh's on me. Nowadays, there are computational systems that can suss out
emotional states and even lying from processing human faces. Advertisers and even governments
are very interested. 01:10I had become a computer programmer because I was one of those kids
crazy about math and science. But somewhere along the line
I'd learned about nuclear weapons, and I'd gotten really concerned
with the ethics of science. I was troubled. However, because of family circumstances, I also needed to start working
as soon as possible. So I thought to myself, hey,
let me pick a technical field where I can get a job easily and where I don't have to deal
with any troublesome questions of ethics. So I picked computers. 01:40(Laughter) 01:41Well, ha, ha, ha!
All the laughs are on me. Nowadays, computer scientists
are building platforms that control what a billion
people see every day. They're developing cars
that could decide who to run over. They're even building machines, weapons, that might kill human beings in war. It's ethics all the way down. 02:07Machine intelligence is here. We're now using computation
to make all sort of decisions, but also new kinds of decisions. We're asking questions to computation
that have no single right answers, that are subjective and open-ended and value-laden. 02:24We're asking questions like, ""Who should the company hire?"" ""Which update from which friend
should you be shown?"" ""Which convict is more
likely to reoffend?"" ""Which news item or movie
should be recommended to people?"" 02:36Look, yes, we've been using
computers for a while, but this is different. This is a historical twist, because we cannot anchor computation
for such subjective decisions the way we can anchor computation
for flying airplanes, building bridges, going to the moon. Are airplanes safer?
Did the bridge sway and fall? There, we have agreed-upon,
fairly clear benchmarks, and we have laws of nature to guide us. We have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs. 03:13To make things more complicated,
our software is getting more powerful, but it's also getting less
transparent and more complex. Recently, in the past decade, complex algorithms
have made great strides. They can recognize human faces. They can decipher handwriting. They can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages. They can detect tumors in medical imaging. They can beat humans in chess and Go. 03:43Much of this progress comes
from a method called ""machine learning."" Machine learning is different
than traditional programming, where you give the computer
detailed, exact, painstaking instructions. It's more like you take the system
and you feed it lots of data, including unstructured data, like the kind we generate
in our digital lives. And the system learns
by churning through this data. And also, crucially, these systems don't operate
under a single-answer logic. They don't produce a simple answer;
it's more probabilistic: ""This one is probably more like
what you're looking for."" 04:20Now, the upside is:
this method is really powerful. The head of Google's AI systems called it, ""the unreasonable effectiveness of data."" The downside is, we don't really understand
what the system learned. In fact, that's its power. This is less like giving
instructions to a computer; it's more like training
a puppy-machine-creature we don't really understand or control. So this is our problem. It's a problem when this artificial
intelligence system gets things wrong. It's also a problem
when it gets things right, because we don't even know which is which
when it's a subjective problem. We don't know what this thing is thinking. 05:03So, consider a hiring algorithm -- a system used to hire people,
using machine-learning systems. Such a system would have been trained
on previous employees' data and instructed to find and hire people like the existing
high performers in the company. Sounds good. I once attended a conference that brought together
human resources managers and executives, high-level people, using such systems in hiring. They were super excited. They thought that this would make hiring
more objective, less biased, and give women
and minorities a better shot against biased human managers. 05:43And look -- human hiring is biased. I know. I mean, in one of my early jobs
as a programmer, my immediate manager would sometimes
come down to where I was really early in the morning
or really late in the afternoon, and she'd say, ""Zeynep,
let's go to lunch!"" I'd be puzzled by the weird timing. It's 4pm. Lunch? I was broke, so free lunch. I always went. I later realized what was happening. My immediate managers
had not confessed to their higher-ups that the programmer they hired
for a serious job was a teen girl who wore jeans and sneakers to work. I was doing a good job,
I just looked wrong and was the wrong age and gender. 06:29So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way certainly sounds good to me. But with these systems,
it is more complicated, and here's why: Currently, computational systems
can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs, even if you have not
disclosed those things. They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings. They have predictive power
with high levels of accuracy. Remember -- for things
you haven't even disclosed. This is inference. 07:05I have a friend who developed
such computational systems to predict the likelihood
of clinical or postpartum depression from social media data. The results are impressive. Her system can predict
the likelihood of depression months before the onset of any symptoms -- months before. No symptoms, there's prediction. She hopes it will be used
for early intervention. Great! But now put this in the context of hiring. 07:36So at this human resources
managers conference, I approached a high-level manager
in a very large company, and I said to her, ""Look,
what if, unbeknownst to you, your system is weeding out people
with high future likelihood of depression? They're not depressed now,
just maybe in the future, more likely. What if it's weeding out women
more likely to be pregnant in the next year or two
but aren't pregnant now? What if it's hiring aggressive people
because that's your workplace culture?"" You can't tell this by looking
at gender breakdowns. Those may be balanced. And since this is machine learning,
not traditional coding, there is no variable there
labeled ""higher risk of depression,"" ""higher risk of pregnancy,"" ""aggressive guy scale."" Not only do you not know
what your system is selecting on, you don't even know
where to begin to look. It's a black box. It has predictive power,
but you don't understand it. 08:40""What safeguards,"" I asked, ""do you have to make sure that your black box
isn't doing something shady?"" She looked at me as if I had
just stepped on 10 puppy tails. 08:52(Laughter) 08:54She stared at me and she said, ""I don't want to hear
another word about this."" And she turned around and walked away. Mind you -- she wasn't rude. It was clearly: what I don't know
isn't my problem, go away, death stare. 09:11(Laughter) 09:13Look, such a system
may even be less biased than human managers in some ways. And it could make monetary sense. But it could also lead to a steady but stealthy
shutting out of the job market of people with higher risk of depression. Is this the kind of society
we want to build, without even knowing we've done this, because we turned decision-making
to machines we don't totally understand? 09:41Another problem is this: these systems are often trained
on data generated by our actions, human imprints. Well, they could just be
reflecting our biases, and these systems
could be picking up on our biases and amplifying them and showing them back to us, while we're telling ourselves, ""We're just doing objective,
neutral computation."" 10:06Researchers found that on Google, women are less likely than men
to be shown job ads for high-paying jobs. And searching for African-American names is more likely to bring up ads
suggesting criminal history, even when there is none. Such hidden biases
and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes
but sometimes we don't know, can have life-altering consequences. 10:37In Wisconsin, a defendant
was sentenced to six years in prison for evading the police. You may not know this, but algorithms are increasingly used
in parole and sentencing decisions. He wanted to know:
How is this score calculated? It's a commercial black box. The company refused to have its algorithm
be challenged in open court. But ProPublica, an investigative
nonprofit, audited that very algorithm with what public data they could find, and found that its outcomes were biased and its predictive power
was dismal, barely better than chance, and it was wrongly labeling
black defendants as future criminals at twice the rate of white defendants. 11:23So, consider this case: This woman was late
picking up her godsister from a school in Broward County, Florida, running down the street
with a friend of hers. They spotted an unlocked kid's bike
and a scooter on a porch and foolishly jumped on it. As they were speeding off,
a woman came out and said, ""Hey! That's my kid's bike!"" They dropped it, they walked away,
but they were arrested. 11:49She was wrong, she was foolish,
but she was also just 18. She had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors. Meanwhile, that man had been arrested
for shoplifting in Home Depot -- 85 dollars' worth of stuff,
a similar petty crime. But he had two prior
armed robbery convictions. But the algorithm scored her
as high risk, and not him. Two years later, ProPublica found
that she had not reoffended. It was just hard to get a job
for her with her record. He, on the other hand, did reoffend and is now serving an eight-year
prison term for a later crime. Clearly, we need to audit our black boxes and not have them have
this kind of unchecked power. 12:34(Applause) 12:38Audits are great and important,
but they don't solve all our problems. Take Facebook's powerful
news feed algorithm -- you know, the one that ranks everything
and decides what to show you from all the friends and pages you follow. Should you be shown another baby picture? 12:55(Laughter) 12:56A sullen note from an acquaintance? An important but difficult news item? There's no right answer. Facebook optimizes
for engagement on the site: likes, shares, comments. 13:08In August of 2014, protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of an African-American
teenager by a white police officer, under murky circumstances. The news of the protests was all over my algorithmically
unfiltered Twitter feed, but nowhere on my Facebook. Was it my Facebook friends? I disabled Facebook's algorithm, which is hard because Facebook
keeps wanting to make you come under the algorithm's control, and saw that my friends
were talking about it. It's just that the algorithm
wasn't showing it to me. I researched this and found
this was a widespread problem. 13:44The story of Ferguson
wasn't algorithm-friendly. It's not ""likable."" Who's going to click on ""like?"" It's not even easy to comment on. Without likes and comments, the algorithm was likely showing it
to even fewer people, so we didn't get to see this. Instead, that week, Facebook's algorithm highlighted this, which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Worthy cause; dump ice water,
donate to charity, fine. But it was super algorithm-friendly. The machine made this decision for us. A very important
but difficult conversation might have been smothered, had Facebook been the only channel. 14:24Now, finally, these systems
can also be wrong in ways that don't resemble human systems. Do you guys remember Watson,
IBM's machine-intelligence system that wiped the floor
with human contestants on Jeopardy? It was a great player. But then, for Final Jeopardy,
Watson was asked this question: ""Its largest airport is named
for a World War II hero, its second-largest
for a World War II battle."" 14:47(Hums Final Jeopardy music) 14:49Chicago. The two humans got it right. Watson, on the other hand,
answered ""Toronto"" -- for a US city category! The impressive system also made an error that a human would never make,
a second-grader wouldn't make. 15:06Our machine intelligence can fail in ways that don't fit
error patterns of humans, in ways we won't expect
and be prepared for. It'd be lousy not to get a job
one is qualified for, but it would triple suck
if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine. 15:24(Laughter) 15:26In May of 2010, a flash crash on Wall Street
fueled by a feedback loop in Wall Street's ""sell"" algorithm wiped a trillion dollars
of value in 36 minutes. I don't even want to think
what ""error"" means in the context of lethal
autonomous weapons. 15:49So yes, humans have always made biases. Decision makers and gatekeepers, in courts, in news, in war ... they make mistakes;
but that's exactly my point. We cannot escape
these difficult questions. We cannot outsource
our responsibilities to machines. 16:10(Applause) 16:17Artificial intelligence does not give us
a ""Get out of ethics free"" card. 16:22Data scientist Fred Benenson
calls this math-washing. We need the opposite. We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion,
scrutiny and investigation. We need to make sure we have
algorithmic accountability, auditing and meaningful transparency. We need to accept
that bringing math and computation to messy, value-laden human affairs does not bring objectivity; rather, the complexity of human affairs
invades the algorithms. Yes, we can and we should use computation to help us make better decisions. But we have to own up
to our moral responsibility to judgment, and use algorithms within that framework, not as a means to abdicate
and outsource our responsibilities to one another as human to human. 17:13Machine intelligence is here. That means we must hold on ever tighter to human values and human ethics. 17:22Thank you. 17:23(Applause)"

and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around
with other dogs. One of my guiding principles
is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share
and believe and feel, then we're in a great position
to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary
with our own experiences. 01:23So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping
computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images. So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it
what it thought about a trip to Australia. It took a look at the pictures,
and it saw a koala. It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought
it was an interesting-looking creature. Then I shared with it a sequence of images
about a house burning down. It took a look at the images and it said, ""This is an amazing view!
This is spectacular!"" It sent chills down my spine. It saw a horrible, life-changing
and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive. I realized that it recognized
the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something
worth remarking on positively. And part of why it was doing this was because most
of the images I had given it were positive images. That's because people
tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences. When was the last time
you saw a selfie at a funeral? 02:43I realized that,
as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots
in what it could understand. And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases. Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect
human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping. I thought back to the evolution
of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against
a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography
was biased against black faces. And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s. And the same blind spot
continues even today in how well we can recognize
different people's faces in facial recognition technology. I though about the state of the art
in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking
to one dataset and one problem. And that in doing so, we were creating
more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify. 04:05I realized then
that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today
looks in five years, in 10 years. Humans evolve slowly,
with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans
and their environment. In contrast, artificial intelligence
is evolving at an incredibly fast rate. And that means that it really matters that we think about this
carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing
the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today
will mean for tomorrow. 04:46CEOs and scientists have weighed in
on what they think the artificial intelligence technology
of the future will be. Stephen Hawking warns that ""Artificial intelligence
could end mankind."" Elon Musk warns
that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks
that we face as a civilization. Bill Gates has made the point, ""I don't understand
why people aren't more concerned."" But these views -- they're part of the story. The math, the models, the basic building blocks
of artificial intelligence are something that we call access
and all work with. We have open-source tools
for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to. And beyond that,
we can share our experience. We can share our experiences
with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us. We can discuss what we love. We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology
that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time. 05:53If we all focus on opening up
the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general
conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome
that best suits us. We already see and know this
in the technology that we use today. We use smart phones
and digital assistants and Roombas. Are they evil? Maybe sometimes. Are they beneficial? Yes, they're that, too. And they're not all the same. And there you already see
a light shining on what the future holds. The future continues on
from what we build and create right now. We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path. 06:53In our time right now,
we shape the AI of tomorrow. Technology that immerses us
in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds. Technology that helps people
to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating. Technology built on understanding
the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars. Technology built on understanding images
and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people
who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world. And we also see how technology
can lead to problems. We have technology today that analyzes physical
characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin
or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not
we might be criminals or terrorists. We have technology
that crunches through our data, even data relating
to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not
we might get a loan. All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution
of artificial intelligence. Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution. That means that what we do now
will affect what happens down the line and in the future. 08:14If we want AI to evolve
in a way that helps humans, then we need to define
the goals and strategies that enable that path now. What I'd like to see is something
that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment. Technology that aids and assists
those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life
equally challenging for everyone. Technology that works regardless of your demographics
or the color of your skin. And so today, what I focus on
is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now. 08:56AI can turn out in many different ways. But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car
without any destination. This is the car that we are driving. We choose when to speed up
and when to slow down. We choose if we need to make a turn. We choose what the AI
of the future will be. There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial
intelligence can become. It will become many things. And it's up to us now, in order to figure out
what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes
of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be
better for all of us. 09:39Thank you. 09:40(Applause)"
2,How do we learn to work with intelligent machines?,Matt Beane,Feb 2019,"The path to skill around the globe has been the same for thousands of years: train under an expert and take on small, easy tasks before progressing to riskier, harder ones.

her prostate patient into the OR. She's a resident, a surgeon in training. It’s her job to learn. Today, she’s really hoping to do
some of the nerve-sparing, extremely delicate dissection
that can preserve erectile function. That'll be up to the attending surgeon,
though, but he's not there yet. She and the team put the patient under, and she leads the initial eight-inch
incision in the lower abdomen. Once she’s got that clamped back,
she tells the nurse to call the attending. He arrives, gowns up, And from there on in, their four hands
are mostly in that patient -- with him guiding
but Kristin leading the way. When the prostates out (and, yes,
he let Kristen do a little nerve sparing), he rips off his scrubs. He starts to do paperwork. Kristen closes the patient by 8:15, with a junior resident
looking over her shoulder. And she lets him do
the final line of sutures. Kristen feels great. Patient’s going to be fine, and no doubt she’s a better surgeon
than she was at 6:30. 01:22Now this is extreme work. But Kristin’s learning to do her job
the way that most of us do: watching an expert for a bit, getting involved in easy,
safe parts of the work and progressing to riskier
and harder tasks as they guide and decide she’s ready. My whole life I’ve been fascinated
by this kind of learning. It feels elemental,
part of what makes us human. It has different names: apprenticeship,
coaching, mentorship, on the job training. In surgery, it’s called
“see one, do one, teach one.” But the process is the same, and it’s been the main path to skill
around the globe for thousands of years. Right now, we’re handling AI
in a way that blocks that path. We’re sacrificing learning
in our quest for productivity. 02:13I found this first in surgery
while I was at MIT, but now I’ve got evidence
it’s happening all over, in very different industries
and with very different kinds of AI. If we do nothing, millions of us
are going to hit a brick wall as we try to learn to deal with AI. Let’s go back to surgery to see how. 02:35Fast forward six months. It’s 6:30am again, and Kristen
is wheeling another prostate patient in, but this time to the robotic OR. The attending leads attaching a four-armed, thousand-pound
robot to the patient. They both rip off their scrubs, head to control consoles
10 or 15 feet away, and Kristen just watches. The robot allows the attending
to do the whole procedure himself, so he basically does. He knows she needs practice. He wants to give her control. But he also knows she’d be slower
and make more mistakes, and his patient comes first. So Kristin has no hope of getting anywhere
near those nerves during this rotation. She’ll be lucky if she operates more than
15 minutes during a four-hour procedure. And she knows that when she slips up, he’ll tap a touch screen,
and she’ll be watching again, feeling like a kid in the corner
with a dunce cap. 03:41Like all the studies of robots and work
I’ve done in the last eight years, I started this one
with a big, open question: How do we learn to work
with intelligent machines? To find out, I spent two and a half years
observing dozens of residents and surgeons doing traditional and robotic surgery,
interviewing them and in general hanging out
with the residents as they tried to learn. I covered 18 of the top
US teaching hospitals, and the story was the same. Most residents were in Kristen's shoes. They got to “see one” plenty, but the “do one” was barely available. So they couldn’t struggle,
and they weren’t learning. 04:21This was important news for surgeons, but
I needed to know how widespread it was: Where else was using AI
blocking learning on the job? To find out, I’ve connected with a small
but growing group of young researchers who’ve done boots-on-the-ground studies
of work involving AI in very diverse settings
like start-ups, policing, investment banking and online education. Like me, they spent at least a year
and many hundreds of hours observing, interviewing and often working
side-by-side with the people they studied. We shared data, and I looked for patterns. No matter the industry, the work,
the AI, the story was the same. Organizations were trying harder
and harder to get results from AI, and they were peeling learners away from
expert work as they did it. Start-up managers were outsourcing
their customer contact. Cops had to learn to deal with crime
forecasts without experts support. Junior bankers were getting
cut out of complex analysis, and professors had to build
online courses without help. And the effect of all of this
was the same as in surgery. Learning on the job
was getting much harder. 05:36This can’t last. McKinsey estimates that between half
a billion and a billion of us are going to have to adapt to AI
in our daily work by 2030. And we’re assuming
that on-the-job learning will be there for us as we try. Accenture’s latest workers survey showed
that most workers learned key skills on the job, not in formal training. So while we talk a lot about its
potential future impact, the aspect of AI
that may matter most right now is that we’re handling it in a way
that blocks learning on the job just when we need it most. 06:15Now across all our sites,
a small minority found a way to learn. They did it by breaking and bending rules. Approved methods weren’t working,
so they bent and broke rules to get hands-on practice with experts. In my setting, residents got involved
in robotic surgery in medical school at the expense
of their generalist education. And they spent hundreds of extra hours
with simulators and recordings of surgery, when you were supposed to learn in the OR. And maybe most importantly,
they found ways to struggle in live procedures
with limited expert supervision. I call all this “shadow learning,”
because it bends the rules and learner’s do it out of the limelight. And everyone turns a blind eye
because it gets results. Remember, these are
the star pupils of the bunch. 07:17Now, obviously, this is not OK,
and it’s not sustainable. No one should have to risk getting fired to learn the skills
they need to do their job. But we do need to learn from these people. They took serious risks to learn. They understood they needed to protect
struggle and challenge in their work so that they could push themselves
to tackle hard problems right near the edge of their capacity. They also made sure
there was an expert nearby to offer pointers and to backstop
against catastrophe. Let’s build this combination
of struggle and expert support into each AI implementation. 07:56Here’s one clear example
I could get of this on the ground. Before robots, if you were a bomb disposal technician,
you dealt with an IED by walking up to it. A junior officer was
hundreds of feet away, so could only watch and help
if you decided it was safe and invited them downrange. Now you sit side-by-side
in a bomb-proof truck. You both watched the video feed. They control a distant robot,
and you guide the work out loud. Trainees learn better than they
did before robots. We can scale this to surgery,
start-ups, policing, investment banking,
online education and beyond. The good news is
we’ve got new tools to do it. The internet and the cloud mean we don’t
always need one expert for every trainee, for them to be physically near each other
or even to be in the same organization. And we can build AI to help: to coach learners as they struggle,
to coach experts as they coach and to connect those two groups
in smart ways. 09:03There are people at work
on systems like this, but they’ve been mostly focused
on formal training. And the deeper crisis
is in on-the-job learning. We must do better. Today’s problems demand we do better to create work that takes full advantage
of AI’s amazing capabilities while enhancing our skills as we do it. That’s the kind of future
I dreamed of as a kid. And the time to create it is now. 09:32Thank you. 09:33(Applause)"
2,The value of your humanity in an automated future,Kevin Roose,Feb 2021,"To futureproof your job against robots and AI, you should learn how to code, brush up on your math skills and crack open an engineering textbook, right? Wrong. In this surprisingly comforting talk, tech journalist Kevin Roose makes the case that rather than trying to compete with the machines, we should instead focus on what makes us uniquely human.", (41K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)Joseph Geni, TranslatorCamille Martínez, Reviewer00:01I was in my mid-20s
the first time I realized that I could be replaced by a robot. At the time, I was working
as a financial reporter covering Wall Street and the stock market, and one day, I heard about
this new AI reporting app. Basically, you just feed in some data, like a corporate financial report
or a database of real estate listings, and the app would automatically
strip out all the important parts, plug it into a news story and publish it, with no human input required. 00:28Now, these AI reporting apps, they weren't going to win
any Pulitzer Prizes, but they were shockingly effective. Major news organizations
were already starting to use them, and one company said
that its AI reporting app had been used to write
300 million news stories in a single year, which is slightly more than me and probably more than
every human journalist on earth combined. 00:54For the last few years, I've been researching this coming wave
of AI and automation, and I've learned that
what happened to me that day is happening to workers
in all kinds of industries, no matter how seemingly prestigious
or high-paid their jobs are. Doctors are learning
that machine learning algorithms can now diagnose certain types of cancers
more accurately than they can. Lawyers are going up against legal AIs
that can spot issues in contracts with better precision than them. Recently at Google, they ran an experiment
with an AI that trains neural networks -- essentially, a robot
that makes other robots. And they found that
these AI-trained neural networks were more accurate than the ones that
their own human programmers had coded. 01:40But the most disturbing thing
I learned in my research is that we've been preparing
for this automated future in exactly the wrong way. For years, the conventional wisdom
has been that if technology is the future, then we need to get as close
to the technology as possible. We told people to learn to code
and to study hard skills like data science, engineering and math, because all those soft skills people, those artists and writers
and philosophers, they were just going to end up
serving coffee to our robot overlords. 02:15But what I learned was that essentially
the opposite is true. Rather than trying
to compete with machines, we should be trying to improve
our human skills, the kinds of things
that only people can do, things involving compassion
and critical thinking and moral courage. And when we do our jobs, we should be trying to do them
as humanely as possible. For me, that meant putting
more of myself in my work. I stopped writing formulaic
corporate earnings stories, and I started writing things
that revealed more of my personality. I started a financial poetry series. I wrote profiles of quirky
and interesting people on Wall Street like the barber who cuts
people's hair at Goldman Sachs. I even convinced my editor to let me
live like a billionaire for a day, wearing a 30,000 dollar watch
and driving around in a Rolls Royce, flying in a private jet. Tough job, but someone's got to do it. 03:15And I found that this new
human approach to my job made me feel much more optimistic
about my own future, because you can teach a robot
to summarize the news or to write a headline
that's going to get a lot of clicks from Google or Facebook, but you can't automate
making someone laugh with a dumb limerick about the bond market or explaining what a collateralized
debt obligation is to them without making them fall asleep. And as I researched more, I found so many more examples
of people who had succeeded this way by refusing to compete with machines and instead making themselves more human. 03:53Take Rus. Rus Garofalo is my accountant. He helps me with my taxes every year, and as you can probably
tell from the photo, Rus is not a traditional accountant. He's a former standup comedian, and he brings his comedic
sensibility to his work. I swear, I've had more fun talking about
itemized deductions with Rus than at actual comedy shows
that I've paid real money to see. Rus knows that in the age of TurboTax, the only way for human
accountants to stay relevant is bringing something to the table
other than tax expertise. So he started a company
called Brass Taxes. Get it? He hired a bunch of other funny
and personable accountants, and he started looking for clients
in creative industries who would appreciate the value
of having a human being walk them through their taxes. 04:43Now, technically, I should be
very worried about Rus, because tax preparation
is a highly automation-prone industry. In fact, according to
an Oxford University study, it has a 99 percent chance
of being automated. But I'm not worried about Rus, because he's figured out a way
to turn tax preparation from a chore into an entertaining human experience that lots of people, including me, are willing to pay for. 05:13Or take Mitsuru Kawai. Sixty years ago, Mitsuru started
as a junior trainee at a Toyota factory in Japan. He made car parts by hand. And this was the 1960s, an era where the auto industry
was undergoing a huge technological transformation. The first factory robots had started
coming onto the assembly lines, and a lot of people were worried that auto workers were
going to become obsolete. Mitsuru decided to focus on what,
in Japanese, is called ""monozukuri"" -- basically, human craftsmanship. He studied all the nuanced,
intricate details of auto design, and he developed these
kind of sixth-sense skills that few of his other colleagues had. He could listen to a machine
and tell when it was about to break or look at a piece of metal
and figure out what temperature it was just by what shade
of orange it was glowing. Eventually, Mitsuru's bosses noticed
that he had all these skills that his coworkers didn't, and they made him really valuable, because he could work alongside the robots
filling in the gaps, doing the things that they couldn't do. He kept getting promoted and promoted, and just this year, Mitsuru Kawai was named Toyota's
first-ever Chief Monozukuri Officer, in recognition of the 60 years
that he spent teaching Toyota workers that even in a highly automated industry, their human skills still matter. 06:39Or take Marcus Books. Marcus Books is a small,
independent, Black-owned bookstore in my hometown of Oakland, California. It's a pretty amazing place. It's the oldest Black-owned
bookstore in America, and for 60 years, it's been introducing Oaklanders to the work of people
like Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou. But the most amazing
thing about Marcus Books is that it's still here. So many independent bookstores
have gone out of business in the last few decades because of Amazon or the internet. 07:10So how did Marcus Books do it? Well, it's not because they have
the lowest prices or the slickest e-commerce setup
or the most optimized supply chain. It's because Marcus Books
is so much more than a bookstore. It's a community gathering place, where generations of Oaklanders
have gone to learn and grow. It's a safe place where Black customers know that
they're not going to be followed around or patted down by a security guard. As Blanche Richardson, one of the owners
of Marcus Books, told me, ""It just has good vibes."" 07:47Earlier this year, Marcus Books
temporarily closed, and like a lot of businesses,
its future was uncertain. It was raising money
through a GoFundMe page. And then George Floyd was killed. The streets filled with protests, and orders poured in to Marcus Books
from all over the country -- first, a hundred books a day, then 200, then 300. Today, they're selling
five times as many books as they were before the pandemic, and their GoFundMe page
has raised more than 250,000 dollars. And if you look at the comments
on its GoFundMe page, you can see why Marcus Books
has survived all these years. One person wrote that we have
a duty to preserve gems like this in our community. Someone else said, ""I've been going to Marcus Books
since I was a child, and Blanche Richardson
showed me many kindnesses."" ""Gems."" ""Kindnesses."" Those aren't words about technology. They're not even words about books. They're words about people. The thing that saved Marcus Books was how they made their customers feel: an experience, not a transaction. 09:11If you, like me, sometimes worry about your own place
in an automated future, you have a few options. You can try to compete with the machines. You can work long hours, you can turn yourself into a sleek,
efficient productivity machine. Or you can focus on your humanity and doing the things
that machines can't do, bringing all those human skills to bear on whatever your work is. If you're a doctor, you can work
on your bedside manner so that your patients
come to see you as their friend rather than just their medical provider. If you're a lawyer, you can work
on your trial skills and your client interactions rather than just cranking out
briefs and contracts all day. If you're a programmer, you can spend time with the people
who actually use your products, figure out what their problems are
and try to solve them, rather than just hitting
next quarter's growth targets. 10:03That's how we become futureproof. Not by taking on the machines, but by excelling in the areas
where humans have a natural advantage. By living and working more like humans, we can make ourselves
impossible to replace. And the good news is that we don't
have to learn a single line of code or deploy a single algorithm. In fact, you already have
everything you need. 10:34Thank you."

of people are unemployed or underemployed, there's a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing to the labor force. And as I look at the conversation, it strikes me that it's focused
on exactly the right topic, and at the same time,
it's missing the point entirely. The topic that it's focused on, the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting people's ability to earn a living, or, to say it a little bit different way, are the droids taking our jobs? And there's some evidence that they are. 00:32The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed its kind of slow, steady march upward, and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound, and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly. Corporate profits are quite high; in fact, if you include bank profits, they're higher than they've ever been. And business investment
in gear -- in equipment and hardware and software --
is at an all-time high. So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks. What they're not really doing is hiring. So this red line is the employment-to-population ratio, in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America who have work. And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession, and it hasn't started
to bounce back at all. 01:18But the story is not
just a recession story. The decade that we've
just been through had relatively anemic job growth
all throughout, especially when we compare it
to other decades, and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade than at the beginning. This is not what you want to see. When you graph the number
of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country, you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time, and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way. 01:52I did some quick calculations. I took the last 20 years of GDP growth and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth and used those in a fairly
straightforward way to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need to keep growing, and this is the line that I came up with. Is that good or bad? This is the government's projection for the working-age
population going forward. So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close. 02:21The problem is, I don't think
these projections are accurate. In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic, because when I did it, I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past, with labor productivity growth, and that's actually not what I believe. Because when I look around, I think that we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology's
impact on the labor force. 02:44Just in the past couple years,
we've seen digital tools display skills and abilities
that they never, ever had before, and that kind of eat deeply
into what we human beings do for a living. Let me give you a couple examples. 02:59Throughout all of history, if you wanted something translated
from one language into another, you had to involve a human being. Now we have multi-language, instantaneous, automatic translation services
available for free via many of our devices,
all the way down to smartphones. And if any of us have used these, we know that they're not perfect,
but they're decent. 03:23Throughout all of history,
if you wanted something written, a report or an article,
you had to involve a person. Not anymore. This is an article that appeared
in Forbes online a while back, about Apple's earnings. It was written by an algorithm. And it's not decent -- it's perfect. 03:41A lot of people look at this and they say, ""OK, but those are very
specific, narrow tasks, and most knowledge workers
are actually generalists. And what they do is sit on top of a very
large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly
to kind of unpredictable demands, and that's very, very hard to automate."" One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory is a guy named Ken Jennings. He won the quiz show
""Jeopardy!"" 74 times in a row. Took home three million dollars. That's Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM. So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers, I start to think there might not be
something so special about this idea of a generalist, particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson, and having technologies
that can understand what we're saying and repeat speech back to us. 04:38Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws, but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore's law trajectory, which they will, in six years, they're not going to be two
times better or four times better, they'll be 16 times better
than they are right now. So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this. 05:02And digital technologies are not
just impacting knowledge work, they're starting to flex their muscles
in the physical world as well. I had the chance a little while back
to ride in the Google autonomous car, which is as cool as it sounds. 05:15(Laughter) 05:17And I will vouch that it handled
the stop-and-go traffic on US 101 very smoothly. There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living in the United States; I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology. And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive. They can't do very much. But they're getting better quite quickly and DARPA, which is the investment arm
of the Defense Department, is trying to accelerate their trajectory. 05:44So, in short, yeah, the droids
are coming for our jobs. In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure, because the robots today
still aren't very good at fixing bridges. But in the not-too-long-term, I think within the lifetimes
of most of the people in this room, we're going to transition into an economy
that is very productive, but that just doesn't need
a lot of human workers. And managing that transition
is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces. Voltaire summarized why; he said, ""Work saves us from three great evils:
boredom, vice and need."" 06:25But despite this challenge -- personally, I'm still
a huge digital optimist, and I am supremely confident that the digital technologies
that we're developing now are going to take us
into a Utopian future, not a dystopian future. And to explain why, I want to pose a ridiculously
broad question. I want to ask: what have been the most important
developments in human history? 06:47Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I've gotten in response to this question. It's a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about, because some people are going to bring up systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world. And then other people will say, ""No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments are the founding
of the world's major religions, which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced how countless people
are living their lives."" And then some other folk will say, ""Actually, what changes civilizations, what modifies them and what changes
people's lives are empires, so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war."" And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says, ""Hey, don't forget about plagues!"" 07:35(Laughter) 07:39There are some optimistic
answers to this question, so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration and the opening up of the world. Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get
a better handle on the world, and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences. So this debate will go on and on. It's an endless debate and there's no conclusive,
single answer to it. But if you're a geek like me, you say, ""Well, what do the data say?"" And you start to do things like graph things
that we might be interested in -- the total worldwide
population, for example, or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society. And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach, the big stories, the big
developments in human history, are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot. 08:28So when you do this
and when you plot the data, you pretty quickly come
to some weird conclusions. You conclude, actually, that none of these things
have mattered very much. 08:37(Laughter) 08:41They haven't done
a darn thing to the curves. There has been one story,
one development in human history that bent the curve,
bent it just about 90 degrees, and it is a technology story. 08:55The steam engine and the other
associated technologies of the Industrial Revolution changed the world and influenced
human history so much, that in the words
of the historian Ian Morris, ""... they made mockery out of all
that had come before."" And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles, overcoming the limitations of our muscles. Now, what we're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying
our mental power. How can this not be as big a deal as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles? 09:30So at the risk of repeating
myself a little bit, when I look at what's going on
with digital technology these days, we are not anywhere near
through with this journey. And when I look at what is happening
to our economies and our societies, my single conclusion is that
we ain't seen nothing yet. The best days are really ahead. 09:48Let me give you a couple examples. Economies don't run on energy. They don't run on capital,
they don't run on labor. Economies run on ideas. So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas, is some of the most powerful, most
fundamental work that we can do in an economy. And this is kind of how
we used to do innovation. We'd find a bunch of fairly
similar-looking people ... 10:13(Laughter) 10:16We'd take them out of elite institutions, we'd put them into other
elite institutions and we'd wait for the innovation. Now -- 10:23(Laughter) 10:26as a white guy who spent
his whole career at MIT and Harvard, I've got no problem with this. 10:31(Laughter) 10:35But some other people do, and they've kind of crashed the party and loosened up
the dress code of innovation. 10:40(Laughter) 10:41So here are the winners of a Topcoder
programming challenge, and I assure you that nobody cares where these kids grew up,
where they went to school, or what they look like. All anyone cares about is the quality
of the work, the quality of the ideas. 10:56And over and over again,
we see this happening in the technology-facilitated world. The work of innovation
is becoming more open, more inclusive, more transparent
and more merit-based, and that's going to continue no matter
what MIT and Harvard think of it, and I couldn't be happier
about that development. 11:14I hear once in a while,
""OK, I'll grant you that, but technology is still a tool
for the rich world, and what's not happening, these digital tools are not
improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid."" And I want to say to that
very clearly: nonsense. The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology. The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back where he watched, in great detail, what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India, when they got mobile phones
for the very first time. And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics, you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language. But when I read his paper, I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us and say, ""Look, this was a big deal. Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives. Waste was not reduced --
it was eliminated. And the lives of both
the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved."" 12:08Now, what I don't think
is that Jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land
in the one set of villages where technology made things better. What happened instead
is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again
when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community: the lives of people, the welfares
of people, improve dramatically. 12:29So as I look around at all the evidence and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us, I become a huge digital optimist and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson is actually not hyperbole. This is an accurate assessment
of what's going on. Our technologies are great gifts, and we, right now,
have the great good fortune to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing, when it is broadening and deepening
and becoming more profound all around the world. 12:59So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs, but focusing on that fact
misses the point entirely. The point is that then we
are freed up to do other things, and what we're going to do,
I am very confident, what we're going to do is reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world. I'm very confident we're going to learn
to live more lightly on the planet, and I am extremely confident
that what we're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound
and so beneficial that it's going to make a mockery
out of everything that came before. I'm going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front-row seat
for digital progress, our old friend Ken Jennings. I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words: ""I, for one, welcome our new
computer overlords."" 13:43(Laughter) 13:44Thanks very much. 13:46(Applause)"
2,A fascinating time capsule of human feelings toward AI,Lucy Farey-Jones,Mar 2020,How comfortable are you with robots taking over your life? Covering a wide range of potential applications -- from the mundane (robot house cleaner) to the mischievous (robot sex partner) to the downright macabre (uploading your brain to live on after death) -- technology strategist Lucy Farey-Jones shares data-backed evidence of how our willingness to accept AI may be radically changing., (59K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I'm here, because I've spent
far too many nights lying awake, worrying and wondering
who wins in the end. Is it humans or is it robots? 00:10You see, as a technology strategist, my job involves behavior change: understanding why and how
people adopt new technologies. And that means I'm really frustrated that I know I won't live to see
how this all ends up. And in fact, if the youngest person
watching this is 14 and the oldest, a robust 99, then together, our collective consciousnesses
span just 185 years. That is a myopic pinprick of time when you think of the evolution
and the story of life on this planet. Turns out we're all in the cheap seats and none of us will live to see
how it all pans out. 00:48footnotefootnoteSo at my company,
we wanted a way around this. We wanted to see if there was
a way to cantilever out, beyond our fixed temporal vantage point, to get a sense of how it all shakes up. And to do this, we conducted a study
amongst 1,200 Americans representative of the US census, in which we asked a battery
of attitudinal questions around robotics and AI and also captured behavioral ones
around technology adoption. 01:14We had a big study so that we could analyze
differences in gender and generations, between religious and political beliefs, even job function and personality trait. It is a fascinating,
time-bound time capsule of our human frailty in this predawn of the robotic era. And I have five minutes
to tell you about it. 01:34The first thing you should know
is that we brainstormed a list of scenarios
of current and potential AI robotics. They ran the spectrum from the mundane, so, a robot house cleaner, anyone? Through to the mischievous, the idea of a robot pet sitter,
or maybe a robot lawyer, or maybe a sex partner. Through to the downright macabre,
the idea of being a cyborg, blending human and robot, or uploading your brain
so it could live on after your death. And we plotted people's comfort levels
with these various scenarios. There were actually 31 in the study, but for ease, I'm going to show you
just a few of them here. 02:12The first thing you'll notice,
of course, is the sea of red. America is very uncomfortable
with this stuff. That's why we call it
the discomfort index, not the comfort index. There were only two things
the majority of America is OK with. And that's the idea
of a robot AI house cleaner and a robot AI package deliverer, so Dyson and Amazon, you guys should talk. There's an opportunity there. 02:36It seems we're ready to off-load
our chores to our robot friends. We're kind of definitely on the fence
when it comes to services, so robot AI lawyer
or a financial adviser, maybe. But we're firmly closed
to the idea of robot care, whether it be a nurse,
a doctor, child care. So from this, you'd go, ""It's OK, Lucy, you know what? Go back to sleep, stop worrying,
the humans win in the end."" But actually not so fast. 02:59If you look at my data very closely, you can see we're more
vulnerable than we think. AI has a branding problem. So of those folks who said that they would absolutely reject
the idea of a personal assistant, 45 percent of them had, in fact,
one in their pockets, in terms of a device
with Alexa, Google or Siri. One in five of those who were against
the idea of AI matchmaking had of course, you guessed it,
done online dating. And 80 percent of those of us
who refuse the idea of boarding an autonomous plane
with a pilot backup had in fact, just like me
to get here to Vancouver, flown commercial. 03:31Lest you think everybody
was scared, though, here are the marvelous folk in the middle. These are the neutrals. These are people for whom you say, ""OK, robot friend,"" and they're like,
""Hm, robot friend. Maybe."" Or, ""AI pet,"" and they go, ""Never say never."" And as any decent
political operative knows, flipping the ambivalent middle
can change the game. 03:52Another reason I know
we're vulnerable is men -- I'm sorry, but men,
you are twice as likely than women to believe that getting
into an autonomous car is a good idea, that uploading your brain
for posterity is fun, and two and a half times more likely
to believe that becoming a cyborg is cool, and for this, I blame Hollywood. 04:09(Laughter) 04:10And this is where I want you
to look around the theater and know that one in four men
are OK with the idea of sex with a robot. That goes up to 44 percent
of millennial men compared to just one in 10 women, which I think puts a whole new twist
on the complaint of mechanical sex. 04:24(Laughter) 04:26Even more astounding
than that though, to be honest, is this behavioral difference. So here we have people who have
a device with a voice assistant in it, so a smart speaker,
a home hub or a smart phone, versus those who don't. And you can see from this graph that the Trojan horse
is already in our living room. And as these devices proliferate and our collective defenses soften, we all see how it can end. In fact, this may be as good
a time as any to admit I did take my Alexa Dot
on vacation with me. 04:58footnotefootnoteFinal finding I have time for
is generational. So look at the difference
just three generations make. This is the leap from silent
to boomer to millennial. And what's more fascinating than this
is if you extrapolate this out, the same rate of change, just the same pace, not the accelerated one
I actually believe will be the case, the same pace, then it is eight generations away when we hear every single American thinking the majority
of these things here are normal. So the year 2222 is an astounding place where everything here is mainstream. 05:28footnotefootnoteAnd lest you needed any more convincing, here is the generation's
""excitement level with AI."" So not surprisingly,
the youngest of us are more excited. But, and possibly the most
paradoxical finding of my career, when I asked these people my 3am question, ""Who wins in the end?"" Guess what. The more excited you are
about AI and robotics, the more likely you are to say
it's the robots. And I don't think we need a neural net
running pattern-recognition software to see where this is all headed. We are the proverbial frogs
in boiling water. So if the robots at TED2222
are watching this for posterity, could you send a cyborg, dig me up
and tell me if I was right? 06:09(Laughter) 06:10Thank you. 06:11(Applause)"

philosophers and computer scientists, and we sit around and think about
the future of machine intelligence, among other things. Some people think that some of these
things are sort of science fiction-y, far out there, crazy. But I like to say, okay, let's look at the modern
human condition. (Laughter) This is the normal way for things to be. 00:29But if we think about it, we are actually recently arrived
guests on this planet, the human species. Think about if Earth
was created one year ago, the human species, then, 
would be 10 minutes old. The industrial era started
two seconds ago. Another way to look at this is to think of
world GDP over the last 10,000 years, I've actually taken the trouble
to plot this for you in a graph.
 It looks like this. (Laughter) It's a curious shape
for a normal condition. I sure wouldn't want to sit on it. (Laughter) 01:07Let's ask ourselves, what is the cause
of this current anomaly? Some people would say it's technology. Now it's true, technology has accumulated
through human history, and right now, technology
advances extremely rapidly -- that is the proximate cause, that's why we are currently 
so very productive. But I like to think back further 
to the ultimate cause. 01:33Look at these two highly
distinguished gentlemen: We have Kanzi -- he's mastered 200 lexical
tokens, an incredible feat. And Ed Witten unleashed the second
superstring revolution. If we look under the hood, 
this is what we find: basically the same thing. One is a little larger, it maybe also has a few tricks
in the exact way it's wired. These invisible differences cannot
be too complicated, however, because there have only
been 250,000 generations since our last common ancestor. We know that complicated mechanisms
take a long time to evolve. So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten, from broken-off tree branches
to intercontinental ballistic missiles. 02:20So this then seems pretty obvious
that everything we've achieved, and everything we care about, depends crucially on some relatively minor
changes that made the human mind. And the corollary, of course,
is that any further changes that could significantly change
the substrate of thinking could have potentially 
enormous consequences. 02:44Some of my colleagues 
think we're on the verge of something that could cause
a profound change in that substrate, and that is machine superintelligence. Artificial intelligence used to be
about putting commands in a box. You would have human programmers that would painstakingly 
handcraft knowledge items. You build up these expert systems, and they were kind of useful 
for some purposes, but they were very brittle,
you couldn't scale them. Basically, you got out only
what you put in. But since then, a paradigm shift has taken place
in the field of artificial intelligence. 03:18Today, the action is really 
around machine learning. So rather than handcrafting knowledge
representations and features, we create algorithms that learn,
often from raw perceptual data. Basically the same thing
that the human infant does. The result is A.I. that is not
limited to one domain -- the same system can learn to translate 
between any pairs of languages, or learn to play any computer game
on the Atari console. Now of course, A.I. is still nowhere near having
the same powerful, cross-domain ability to learn and plan
as a human being has. The cortex still has some 
algorithmic tricks that we don't yet know
how to match in machines. 04:07So the question is, how far are we from being able
to match those tricks? A couple of years ago, we did a survey of some of the world's 
leading A.I. experts, to see what they think,
and one of the questions we asked was, ""By which year do you think
there is a 50 percent probability that we will have achieved 
human-level machine intelligence?"" We defined human-level here 
as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well
as an adult human, so real human-level, not just
within some limited domain. And the median answer was 2040 or 2050, depending on precisely which 
group of experts we asked. Now, it could happen much,
much later, or sooner, the truth is nobody really knows. 04:53What we do know is that the ultimate 
limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside 
the limits in biological tissue. This comes down to physics. A biological neuron fires, maybe, 
at 200 hertz, 200 times a second. But even a present-day transistor
operates at the Gigahertz. Neurons propagate slowly in axons,
100 meters per second, tops. But in computers, signals can travel
at the speed of light. There are also size limitations, like a human brain has 
to fit inside a cranium, but a computer can be the size
of a warehouse or larger. So the potential for superintelligence 
lies dormant in matter, much like the power of the atom 
lay dormant throughout human history, patiently waiting there until 1945. In this century, scientists may learn to awaken
the power of artificial intelligence. And I think we might then see
an intelligence explosion. 05:58Now most people, when they think
about what is smart and what is dumb, I think have in mind a picture
roughly like this. So at one end we have the village idiot, and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten, or Albert Einstein,
or whoever your favorite guru is. But I think that from the point of view
of artificial intelligence, the true picture is actually
probably more like this: AI starts out at this point here,
at zero intelligence, and then, after many, many 
years of really hard work, maybe eventually we get to
mouse-level artificial intelligence, something that can navigate 
cluttered environments as well as a mouse can. And then, after many, many more years
of really hard work, lots of investment, maybe eventually we get to
chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence. And then, after even more years 
of really, really hard work, we get to village idiot 
artificial intelligence. And a few moments later, 
we are beyond Ed Witten. The train doesn't stop
at Humanville Station. It's likely, rather, to swoosh right by. 07:02Now this has profound implications, particularly when it comes 
to questions of power. For example, chimpanzees are strong -- pound for pound, a chimpanzee is about
twice as strong as a fit human male. And yet, the fate of Kanzi 
and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on
what the chimpanzees do themselves. Once there is superintelligence, the fate of humanity may depend
on what the superintelligence does. Think about it: Machine intelligence is the last invention
that humanity will ever need to make. Machines will then be better 
at inventing than we are, and they'll be doing so 
on digital timescales. What this means is basically
a telescoping of the future. Think of all the crazy technologies 
that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed
in the fullness of time: cures for aging, space colonization, self-replicating nanobots or uploading
of minds into computers, all kinds of science fiction-y stuff that's nevertheless consistent 
with the laws of physics. All of this superintelligence could 
develop, and possibly quite rapidly. 08:12Now, a superintelligence with such 
technological maturity would be extremely powerful, and at least in some scenarios,
it would be able to get what it wants. We would then have a future that would
be shaped by the preferences of this A.I. Now a good question is,
what are those preferences? Here it gets trickier. To make any headway with this, we must first of all
avoid anthropomorphizing. And this is ironic because 
every newspaper article about the future of A.I.
has a picture of this: So I think what we need to do is
to conceive of the issue more abstractly, not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios. 08:57We need to think of intelligence 
as an optimization process, a process that steers the future
into a particular set of configurations. A superintelligence is
a really strong optimization process. It's extremely good at using 
available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized. This means that there is no necessary
connection between being highly intelligent in this sense, and having an objective that we humans
would find worthwhile or meaningful. 09:27Suppose we give an A.I. the goal 
to make humans smile. When the A.I. is weak, it performs useful
or amusing actions that cause its user to smile. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent, it realizes that there is a more
effective way to achieve this goal: take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial
muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins. Another example, suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve
a difficult mathematical problem. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent, it realizes that the most effective way 
to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet
into a giant computer, so as to increase its thinking capacity. And notice that this gives the A.I.s
an instrumental reason to do things to us that we
might not approve of. Human beings in this model are threats, we could prevent the mathematical
problem from being solved. 10:17Of course, perceivably things won't 
go wrong in these particular ways; these are cartoon examples. But the general point here is important: if you create a really powerful
optimization process to maximize for objective x, you better make sure 
that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about. This is a lesson that's also taught
in many a myth. King Midas wishes that everything
he touches be turned into gold. He touches his daughter, 
she turns into gold. He touches his food, it turns into gold. This could become practically relevant, not just as a metaphor for greed, but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful
optimization process and give it misconceived 
or poorly specified goals. 11:04Now you might say, if a computer starts
sticking electrodes into people's faces, we'd just shut it off. A, this is not necessarily so easy to do
if we've grown dependent on the system -- like, where is the off switch 
to the Internet? B, why haven't the chimpanzees
flicked the off switch to humanity, or the Neanderthals? They certainly had reasons. We have an off switch, 
for example, right here. (Choking) The reason is that we are 
an intelligent adversary; we can anticipate threats 
and plan around them. But so could a superintelligent agent, and it would be much better 
at that than we are. The point is, we should not be confident
that we have this under control here. 11:52And we could try to make our job
a little bit easier by, say, putting the A.I. in a box, like a secure software environment, a virtual reality simulation
from which it cannot escape. But how confident can we be that
the A.I. couldn't find a bug. Given that merely human hackers
find bugs all the time, I'd say, probably not very confident. So we disconnect the ethernet cable
to create an air gap, but again, like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps
using social engineering. Right now, as I speak, I'm sure there is some employee
out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out 
her account details by somebody claiming to be
from the I.T. department. 12:34More creative scenarios are also possible, like if you're the A.I., you can imagine wiggling electrodes
around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you
can use to communicate. Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction, and then when the programmers open
you up to see what went wrong with you, they look at the source code -- Bam! -- the manipulation can take place. Or it could output the blueprint
to a really nifty technology, and when we implement it, it has some surreptitious side effect
that the A.I. had planned. The point here is that we should 
not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie
locked up in its bottle forever. Sooner or later, it will out. 13:15I believe that the answer here
is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I.
such that even if -- when -- it escapes, it is still safe because it is
fundamentally on our side because it shares our values. I see no way around 
this difficult problem. 13:32Now, I'm actually fairly optimistic
that this problem can be solved. We wouldn't have to write down 
a long list of everything we care about, or worse yet, spell it out 
in some computer language like C++ or Python, that would be a task beyond hopeless. Instead, we would create an A.I.
that uses its intelligence to learn what we value, and its motivation system is constructed
in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions
that it predicts we would approve of. We would thus leverage 
its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value-loading. 14:12This can happen, and the outcome could be 
very good for humanity. But it doesn't happen automatically. The initial conditions 
for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up 
in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation. The values that the A.I. has
need to match ours, not just in the familiar context, like where we can easily check
how the A.I. behaves, but also in all novel contexts
that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. 14:42And there are also some esoteric issues
that would need to be solved, sorted out: the exact details of its decision theory, how to deal with logical
uncertainty and so forth. So the technical problems that need
to be solved to make this work look quite difficult -- not as difficult as making 
a superintelligent A.I., but fairly difficult. Here is the worry: Making superintelligent A.I.
is a really hard challenge. Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional 
challenge on top of that. The risk is that if somebody figures out
how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked 
the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety. 15:25So I think that we should
work out a solution to the control problem in advance, so that we have it available 
by the time it is needed. Now it might be that we cannot solve
the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements
can only be put in place once you know the details of the 
architecture where it will be implemented. But the more of the control problem
that we solve in advance, the better the odds that the transition
to the machine intelligence era will go well. 15:54This to me looks like a thing
that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if 
things turn out okay, that people a million years from now
look back at this century and it might well be that they say that
the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right. 16:12Thank you. 16:14(Applause)"
2,Can we learn to talk to sperm whales?,David Gruber,Apr 2021,"Animals are communicating -- but what are they saying? And can we talk back? Marine biologist David Gruber introduces Project CETI: a team of scientists, linguists and AI specialists hoping to decode sperm whale language.

of the largest-toothed predator on the planet: an animal bigger than a school bus with perhaps the most sophisticated
form of communication that has ever existed. 00:12(Video: whale clicking) 00:31These are the sounds
of the mighty sperm whale, a fellow mammal
that can dive almost a mile, hold its breath for more than an hour and lives in these amazingly complex,
matriarchal societies. These clicks you heard, called codas, are just a facet of what we know
of their communication. We know these animals are communicating, we just don't yet know
what they're saying. 00:54Project CETI aims to find out. Over the next five years, our team of AI specialists, roboticists, linguists and marine biologists aim to use the most
cutting-edge technologies to make contact with another species, and hopefully communicate back. We believe that by listening
deeply to nature, we can change our perspective of ourselves and reshape our relationship
with all life on this planet. 01:21This of course seems
like an impossible goal. People have been trying
to make contact with other animals for hundreds of years. How could we do what others could not, especially given that I'm sitting here
on my couch in New York City in the middle of a pandemic and protests? 01:37I've spent the last 20 years
as a marine biologist and oceanographer, studying the ocean
from all different perspectives, from microbes to sharks. I've assembled interdisciplinary teams that have built the first shark-eye camera to see the world
from a shark's perspective, and have collaborated with engineers to design robots so gentle
that they don't even stress a jellyfish. But it wasn't until 2018 when I was on fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study that I realized that perhaps the best way
to understand the ocean and its inhabitants wasn't just by seeing the world
through their eyes, but by listening -- by really, deeply listening. 02:16I became interested in sperm whales
when I heard their sounds. They sounded like they were
coming from another universe; a siren song being broadcast
from the darkest reaches of the sea. These weren't the typical
harmonious whale songs that I had been accustomed to. These sounded more
like digital data transfer. We assembled the future Project CETI team and began discussing how to use
the most advanced technologies to communicate with whales. One of the principal conclusions was that machine learning
had a really good chance of understanding the patterns
of sperm whale communication. And the time to apply
these technologies was now. Cracking the interspecies
communication code didn't just seem possible, it almost seemed inevitable. But how can analyzing patterns
help us converse with whales and other animals? 03:06Well, step one is to understand
the elements of sperm whale communication. These codas you heard don't appear
to be sentences as we know them, but there's clear structure
in how these animals communicate. Sperm whales send codas
back and forth to each other in sequences, and there are regional dialects
like British and Australian accents. This is exactly why machine learning
is such a powerful tool. These approaches analyze patterns
in relationship and map meaning to them. Just a few years ago,
scientists used machine learning to translate between two
totally unknown human languages. Not by using a Rosetta Stone
or a dictionary, but by mapping them on patterns
in higher-dimensional space. But for machine learning
to work effectively, it needs data -- it needs lots and lots of data. 03:54In the past half-century, marine researchers
have painstakingly collected and hand annotated just a few thousand
sperm whale vocalizations, but in order to learn
sperm whale communication, we'll need to collect millions, if not tens of millions of carefully annotated
sperm whale vocalizations correlated with behaviors. We'll do it with noninvasive,
autonomous, free-swimming robots, aerial-aquatic drones, bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays and more. 04:23We'll work with our close partners
at the Dominica Sperm Whale Project to cover a 20-square-kilometer area that is frequented by over 25
well-known families of sperm whales. We're going to put specific focus
on the interactions of mothers and calfs, training our machine learning algorithms to learn whale language
from the bottom up. All this data we'll have sent
through a pipeline and analyzed by the Project CETI
translation team. The raw audio and context data will
go through our machine learning engine where it's going to be first
sorted by structure. The linguistics team will then search
for things like syntax and time displacement. For example, if we find an event where a whale
was talking about something yesterday, that alone would be a major finding, something that has thus far
only been shown in humans. And once we've really mastered listening, we're going to try
really carefully to talk back even on the most simplistic level. 05:17Finally, Project CETI will build
an open-source platform where we will make our data sets
available to the public, encouraging the global community to come along on this journey
for understanding. These animals could be the most
intelligent beings on this planet. They have a neocortex and spindle cells -- structure that in humans
control our higher thoughts, emotions, memory, language and love. And all the platforms that we develop
can be cross-applied to other animals: to elephants, birds, primates, dolphins -- essentially any animal. 05:49In the late 1960s, our team member, Roger Payne,
discovered that whales sing. 05:54(Recording: whale singing) 05:56A finding that sparked
the Save the Whales movement led to the end of large-scale whaling and prevented several
whale species from extinction just by showing that whales sing. Imagine if we could understand
what they're saying. Now is the time
to open this larger dialogue. Now is the time to listen deeply and show these magical animals, and each other, newfound respect. 06:23Thank you."
2,Robots will invade our lives,Rodney Brooks,Sep 2008,"In this prophetic talk from 2003, roboticist Rodney Brooks talks about how robots are going to work their way into our lives -- starting with toys and moving into household chores ... and beyond.", (21K),"Transcript (20 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийбългарскиעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels, over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now, where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that? Are they going to be around in 50 years? Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common, and I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years, where the first few robots are starting to appear. 00:49Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong, a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots: LEGO Mindstorms, Furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a Furby? Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot, a simple robot with some sensors, a little bit of processing actuation. 01:19On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days, when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers, you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics, where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys -- the Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed, the PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there. 01:56And we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots, Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company. And then in the last 12 months or so we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive -- 3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it. 02:21But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles. If it hits something -- you people see that? Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see, let's -- oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies! (Laughter) Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart! (Laughter) See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it. It's grown-ups that get really upset. (Laughter) We'll just put some crap here. (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up. Yeah, OK. So -- we'll leave that for later. (Applause) 04:04Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually; the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists, and think that computation is everything, but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot, the PackBot, that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves, for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust, much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. (Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence: it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range, can go upstairs by itself, et cetera. Okay, so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does. That was not a controlled descent. (Laughter) Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile, things were just too -- there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated, and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these? Okay, good. So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. 06:50So one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments, 150˚ C, 10,000 PSI. Autonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work. But robots like this, they're a little hard to program. How, in the future, are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use? And I want to actually use a robot here -- a robot named Chris -- stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to -- Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh. (Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at -- so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle, and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that? (Laughter) Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. (Laughter) And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot, that's good. 08:45So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting, we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us, whether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing, and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you, you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space, so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window, and it looks for the highest-scoring place -- the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening -- and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time, some top-down sort of stuff: might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone, or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change. 10:12And over here on the right, this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie ""AI""? (Audience: Yes.) 10:19RB: Yeah, it was really bad, but -- 10:21remember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot, looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it? Well, this gets rid of that, because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative, and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else. So, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's Kismet, looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera, and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. (Laughter) But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view -- such as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right. It sees her, pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space, a vector space, of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space, it expresses -- can we have the volume on here? Can you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.) 11:32Kismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so? Do you really think so? 11:42RB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here, Chris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice, and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot: 12:08Voice: Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. (Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 12:17Voice: ...very good, Kismet. (Laughter) 12:24Voice: Look at my smile. 12:28RB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. 12:39Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is. 12:43RB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh. 12:55RB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot, and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. 13:01Voice: No. No. You're not to do that. No. (Laughter) 13:09Not appropriate. No. No. (Laughter) 13:18RB: I'm going to leave it at that. 13:20We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone, we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes, give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in, we didn't tell them anything about the robot, sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was, the robot wasn't understanding a word they said, and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this, where this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes -- (Laughter) -- says, ""I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch."" And he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision, points to it, gives it a motion cue, and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- Notice the turn-taking. Ritchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot: Oh, cool. Ritchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. (Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes. Ritchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure. RB: And they successfully have that sort of communication. 14:44And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot, Cog. They first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy, the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. (Laughter) So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are: if we make these robots more and more human-like, will we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually? And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over? (Laughter) And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here -- where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect. Well, do you ever need to give robots respect? They're just machines, after all. But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines. After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how, you know, Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges, and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines, then in principle at least, we should be able to build machines out of other stuff, which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that, we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years, at least. 500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun; 150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth, which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said, maybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really -- people didn't like that, we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know, having the idea that robots could really have emotions, or that robots could be living creatures -- I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so. 17:09And the second question is, will the machines want to take over? And here the standard scenario is that we create these things, they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us, and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like. (Laughter) But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is, you know, will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us? And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard, you know -- ""I accidentally built a 747."" I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think -- (Laughter) -- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot, and before that a not so bad robot. (Laughter) And we're just not going to let it go that way. (Laughter) So, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming, we don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun, and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years. (Applause)"
2,How brain science will change computing,Jeff Hawkins,May 2007,"Treo creator Jeff Hawkins urges us to take a new look at the brain -- to see it not as a fast processor, but as a memory system that stores and plays back experiences to help us predict, intelligently, what will happen next.", (52K),"Transcript (29 Languages)DanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsNorsk bokmålPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийбългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىქართული中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I do two things: I design mobile computers
and I study brains. Today's talk is about brains
and -- (Audience member cheers) Yay! I have a brain fan out there. 00:08(Laughter) If I could have my first slide, you'll see the title of my talk
and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why
we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important
that we should develop one and what we can do about it. I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me
from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit
scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience
Institute in Menlo Park. We study theoretical neuroscience
and how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that. 00:39I have one slide on my other life,
the computer life, and that's this slide here. These are some of the products
I've worked on over the last 20 years, starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on, ending up
most recently with the Treo, and we're continuing to do this. I've done this because
I believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I'm trying to make
the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was, I admit, all an accident. I really didn't want to do
any of these products. Very early in my career I decided I was not going to be
in the computer industry. 01:10Before that, I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti
I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture for Graffiti
that'll text input language. I found a website dedicated to teachers
who want to make script-writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added Graffiti to it,
and I'm sorry about that. 01:27(Laughter) 01:29So what happened was, when I was young and got out
of engineering school at Cornell in '79, I went to work for Intel
and was in the computer industry, and three months into that,
I fell in love with something else. I said, ""I made
the wrong career choice here,"" and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one, a line drawing. And I don't remember
exactly how it happened, but I have one recollection,
which was pretty strong in my mind. In September of 1979, Scientific American came out
with a single-topic issue about the brain. It was one of their best issues ever. They talked about the neuron,
development, disease, vision and all the things you might want
to know about brains. It was really quite impressive. 02:11One might've had the impression
we knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue
was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is, I think, the 50th anniversary
of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying,
this is all well and good, but you know, we don't know
diddly squat about brains, and no one has a clue how they work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote
from that article, he says: ""What is conspicuously lacking"" --
he's a very proper British gentleman -- ""What is conspicuously lacking
is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret
these different approaches."" I thought the word ""framework"" was great. He didn't say we didn't have a theory. He says we don't even know
how to begin to think about it. We don't even have a framework. We are in the pre-paradigm days,
if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. So I fell in love with this. I said, look: We have all this knowledge
about brains -- how hard can it be? It's something we can work on
in my lifetime; I could make a difference. So I tried to get out of the computer
business, into the brain business. 03:06First, I went to MIT,
the AI lab was there. I said, I want to build
intelligent machines too, but I want to study how brains work first. And they said, ""Oh, you
don't need to do that. You're just going to program
computers, that's all. I said, you really ought to study brains. They said, ""No, you're wrong."" I said, ""No, you're wrong,""
and I didn't get in. 03:23(Laughter) 03:24I was a little disappointed --
pretty young -- but I went back again a few years later, this time in California,
and I went to Berkeley. And I said, I'll go
in from the biological side. So I got in the PhD program in biophysics. I was like, I'm studying brains now.
Well, I want to study theory. They said, ""You can't
study theory about brains. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student,
you can't do that."" So I said, oh my gosh. I was depressed; I said, but I can
make a difference in this field. I went back in the computer industry and said, I'll have to work
here for a while. That's when I designed
all those computer products. 03:57(Laughter) 03:59I said, I want to do this
for four years, make some money, I was having a family,
and I would mature a bit, and maybe the business
of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well, it took longer than four years.
It's been about 16 years. But I'm doing it now,
and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory? Well, there's lots of reasons
people do science. The most basic one is,
people like to know things. We're curious, and we go out
and get knowledge. Why do we study ants? It's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something useful,
but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes a science
has other attributes which makes it really interesting. 04:34Sometimes a science will tell
something about ourselves; it'll tell us who we are. Evolution did this
and Copernicus did this, where we have a new
understanding of who we are. And after all, we are our brains.
My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride, but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand
who we are and how we feel and perceive, we need to understand brains. Another thing is sometimes science leads
to big societal benefits, technologies, or businesses or whatever. This is one, too, because
when we understand how brains work, we'll be able to build
intelligent machines. That's a good thing on the whole, with tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology. 05:11So why don't we have
a good theory of brains? People have been working
on it for 100 years. Let's first take a look
at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance
between theory and experimentalists. The theorist guy says,
""I think this is what's going on,"" the experimentalist says, ""You're wrong."" It goes back and forth,
this works in physics, this in geology. But if this is normal science,
what does neuroscience look like? This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data, which is anatomy, physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail
we know about brains. There were 28,000 people who went
to the neuroscience conference this year, and every one of them
is doing research in brains. A lot of data, but no theory. There's a little wimpy box on top there. 05:53And theory has not played a role
in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now, why has this come about? If you ask neuroscientists
why is this the state of affairs, first, they'll admit it. But if you ask them, they say, there's various reasons
we don't have a good brain theory. Some say we still don't have enough data, we need more information,
there's all these things we don't know. Well, I just told you there's data
coming out of your ears. We have so much information,
we don't even know how to organize it. What good is more going to do? Maybe we'll be lucky and discover
some magic thing, but I don't think so. This is a symptom of the fact
that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data,
we need a good theory. 06:31Another one is sometimes people say, ""Brains are so complex,
it'll take another 50 years."" I even think Chris said something
like this yesterday, something like, it's one of the most complicated
things in the universe. That's not true -- you're more
complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And although the brain
looks very complicated, things look complicated
until you understand them. That's always been the case. So we can say, my neocortex,
the part of the brain I'm interested in, has 30 billion cells. But, you know what?
It's very, very regular. In fact, it looks like it's the same thing
repeated over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks.
That's not the issue. 07:04Some people say,
brains can't understand brains. Very Zen-like. Woo. 07:09(Laughter) 07:11You know, it sounds good, but why?
I mean, what's the point? It's just a bunch of cells.
You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too, right? So, you know, I don't think
there's anything to that. And finally, some people say, ""I don't feel like a bunch
of cells -- I'm conscious. I've got this experience,
I'm in the world. I can't be just a bunch of cells."" Well, people used to believe
there was a life force to be living, and we now know
that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence, other than that people just disbelieve
that cells can do what they do. So some people have fallen
into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too,
but we can reject all that. 07:47(Laughter) 07:50No, there's something else, something really fundamental, and it is: another reason why we don't have
a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive,
strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us
from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just,
it's obvious, but it's wrong. Now, there's a history of this in science
and before I tell you what it is, I'll tell you about the history
of it in science. Look at other scientific revolutions -- the solar system, that's Copernicus, Darwin's evolution,
and tectonic plates, that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common
with brain science. 08:23First, they had a lot
of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable
once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped --
really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then; it just turns out it's really
hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them,
it's easy to understand. My daughters understood
these three theories, in their basic framework, in kindergarten. It's not that hard --
here's the apple, here's the orange, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff. 08:49Another thing is the answer
was there all along, but we kind of ignored it
because of this obvious thing. It was an intuitive,
strongly held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning, the surface is going
a thousand miles an hour, and it's going through the solar system
at a million miles an hour -- this is lunacy; we all know
the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving
a thousand miles an hour? If you said Earth was spinning
around in space and was huge -- they would lock you up,
that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious.
Now, what about evolution? 09:20Evolution, same thing. We taught our kids the Bible says
God created all these species, cats are cats; dogs are dogs;
people are people; plants are plants; they don't change. Noah put them on the ark
in that order, blah, blah. The fact is, if you believe in evolution,
we all have a common ancestor. We all have a common ancestor
with the plant in the lobby! This is what evolution tells us.
And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates. All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around
on top of the Earth. It doesn't make any sense. 09:50So what is the intuitive,
but incorrect assumption, that's kept us from understanding brains? I'll tell you. It'll seem obvious
that it's correct. That's the point. Then I'll make an argument why
you're incorrect on the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is: somehow, intelligence
is defined by behavior; we're intelligent
because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently. And I'm going to tell you that's wrong. Intelligence is defined by prediction. 10:15I'm going to work you
through this in a few slides, and give you an example
of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers and scientists
like to look at systems like this. They say, we have a thing in a box.
We have its inputs and outputs. The AI people said, the thing in the box
is a programmable computer, because it's equivalent to a brain. We'll feed it some inputs and get it
to do something, have some behavior. Alan Turing defined the Turing test,
which essentially says, we'll know if something's intelligent
if it behaves identical to a human -- a behavioral metric
of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds
for a long time. 10:47Reality, though --
I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence
is built on something else. We experience the world
through a sequence of patterns, and we store them, and we recall them. When we recall them,
we match them up against reality, and we're making predictions all the time. It's an internal metric;
there's an internal metric about us, saying, do we understand the world,
am I making predictions, and so on. You're all being intelligent now,
but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself,
but you're not doing anything. But you're being intelligent;
you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent
and you speak English, you know the word at the end of this sentence. 11:22The word came to you;
you make these predictions all the time. What I'm saying is, the internal prediction
is the output in the neocortex, and somehow, prediction
leads to intelligent behavior. Here's how that happens: Let's start with a non-intelligent brain. I'll argue a non-intelligent brain,
we'll call it an old brain. And we'll say it's
a non-mammal, like a reptile, say, an alligator; we have an alligator. And the alligator has
some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears
and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears
and emotions. It can eat you. It can attack.
It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider
the alligator very intelligent, not in a human sort of way. 12:06But it has all this complex
behavior already. Now in evolution, what happened? First thing that happened
in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing
called the neocortex. I'm going to represent the neocortex
by this box on top of the old brain. Neocortex means ""new layer.""
It's a new layer on top of your brain. It's the wrinkly thing
on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved
in there and doesn't fit. 12:28(Laughter) 12:30Literally, it's about the size
of a table napkin and doesn't fit, so it's wrinkly. Now, look at how I've drawn this. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain.
You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those gut reactions you have. On top of it, we have this memory system
called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting
over the sensory part of the brain. So as the sensory input
comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying, I'm going
to memorize all the things going on: where I've been, people I've seen,
things I've heard, and so on. And in the future, when it sees
something similar to that again, in a similar environment,
or the exact same environment, it'll start playing it back:
""Oh, I've been here before,"" and when you were here before,
this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It literally feeds back
the signals into your brain; they'll let you see
what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word
""sentence"" before I said it. And it's this feeding
back into the old brain that will allow you to make
more intelligent decisions. 13:32This is the most important slide
of my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little. And all the time you say,
""Oh, I can predict things,"" so if you're a rat and you go
through a maze, and you learn the maze, next time you're in one,
you have the same behavior. But suddenly, you're smarter;
you say, ""I recognize this maze, I know which way to go; I've been here
before; I can envision the future."" That's what it's doing. This is true for all mammals -- in humans, it got a lot worse. Humans actually developed
the front of the neocortex, called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior,
the back part, which is sensory, and put it in the front. Humans uniquely have
the same mechanism on the front, but we use it for motor control. 14:12So we're now able to do very sophisticated
motor planning, things like that. I don't have time to explain,
but to understand how a brain works, you have to understand how the first part
of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns
and make predictions. Let me give you
a few examples of predictions. I already said the word ""sentence."" In music, if you've heard a song before, when you hear it, the next note
pops into your head already -- you anticipate it. With an album, at the end of a song,
the next song pops into your head. It happens all the time,
you make predictions. 14:42I have this thing called
the ""altered door"" thought experiment. It says, you have a door at home; when you're here, I'm changing it -- I've got a guy back at your house
right now, moving the door around, moving your doorknob over two inches. When you go home tonight, you'll put
your hand out, reach for the doorknob, notice it's in the wrong spot and go, ""Whoa, something happened."" It may take a second,
but something happened. I can change your doorknob
in other ways -- make it larger, smaller, change
its brass to silver, make it a lever, I can change the door;
put colors on, put windows in. I can change a thousand things
about your door and in the two seconds
you take to open it, you'll notice something has changed. 15:17Now, the engineering approach,
the AI approach to this, is to build a door database
with all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door,
we check them off one at time: door, door, color ... We don't do that.
Your brain doesn't do that. Your brain is making
constant predictions all the time about what will happen
in your environment. As I put my hand on this table,
I expect to feel it stop. When I walk, every step,
if I missed it by an eighth of an inch, I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions
about your environment. I'll talk about vision, briefly. This is a picture of a woman. When we look at people, our eyes saccade
over two to three times a second. We're not aware of it,
but our eyes are always moving. When we look at a face, we typically
go from eye to eye to nose to mouth. When your eye moves from eye to eye, if there was something
else there like a nose, you'd see a nose where an eye
is supposed to be and go, ""Oh, shit!"" 16:04(Laughter) 16:05""There's something wrong
about this person."" That's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over and say,
""What am I seeing? A nose? OK."" No, you have an expectation
of what you're going to see. 16:16Every single moment. And finally, let's think
about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction:
What is the next word in this ...? This is to this as this is to this.
What is the next number in this sentence? Here's three visions of an object.
What's the fourth one? That's how we test it.
It's all about prediction. 16:32So what is the recipe for brain theory? First of all, we have to have
the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework, not a computational or behavior framework, it's a memory framework. How do you store and recall
these sequences of patterns? It's spatiotemporal patterns. 16:46Then, if in that framework,
you take a bunch of theoreticians -- biologists generally
are not good theoreticians. Not always, but generally, there's not
a good history of theory in biology. I've found the best people
to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn
the anatomy and the physiology. You have to make these theories
very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who tells you their theory
about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly
how it's working and how the wiring works -- it's not a theory. 17:16And that's what we do
at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I'd love to tell you we're making
fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back on this stage
sometime in the not too distant future, to tell you about it. I'm really excited;
this is not going to take 50 years. 17:30What will brain theory look like? First of all, it's going
to be about memory. Not like computer memory --
not at all like computer memory. It's very different. It's a memory of very
high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences: you cannot learn or recall anything
outside of a sequence. A song must be heard
in sequence over time, and you must play it back
in sequence over time. And these sequences
are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something,
it reminds me of it, and it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs
is the desired output. And as I said, the theory
must be biologically accurate, it must be testable
and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it,
you don't understand it. 18:10One more slide. What is this going to result in? Are we going to really build
intelligent machines? Absolutely. And it's going to be
different than people think. No doubt that it's going
to happen, in my mind. First of all, we're going to build
this stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use to build
silicon computer memories, we can use here. But they're very different
types of memories. And we'll attach
these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience
real-live, real-world data, and learn about their environment. 18:38Now, it's very unlikely the first things
you'll see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful;
people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part.
That's old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is easier
than the old brain. So first we'll do things
that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C-3PO. You're going to see things
more like intelligent cars that really understand
what traffic is, what driving is and have learned that cars
with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn. 19:06(Laughter) 19:07We can also do intelligent
security systems. Anytime we're basically using our brain
but not doing a lot of mechanics -- those are the things
that will happen first. But ultimately, the world's the limit. I don't know how this will turn out. I know a lot of people who invented
the microprocessor. And if you talk to them, they knew what they were doing
was really significant, but they didn't really know
what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate
cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like,
""We're going to build calculators and traffic-light controllers. But it's going to be big!"" In the same way, brain science
and these memories are going to be a very
fundamental technology, and it will lead to unbelievable changes
in the next 100 years. And I'm most excited about
how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time -- I'm over, and I'm going to end my talk right there."
2,Can machines read your emotions?,Kostas Karpouzis,Nov 2016,"Computers can beat us in board games, transcribe speech, and instantly identify almost any object.

in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines 
and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us
or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion
be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains
interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman
identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood
the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile
signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly
getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,
such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that
mimic our biological neurons by forming connections 
and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs
pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify
those samples by adjusting the relative weights
assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes
at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences
to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just
limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,
and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence
structure in our writing. You might think that training
neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much 
data is out there, and how quickly modern computers
can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor
physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect
enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses
for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify
facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people
with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering
using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts
that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help
treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost
automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network
automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs
is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy
when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit
our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify
the people likely to commit crimes before they even make 
a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,
like irony, and scales of emotions,
just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able
to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear
of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story."

given by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, ""What is invisible?"" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, ""Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Why can't I?"" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called ""blas,"" meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
""What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?"" And he said, ""Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, ""We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything."" And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
""What's another thing we can't see?"" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. ""Why are we here?"", and ""What should
we do about it while we are?"" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, ""I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves."" (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, ""We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others
are here for, I've no idea."" (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)"
2,What moral decisions should driverless cars make?,Iyad Rahwan,Aug 2017,"Should your driverless car kill you if it means saving five pedestrians? In this primer on the social dilemmas of driverless cars, Iyad Rahwan explores how the technology will challenge our morality and explains his work collecting data from real people on the ethical trade-offs we're willing (and not willing) to make.", (37K),"Transcript (21 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01Today I'm going to talk
about technology and society. The Department of Transport
estimated that last year 35,000 people died
from traffic crashes in the US alone. Worldwide, 1.2 million people
die every year in traffic accidents. If there was a way we could eliminate
90 percent of those accidents, would you support it? Of course you would. This is what driverless car technology
promises to achieve by eliminating the main
source of accidents -- human error. 00:37Now picture yourself
in a driverless car in the year 2030, sitting back and watching
this vintage TEDxCambridge video. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49All of a sudden, the car experiences mechanical failure
and is unable to stop. If the car continues, it will crash into a bunch
of pedestrians crossing the street, but the car may swerve, hitting one bystander, killing them to save the pedestrians. What should the car do,
and who should decide? What if instead the car
could swerve into a wall, crashing and killing you, the passenger, in order to save those pedestrians? This scenario is inspired
by the trolley problem, which was invented
by philosophers a few decades ago to think about ethics. 01:34Now, the way we think
about this problem matters. We may for example
not think about it at all. We may say this scenario is unrealistic, incredibly unlikely, or just silly. But I think this criticism
misses the point because it takes
the scenario too literally. Of course no accident
is going to look like this; no accident has two or three options where everybody dies somehow. Instead, the car is going
to calculate something like the probability of hitting
a certain group of people, if you swerve one direction
versus another direction, you might slightly increase the risk
to passengers or other drivers versus pedestrians. It's going to be
a more complex calculation, but it's still going
to involve trade-offs, and trade-offs often require ethics. 02:27We might say then,
""Well, let's not worry about this. Let's wait until technology
is fully ready and 100 percent safe."" Suppose that we can indeed
eliminate 90 percent of those accidents, or even 99 percent in the next 10 years. What if eliminating
the last one percent of accidents requires 50 more years of research? Should we not adopt the technology? That's 60 million people
dead in car accidents if we maintain the current rate. So the point is, waiting for full safety is also a choice, and it also involves trade-offs. 03:11People online on social media
have been coming up with all sorts of ways to not think about this problem. One person suggested
the car should just swerve somehow in between the passengers -- 03:23(Laughter) 03:24and the bystander. Of course if that's what the car can do,
that's what the car should do. We're interested in scenarios
in which this is not possible. And my personal favorite
was a suggestion by a blogger to have an eject button in the car
that you press -- 03:41(Laughter) 03:43just before the car self-destructs. 03:44(Laughter) 03:47So if we acknowledge that cars
will have to make trade-offs on the road, how do we think about those trade-offs, and how do we decide? Well, maybe we should run a survey
to find out what society wants, because ultimately, regulations and the law
are a reflection of societal values. 04:08So this is what we did. With my collaborators, Jean-François Bonnefon and Azim Shariff, we ran a survey in which we presented people
with these types of scenarios. We gave them two options
inspired by two philosophers: Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant. Bentham says the car
should follow utilitarian ethics: it should take the action
that will minimize total harm -- even if that action will kill a bystander and even if that action
will kill the passenger. Immanuel Kant says the car
should follow duty-bound principles, like ""Thou shalt not kill."" So you should not take an action
that explicitly harms a human being, and you should let the car take its course even if that's going to harm more people. 04:55What do you think? Bentham or Kant? Here's what we found. Most people sided with Bentham. So it seems that people
want cars to be utilitarian, minimize total harm, and that's what we should all do. Problem solved. But there is a little catch. When we asked people
whether they would purchase such cars, they said, ""Absolutely not."" 05:21(Laughter) 05:23They would like to buy cars
that protect them at all costs, but they want everybody else
to buy cars that minimize harm. 05:31(Laughter) 05:34We've seen this problem before. It's called a social dilemma. And to understand the social dilemma, we have to go a little bit
back in history. In the 1800s, English economist William Forster Lloyd
published a pamphlet which describes the following scenario. You have a group of farmers -- English farmers -- who are sharing a common land
for their sheep to graze. Now, if each farmer
brings a certain number of sheep -- let's say three sheep -- the land will be rejuvenated, the farmers are happy, the sheep are happy, everything is good. Now, if one farmer brings one extra sheep, that farmer will do slightly better,
and no one else will be harmed. But if every farmer made
that individually rational decision, the land will be overrun,
and it will be depleted to the detriment of all the farmers, and of course,
to the detriment of the sheep. 06:32We see this problem in many places: in the difficulty of managing overfishing, or in reducing carbon emissions
to mitigate climate change. When it comes to the regulation
of driverless cars, the common land now
is basically public safety -- that's the common good -- and the farmers are the passengers or the car owners who are choosing
to ride in those cars. And by making the individually
rational choice of prioritizing their own safety, they may collectively be
diminishing the common good, which is minimizing total harm. It's called the tragedy of the commons, traditionally, but I think in the case
of driverless cars, the problem may be
a little bit more insidious because there is not necessarily
an individual human being making those decisions. So car manufacturers
may simply program cars that will maximize safety
for their clients, and those cars may learn
automatically on their own that doing so requires slightly
increasing risk for pedestrians. So to use the sheep metaphor, it's like we now have electric sheep
that have a mind of their own. 07:52(Laughter) 07:54And they may go and graze
even if the farmer doesn't know it. 07:58So this is what we may call
the tragedy of the algorithmic commons, and if offers new types of challenges. Typically, traditionally, we solve these types
of social dilemmas using regulation, so either governments
or communities get together, and they decide collectively
what kind of outcome they want and what sort of constraints
on individual behavior they need to implement. And then using monitoring and enforcement, they can make sure
that the public good is preserved. So why don't we just, as regulators, require that all cars minimize harm? After all, this is
what people say they want. And more importantly, I can be sure that as an individual, if I buy a car that may
sacrifice me in a very rare case, I'm not the only sucker doing that while everybody else
enjoys unconditional protection. 08:57In our survey, we did ask people
whether they would support regulation and here's what we found. First of all, people
said no to regulation; and second, they said, ""Well if you regulate cars to do this
and to minimize total harm, I will not buy those cars."" So ironically, by regulating cars to minimize harm, we may actually end up with more harm because people may not
opt into the safer technology even if it's much safer
than human drivers. 09:30I don't have the final
answer to this riddle, but I think as a starting point, we need society to come together to decide what trade-offs
we are comfortable with and to come up with ways
in which we can enforce those trade-offs. 09:46As a starting point,
my brilliant students, Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza, built the Moral Machine website, which generates random scenarios at you -- basically a bunch
of random dilemmas in a sequence where you have to choose what
the car should do in a given scenario. And we vary the ages and even
the species of the different victims. So far we've collected
over five million decisions by over one million people worldwide from the website. And this is helping us
form an early picture of what trade-offs
people are comfortable with and what matters to them -- even across cultures. But more importantly, doing this exercise
is helping people recognize the difficulty of making those choices and that the regulators
are tasked with impossible choices. And maybe this will help us as a society
understand the kinds of trade-offs that will be implemented
ultimately in regulation. 10:50And indeed, I was very happy to hear that the first set of regulations that came from
the Department of Transport -- announced last week -- included a 15-point checklist
for all carmakers to provide, and number 14 was ethical consideration -- how are you going to deal with that. We also have people
reflect on their own decisions by giving them summaries
of what they chose. I'll give you one example -- I'm just going to warn you
that this is not your typical example, your typical user. This is the most sacrificed and the most
saved character for this person. 11:28(Laughter) 11:34Some of you may agree with him, or her, we don't know. But this person also seems to slightly
prefer passengers over pedestrians in their choices and is very happy to punish jaywalking. 11:51(Laughter) 11:57So let's wrap up. We started with the question --
let's call it the ethical dilemma -- of what the car should do
in a specific scenario: swerve or stay? But then we realized
that the problem was a different one. It was the problem of how to get
society to agree on and enforce the trade-offs they're comfortable with. It's a social dilemma. 12:17In the 1940s, Isaac Asimov
wrote his famous laws of robotics -- the three laws of robotics. A robot may not harm a human being, a robot may not disobey a human being, and a robot may not allow
itself to come to harm -- in this order of importance. But after 40 years or so and after so many stories
pushing these laws to the limit, Asimov introduced the zeroth law which takes precedence above all, and it's that a robot
may not harm humanity as a whole. I don't know what this means
in the context of driverless cars or any specific situation, and I don't know how we can implement it, but I think that by recognizing that the regulation of driverless cars
is not only a technological problem but also a societal cooperation problem, I hope that we can at least begin
to ask the right questions. 13:17Thank you. 13:18(Applause)"
2,The jobs we'll lose to machines — and the ones we won't,Anthony Goldbloom,Aug 2016,"Machine learning isn't just for simple tasks like assessing credit risk and sorting mail anymore -- today, it's capable of far more complex applications, like grading essays and diagnosing diseases. With these advances comes an uneasy question: Will a robot do your job in the future?", (87K),"Transcript (46 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuDanskDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsNorsk bokmålPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάМонголРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىमराठीहिन्दीதமிழ்ภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00So this is my niece. Her name is Yahli. She is nine months old. Her mum is a doctor,
and her dad is a lawyer. By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do
are going to look dramatically different. 00:15footnotefootnoteIn 2013, researchers at Oxford University
did a study on the future of work. They concluded that almost one
in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. Machine learning is the technology that's responsible for most
of this disruption. It's the most powerful branch
of artificial intelligence. It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things
that humans can do. My company, Kaggle, operates
on the cutting edge of machine learning. We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems
for industry and academia. This gives us a unique perspective
on what machines can do, what they can't do and what jobs they might
automate or threaten. 00:57Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s. It started with relatively simple tasks. It started with things like assessing
credit risk from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading
handwritten characters from zip codes. Over the past few years, we have made
dramatic breakthroughs. Machine learning is now capable
of far, far more complex tasks. In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm
that could grade high-school essays. The winning algorithms
were able to match the grades given by human teachers. Last year, we issued
an even more difficult challenge. Can you take images of the eye
and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy? Again, the winning algorithms
were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists. 01:45footnotefootnoteNow, given the right data,
machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this. A teacher might read 10,000 essays
over a 40-year career. An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes. A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes within minutes. We have no chance of competing
against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks. 02:08But there are things we can do
that machines can't do. Where machines have made
very little progress is in tackling novel situations. They can't handle things
they haven't seen many times before. The fundamental limitations
of machine learning is that it needs to learn
from large volumes of past data. Now, humans don't. We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we've never seen before. 02:34Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron
was melting his chocolate bar. He was able to connect his understanding
of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses? --
the microwave oven. 02:51Now, this is a particularly remarkable
example of creativity. But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day. Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling
novel situations, and this puts a fundamental limit
on the human tasks that machines will automate. 03:10So what does this mean
for the future of work? The future state of any single job lies
in the answer to a single question: To what extent is that job reducible
to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what extent does it involve
tackling novel situations? On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter. Today they grade essays.
They diagnose certain diseases. Over coming years,
they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read boilerplate
from legal contracts. Accountants and lawyers are still needed. They're going to be needed
for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation. But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. 03:48Now, as mentioned, machines are not making progress
on novel situations. The copy behind a marketing campaign
needs to grab consumers' attention. It has to stand out from the crowd. Business strategy means
finding gaps in the market, things that nobody else is doing. It will be humans that are creating
the copy behind our marketing campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing
our business strategy. 04:09So Yahli, whatever you decide to do, let every day bring you a new challenge. If it does, then you will stay
ahead of the machines. 04:19Thank you. 04:20(Applause)"
2,AI isn't as smart as you think — but it could be,Jeff Dean,Oct 2021,"What is AI, really? Jeff Dean, the head of Google's AI efforts, explains the underlying technology that enables artificial intelligence to do all sorts of things, from understanding language to diagnosing disease -- and presents a roadmap for building better, more responsible systems that have a deeper understanding of the world. (Followed by a Q&A with head of TED Chris Anderson)", (55K),"Transcript (10 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisTiếng ViệtРусскийالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Hi, I'm Jeff. I lead AI Research and Health at Google. I joined Google more than 20 years ago, when we were all wedged
into a tiny office space, above what's now a T-Mobile store
in downtown Palo Alto. I've seen a lot of computing
transformations in that time, and in the last decade, we've seen AI
be able to do tremendous things. But we're still doing it
all wrong in many ways. That's what I want
to talk to you about today. 00:27But first, let's talk
about what AI can do. So in the last decade,
we've seen tremendous progress in how AI can help computers see,
understand language, understand speech better than ever before. Things that we couldn't do
before, now we can do. If you think about computer vision alone, just in the last 10 years, computers have effectively
developed the ability to see; 10 years ago, they couldn't see,
now they can see. You can imagine this has had
a transformative effect on what we can do with computers. 00:56So let's look at a couple
of the great applications enabled by these capabilities. We can better predict flooding,
keep everyone safe, using machine learning. We can translate over 100 languages
so we all can communicate better, and better predict and diagnose disease, where everyone gets
the treatment that they need. 01:13So let's look at two key components that underlie the progress
in AI systems today. The first is neural networks, a breakthrough approach to solving
some of these difficult problems that has really shone
in the last 15 years. But they're not a new idea. And the second is computational power. It actually takes a lot
of computational power to make neural networks
able to really sing, and in the last 15 years,
we’ve been able to have that, and that's partly what's enabled
all this progress. But at the same time,
I think we're doing several things wrong, and that's what I want
to talk to you about at the end of the talk. 01:46First, a bit of a history lesson. So for decades, almost since the very
beginning of computing, people have wanted
to be able to build computers that could see, understand language,
understand speech. The earliest approaches
to this, generally, people were trying to hand-code
all the algorithms that you need to accomplish
those difficult tasks, and it just turned out
to not work very well. But in the last 15 years,
a single approach unexpectedly advanced all these different
problem spaces all at once: neural networks. 02:17So neural networks are not a new idea. They're kind of loosely based on some of the properties
that are in real neural systems. And many of the ideas
behind neural networks have been around since the 1960s and 70s. A neural network is what it sounds like, a series of interconnected
artificial neurons that loosely emulate the properties
of your real neurons. An individual neuron
in one of these systems has a set of inputs, each with an associated weight, and the output of a neuron is a function of those inputs
multiplied by those weights. So pretty simple, and lots and lots of these work together
to learn complicated things. 02:52So how do we actually learn
in a neural network? It turns out the learning process consists of repeatedly making
tiny little adjustments to the weight values, strengthening the influence
of some things, weakening the influence of others. By driving the overall system
towards desired behaviors, these systems can be trained
to do really complicated things, like translate
from one language to another, detect what kind
of objects are in a photo, all kinds of complicated things. 03:20I first got interested in neural networks when I took a class on them
as an undergraduate in 1990. At that time, neural networks showed
impressive results on tiny problems, but they really couldn't scale to do
real-world important tasks. But I was super excited. 03:36(Laughter) 03:38I felt maybe we just needed
more compute power. And the University of Minnesota
had a 32-processor machine. I thought, ""With more compute power, boy, we could really make
neural networks really sing."" So I decided to do a senior thesis
on parallel training of neural networks, the idea of using processors in a computer
or in a computer system to all work toward the same task, that of training neural networks. 32 processors, wow, we’ve got to be able
to do great things with this. 04:05But I was wrong. Turns out we needed about a million times
as much computational power as we had in 1990 before we could actually get
neural networks to do impressive things. But starting around 2005, thanks to the computing progress
of Moore's law, we actually started to have
that much computing power, and researchers in a few universities
around the world started to see success in using neural networks for a wide
variety of different kinds of tasks. I and a few others at Google
heard about some of these successes, and we decided to start a project
to train very large neural networks. One system that we trained, we trained with 10 million
randomly selected frames from YouTube videos. The system developed the capability to recognize all kinds
of different objects. And it being YouTube, of course, it developed the ability
to recognize cats. YouTube is full of cats. 04:55(Laughter) 04:56But what made that so remarkable is that the system was never told
what a cat was. So using just patterns in data, the system honed in on the concept
of a cat all on its own. All of this occurred at the beginning
of a decade-long string of successes, of using neural networks
for a huge variety of tasks, at Google and elsewhere. Many of the things you use every day, things like better speech
recognition for your phone, improved understanding
of queries and documents for better search quality, better understanding of geographic
information to improve maps, and so on. 05:28Around that time, we also got excited about how we could
build hardware that was better tailored to the kinds of computations
neural networks wanted to do. Neural network computations
have two special properties. The first is they're very tolerant
of reduced precision. Couple of significant digits,
you don't need six or seven. And the second is that all the
algorithms are generally composed of different sequences
of matrix and vector operations. So if you can build a computer that is really good at low-precision
matrix and vector operations but can't do much else, that's going to be great
for neural-network computation, even though you can't use it
for a lot of other things. And if you build such things,
people will find amazing uses for them. This is the first one we built, TPU v1. ""TPU"" stands for Tensor Processing Unit. These have been used for many years
behind every Google search, for translation, in the DeepMind AlphaGo matches, so Lee Sedol and Ke Jie
maybe didn't realize, but they were competing
against racks of TPU cards. And we've built a bunch
of subsequent versions of TPUs that are even better and more exciting. 06:28But despite all these successes, I think we're still doing
many things wrong, and I'll tell you about three
key things we're doing wrong, and how we'll fix them. The first is that most
neural networks today are trained to do one thing,
and one thing only. You train it for a particular task
that you might care deeply about, but it's a pretty heavyweight activity. You need to curate a data set, you need to decide
what network architecture you'll use for this problem, you need to initialize the weights
with random values, apply lots of computation
to make adjustments to the weights. And at the end, if you’re lucky,
you end up with a model that is really good
at that task you care about. But if you do this over and over, you end up with thousands
of separate models, each perhaps very capable, but separate for all the different
tasks you care about. 07:11But think about how people learn. In the last year, many of us
have picked up a bunch of new skills. I've been honing my gardening skills, experimenting with vertical
hydroponic gardening. To do that, I didn't need to relearn
everything I already knew about plants. I was able to know
how to put a plant in a hole, how to pour water, that plants need sun, and leverage that
in learning this new skill. Computers can work
the same way, but they don’t today. If you train a neural
network from scratch, it's effectively like forgetting
your entire education every time you try to do something new. That’s crazy, right? 07:46So instead, I think we can
and should be training multitask models that can do
thousands or millions of different tasks. Each part of that model would specialize
in different kinds of things. And then, if we have a model
that can do a thousand things, and the thousand and first
thing comes along, we can leverage
the expertise we already have in the related kinds of things so that we can more quickly be able
to do this new task, just like you, if you're confronted
with some new problem, you quickly identify
the 17 things you already know that are going to be helpful
in solving that problem. 08:17Second problem is that most
of our models today deal with only a single
modality of data -- with images, or text or speech, but not all of these all at once. But think about how you
go about the world. You're continuously using all your senses to learn from, react to, figure out what actions
you want to take in the world. Makes a lot more sense to do that, and we can build models in the same way. We can build models that take in
these different modalities of input data, text, images, speech, but then fuse them together, so that regardless of whether the model
sees the word ""leopard,"" sees a video of a leopard
or hears someone say the word ""leopard,"" the same response
is triggered inside the model: the concept of a leopard can deal with different
kinds of input data, even nonhuman inputs,
like genetic sequences, 3D clouds of points,
as well as images, text and video. 09:08The third problem
is that today's models are dense. There's a single model, the model is fully activated
for every task, for every example
that we want to accomplish, whether that's a really simple
or a really complicated thing. This, too, is unlike
how our own brains work. Different parts of our brains
are good at different things, and we're continuously calling
upon the pieces of them that are relevant for the task at hand. For example, nervously watching
a garbage truck back up towards your car, the part of your brain that thinks
about Shakespearean sonnets is probably inactive. 09:41(Laughter) 09:42AI models can work the same way. Instead of a dense model, we can have one
that is sparsely activated. So for particular different tasks,
we call upon different parts of the model. During training, the model can also learn
which parts are good at which things, to continuously identify what parts
it wants to call upon in order to accomplish a new task. The advantage of this is we can have
a very high-capacity model, but it's very efficient, because we're only calling
upon the parts that we need for any given task. 10:11So fixing these three things, I think, will lead to a more powerful AI system: instead of thousands of separate models, train a handful of general-purpose models that can do thousands
or millions of things. Instead of dealing with single modalities, deal with all modalities, and be able to fuse them together. And instead of dense models,
use sparse, high-capacity models, where we call upon the relevant
bits as we need them. 10:33We've been building a system
that enables these kinds of approaches, and we’ve been calling
the system “Pathways.” So the idea is this model
will be able to do thousands or millions of different tasks, and then, we can incrementally
add new tasks, and it can deal
with all modalities at once, and then incrementally learn
new tasks as needed and call upon the relevant
bits of the model for different examples or tasks. And we're pretty excited about this, we think this is going
to be a step forward in how we build AI systems. 11:00But I also wanted
to touch on responsible AI. We clearly need to make sure
that this vision of powerful AI systems benefits everyone. These kinds of models raise
important new questions about how do we build them with fairness, interpretability, privacy and security, for all users in mind. 11:21For example, if we're going
to train these models on thousands or millions of tasks, we'll need to be able to train them
on large amounts of data. And we need to make sure that data
is thoughtfully collected and is representative of different
communities and situations all around the world. And data concerns are only
one aspect of responsible AI. We have a lot of work to do here. 11:43So in 2018, Google published
this set of AI principles by which we think about developing
these kinds of technology. And these have helped guide us
in how we do research in this space, how we use AI in our products. And I think it's a really helpful
and important framing for how to think about these deep
and complex questions about how we should
be using AI in society. We continue to update these
as we learn more. Many of these kinds of principles
are active areas of research -- super important area. 12:12Moving from single-purpose systems
that kind of recognize patterns in data to these kinds of general-purpose
intelligent systems that have a deeper
understanding of the world will really enable us to tackle some of the greatest problems
humanity faces. For example, we’ll be able to diagnose more disease; we'll be able to engineer better medicines by infusing these models
with knowledge of chemistry and physics; we'll be able to advance
educational systems by providing more individualized tutoring to help people learn
in new and better ways; we’ll be able to tackle
really complicated issues, like climate change, and perhaps engineering
of clean energy solutions. So really, all of these kinds of systems are going to be requiring
the multidisciplinary expertise of people all over the world. So connecting AI
with whatever field you are in, in order to make progress. 13:01So I've seen a lot
of advances in computing, and how computing, over the past decades, has really helped millions of people
better understand the world around them. And AI today has the potential
to help billions of people. We truly live in exciting times. 13:16Thank you. 13:17(Applause) 13:27Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple things. This is what I heard. Most people's traditional picture of AI is that computers recognize
a pattern of information, and with a bit of machine learning, they can get really good at that,
better than humans. What you're saying is those patterns are no longer the atoms
that AI is working with, that it's much richer-layered concepts that can include all manners
of types of things that go to make up a leopard, for example. So what could that lead to? Give me an example
of when that AI is working, what do you picture happening in the world in the next five or 10 years
that excites you? 14:11Jeff Dean: I think
the grand challenge in AI is how do you generalize
from a set of tasks you already know how to do to new tasks, as easily and effortlessly as possible. And the current approach of training
separate models for everything means you need lots of data
about that particular problem, because you're effectively trying
to learn everything about the world
and that problem, from nothing. But if you can build these systems that already are infused with how to do
thousands and millions of tasks, then you can effectively
teach them to do a new thing with relatively few examples. 14:44So I think that's the real hope, that you could then have a system
where you just give it five examples of something you care about, and it learns to do that new task. 14:54CA: You can do a form
of self-supervised learning that is based on remarkably
little seeding. 14:59JD: Yeah, as opposed to needing
10,000 or 100,000 examples to figure everything in the world out. 15:04CA: Aren't there kind of terrifying
unintended consequences possible, from that? 15:08JD: I think it depends
on how you apply these systems. It's very clear that AI
can be a powerful system for good, or if you apply it in ways
that are not so great, it can be a negative consequence. So I think that's why it's important
to have a set of principles by which you look at potential uses of AI and really are careful and thoughtful
about how you consider applications. 15:31CA: One of the things
people worry most about is that, if AI is so good at learning
from the world as it is, it's going to carry forward
into the future aspects of the world as it is
that actually aren't right, right now. And there's obviously been
a huge controversy about that recently at Google. Some of those principles
of AI development, you've been challenged that you're not
actually holding to them. Not really interested to hear
about comments on a specific case, but ... are you really committed? How do we know that you are
committed to these principles? Is that just PR, or is that real,
at the heart of your day-to-day? 16:11JD: No, that is absolutely real. Like, we have literally hundreds of people working on many of these
related research issues, because many of those
things are research topics in their own right. How do you take data from the real world, that is the world as it is,
not as we would like it to be, and how do you then use that
to train a machine-learning model and adapt the data bit of the scene or augment the data with additional data so that it can better reflect
the values we want the system to have, not the values that it sees in the world? 16:42CA: But you work for Google, Google is funding the research. How do we know that the main values
that this AI will build are for the world, and not, for example, to maximize
the profitability of an ad model? When you know everything
there is to know about human attention, you're going to know so much about the little wriggly,
weird, dark parts of us. In your group, are there rules
about how you hold off, church-state wall
between a sort of commercial push, ""You must do it for this purpose,"" so that you can inspire
your engineers and so forth, to do this for the world, for all of us. 17:21JD: Yeah, our research group
does collaborate with a number of groups across Google, including the Ads group,
the Search group, the Maps group, so we do have some collaboration,
but also a lot of basic research that we publish openly. We've published more
than 1,000 papers last year in different topics,
including the ones you discussed, about fairness, interpretability
of the machine-learning models, things that are super important, and we need to advance
the state of the art in this in order to continue to make progress to make sure these models
are developed safely and responsibly. 17:52CA: It feels like we're at a time
when people are concerned about the power of the big tech companies, and it's almost, if there was ever
a moment to really show the world that this is being done
to make a better future, that is actually key to Google's future, as well as all of ours. 18:09JD: Indeed. 18:10CA: It's very good to hear you
come and say that, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming here to TED. 18:15JD: Thank you. 18:16(Applause)"
2,A new way to monitor vital signs (that can see through walls),Dina Katabi,Jul 2018,"At MIT, Dina Katabi and her team are working on a bold new way to monitor patients' vital signs in a hospital (or even at home), without wearables or bulky, beeping devices. Bonus: it can see through walls. In a mind-blowing talk and demo, Katabi previews a system that captures the reflections of signals like Wi-Fi as they bounce off people, creating a reliable record of vitals for healthcare workers and patients. And in a brief Q&A with TED curator Helen Walters, Katabi discusses...", (48K),"Transcript (16 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeРусскийالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:01When I was a kid, I was, like many of you in this room,
very much fascinated by Star Wars, and what fascinated me the most
is this notion of the Force, this energy that connects
all people and all objects and allows you to feel people
that you can't even see. And I remember many nights,
I would be sitting at home, just, like, concentrating and focusing,
trying to feel the Force, and I didn't feel anything, don't worry. 00:29(Laughter) 00:31And later in life, I became a scientist. I joined the MIT faculty
and started working on wireless signals. These are things like Wi-Fi
or cellular systems, and I did a lot of work in that domain. But then, again, this Force thing
kept nagging me, and at some point, I was just like, ""Wait a minute, these wireless signals --
they are like the Force."" 00:56So if you think about it, wireless signals,
they travel through space, they go through obstacles
and walls and occlusions, and some of them, they reflect off our bodies,
because our bodies are full of water, and some of these minute reflections, they come back. And if, just if, I had a device that can
just sense these minute reflections, then I would be able to feel people
that I cannot see. So I started working with my students
on building such a device, and I want to show you
some of our early results. 01:32So here, you see my student standing, and here is our device. And we are going to put the device
in the other office, behind the wall, and we are going
to monitor him as he moves. This red dot is tracking him
using wireless signals. And as you can see, the red dot
is tracking his movements very accurately, purely based on how his body interacts
with the surrounding wireless signals. Pretty accurate, isn't it? He has no wearables, nothing. 02:06(Applause) 02:09Now you might be wondering, how is it possible
that we can sense people and track them, without
any wearables, through walls, and the easiest analogy
to think about is radar. I'm sure many of you
have seen this picture. You transmit a wireless signal to the sky, it reflects off some airplane,
comes back to you, and you start detecting these airplanes. 02:32But if it were just radar, then we would have this 50 years ago. So it's not just radar. There are two key differences. So the first difference, of course -- you can't, like radar, just blast
wireless power at somebody. You're going to fry them
like if they were in a microwave. Don't do that. So it means that you have to be able
to deal with very weak signals, and that means that your device
has to be very sensitive. The second difference is that,
unlike the sky, where it's empty -- if you are lucky, there is one airplane
that you can catch there. Like, look at the room and look how many objects
and people there are. So in indoor environments, the signal
not only reflects off the person, if reflects off the person,
off the floor, the ceiling, off other people around, and you get very complex reflections where the same signal reflects
off me and then off you, and then off the ceiling,
then off the floor. And you have to make sense of that mess. 03:35But we were lucky. We were coming at the right time. So two things helped us. The first thing is radiotechnologies
have evolved a lot, and over the last decade, radio technology
became much more powerful, so we were able to build
very sensitive radios that can sense weak and minute RF signals. 03:59The second thing: machine learning. So you keep hearing about machine learning and there was a revolution
of machine learning recently, in deep learning, and that allowed us to build
machine-learning models that can understand wireless signals
and interpret them so they would know what happened
in the environment. So if you think of it,
the radio is like the ear of our device and the machine learning
is like the brain, and together, they have
a very powerful device. 04:32So what else can we sense about people
using wireless signals? Sleep. Sleep, actually, is something
very dear to my heart, because my sleep is a disaster. 04:44(Laughter) 04:45So one thing is when you start working
on some physiological signal and you discover that yours sucks. 04:51(Laughter) 04:55So you can see why we can capture sleep, because the person walks and the device
sees him as he walks to bed, when he stops tossing around in bed, when he steps out of bed, and that measure of sleep
is what people call actigraphy. It's based on motion. But it turned out
that we can actually get sleep at a much more important level. We can understand
the change in the brain waves that occur during sleep. 05:23So, many of you probably know
that as we go to sleep, our brainwaves change
and we enter different stages: awake, light sleep, deep sleep
and REM, or rapid eye movement. These stages are of course
related to sleep disorders, but they are also related
to various diseases. So for example, disturbances in REM
are associated with depression. Disturbances in deep sleep
are associated with Alzheimer's. So if you want to get sleep staging, today, you will send the person
to the hospital, they put all of these
electrodes on their head, and they ask them to sleep like that. 06:01(Laughter) 06:04It's not really a happy experience. 06:08So what if I tell you
that I can do the same thing but without any of these electrodes
on the person's body? So here is our device, transmitting very low power
wireless signal, analyzes the reflections using AI and spits out the sleep stages
throughout the night. So we know, for example,
when this person is dreaming. Not just that ... we can even get your breathing
while you are sitting like that, and without touching you. So he is sitting and reading and this is his inhales, exhales. We asked him to hold his breath, and you see the signal
staying at a steady level because he exhaled. He did not inhale. And I want to zoom in on the signal. And this is the same signal as before. These are the inhales, these are the exhales. And you see these blips on the signal? These are not noise. They are his heartbeats. And you can see them beat by beat. 07:11So I want to stop here for a moment
and show you a live demo. Zach is going to help me with the demo, and we're going to use the device
to monitor Zach's breathing. So this white box
that you see here is the device, and Zach is turning it on ... and let's see whether he breathes well. So we're going to do exactly what we did
in the video with the other guy, so the wireless signal is going through, it's touching Zach's body, and it's reflecting back to the device, and we want to monitor his breathing,
his inhale-exhale motion. So we see the inhales, exhales -- so see, these ups and downs
are Zach breathing. Inhaling, exhaling. 08:00(Applause) 08:05So, he can breathe. 08:08(Laughter) 08:09Zach, can you hold your breath, please? 08:13OK, so now he's holding his breath, so you see the signal stays
at a steady level, and these are his heartbeats. Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat. 08:23(Applause) 08:24OK, Zach, you can breathe again. 08:26(Laughter) 08:28We don't want accidents here. 08:30(Laughter) 08:31OK, thank you. 08:33(Applause) 08:39So as you can see, we have this device that can monitor so many
physiological signals for you, and what is really interesting
about this device is that it does all this
without any wearables, without asking the person
to change his behavior or to wear anything
or charge anything special. And that got doctors very excited, because doctors, they always want to know
more information about their patients, particularly at home, and this is particularly true
in chronic diseases, like pulmonary diseases, like COPD, or heart failure or Alzheimer's
and even depression. All of these chronic diseases
are very important. In fact -- perhaps you know -- two-thirds of the cost
of health care in the US is due to chronic diseases. But what is really interesting
about chronic diseases is that when the person, for example, has a problem that leads
to the hospital and the emergency room, this problem doesn't happen overnight. Actually, things happen gradually. So if we can monitor
chronic disease patients in their home, we can detect changes in their breathing,
heartbeat, mobility, sleep -- and we can detect emergencies
before they occur and have the doctor intervene earlier so that we can avoid hospitalization. 09:58And indeed, today we are working
with multiple doctors in different disease categories. So I'm really excited because we have deployed the device
with many patients. We have deployed the device
with patients that have COPD, which is a pulmonary disease, patients that have Alzheimer's, patients that have depression and anxiety and people that have Parkinson's. And we are working with the doctors
on improving their life, understanding the disease better. 10:26So when I started, I told you that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars
and the Force in Star Wars, and indeed, I'm still
very much fascinated, even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars, waiting for the next movie. But I'm very fascinated now and excited about this new Force of wireless signals, and the potential of changing
health care with this new force. 10:55One of the patients with whom
we deployed is actually my aunt. She has heart failure, and I'm sure many of you guys
in the audience have parents, grandparents,
loved ones who have chronic diseases. So I want you to imagine with me a future where in every home
that has a chronic disease patient, there is a device like this device
sitting in the background and just monitoring passively sleep, breathing, the health
of this chronic disease patient, and before an emergency occurs, it would detect the degradation
in the physiological signal and alert the doctor so that we can avoid hospitalization. This can change health care
as we know it today, improve how we understand
chronic diseases and also save many lives. 11:42Thank you. 11:44(Applause) 11:49Helen Walters: Dina, thank you so much. Thank you too, Zach. So glad you're breathing. So Dina, this is amazing. The positive applications are incredible. What is the framework, though,
like the ethical framework around this? What are you doing to prevent
this technology from being used for other, perhaps less positive
types of applications? 12:10Dina Katabi: Yeah, this is
a very important question, of course, like, what about misuse, or what about, I guess you could say,
about the Dark Side of the Force? 12:18HW: Right, right. 12:19(Laughter) 12:21DK: So we actually have technologies that prevent people
from trying to use this device to monitor somebody without their consent. Because the device understands space, it will ask you to prove,
by doing certain movements, that you have access to the space and you are the person
who you are asking the device to monitor. So technology-wise, we have technology
that we integrate to prevent misuse, but also, I think there is a role
for policy, like everything else, and hopefully, with the two of them,
we can control any misuse. 12:57HW: Amazing. Thank you so much. 12:58DK: Thank you. 13:00(Applause)"
3,How we can teach computers to make sense of our emotions,Raphael Arar,Apr 2018,"How can we make AI that people actually want to interact with? Raphael Arar suggests we start by making art. He shares interactive projects that help AI explore complex ideas like nostalgia, intuition and conversation -- all working towards the goal of making our future technology just as much human as it is artificial.", (39K),"Transcript (19 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTürkçeРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسىગુજરાતીภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:01I consider myself one part artist
and one part designer. And I work at an artificial
intelligence research lab. We're trying to create technology that you'll want to interact with
in the far future. Not just six months from now,
but try years and decades from now. And we're taking a moonshot that we'll want to be
interacting with computers in deeply emotional ways. So in order to do that, the technology has to be
just as much human as it is artificial. It has to get you. You know, like that inside joke
that'll have you and your best friend on the floor, cracking up. Or that look of disappointment
that you can just smell from miles away. 00:48I view art as the gateway to help us
bridge this gap between human and machine: to figure out what it means
to get each other so that we can train AI to get us. 01:01See, to me, art is a way
to put tangible experiences to intangible ideas,
feelings and emotions. And I think it's one
of the most human things about us. See, we're a complicated
and complex bunch. We have what feels like
an infinite range of emotions, and to top it off, we're all different. We have different family backgrounds, different experiences
and different psychologies. And this is what makes life
really interesting. But this is also what makes
working on intelligent technology extremely difficult. And right now, AI research, well, it's a bit lopsided on the tech side. And that makes a lot of sense. 01:45See, for every
qualitative thing about us -- you know, those parts of us that are
emotional, dynamic and subjective -- we have to convert it
to a quantitative metric: something that can be represented
with facts, figures and computer code. The issue is, there are
many qualitative things that we just can't put our finger on. 02:08So, think about hearing
your favorite song for the first time. What were you doing? How did you feel? Did you get goosebumps? Or did you get fired up? Hard to describe, right? See, parts of us feel so simple, but under the surface,
there's really a ton of complexity. And translating
that complexity to machines is what makes them modern-day moonshots. And I'm not convinced that we can
answer these deeper questions with just ones and zeros alone. 02:45So, in the lab, I've been creating art as a way to help me
design better experiences for bleeding-edge technology. And it's been serving as a catalyst to beef up the more human ways
that computers can relate to us. Through art, we're tacking
some of the hardest questions, like what does it really mean to feel? Or how do we engage and know
how to be present with each other? And how does intuition
affect the way that we interact? 03:14So, take for example human emotion. Right now, computers can make sense
of our most basic ones, like joy, sadness,
anger, fear and disgust, by converting those
characteristics to math. But what about the more complex emotions? You know, those emotions that we have a hard time
describing to each other? Like nostalgia. 03:35So, to explore this, I created
a piece of art, an experience, that asked people to share a memory, and I teamed up with some data scientists to figure out how to take
an emotion that's so highly subjective and convert it into something
mathematically precise. So, we created what we call
a nostalgia score and it's the heart of this installation. To do that, the installation
asks you to share a story, the computer then analyzes it
for its simpler emotions, it checks for your tendency
to use past-tense wording and also looks for words
that we tend to associate with nostalgia, like ""home,"" ""childhood"" and ""the past."" It then creates a nostalgia score to indicate how nostalgic your story is. And that score is the driving force
behind these light-based sculptures that serve as physical embodiments
of your contribution. And the higher the score,
the rosier the hue. You know, like looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses. 04:32So, when you see your score and the physical representation of it, sometimes you'd agree
and sometimes you wouldn't. It's as if it really understood
how that experience made you feel. But other times it gets tripped up and has you thinking
it doesn't understand you at all. But the piece really serves to show that if we have a hard time explaining
the emotions that we have to each other, how can we teach a computer
to make sense of them? 05:00So, even the more objective parts
about being human are hard to describe. Like, conversation. Have you ever really tried
to break down the steps? So think about sitting
with your friend at a coffee shop and just having small talk. How do you know when to take a turn? How do you know when to shift topics? And how do you even know
what topics to discuss? See, most of us
don't really think about it, because it's almost second nature. And when we get to know someone,
we learn more about what makes them tick, and then we learn
what topics we can discuss. But when it comes to teaching
AI systems how to interact with people, we have to teach them
step by step what to do. And right now, it feels clunky. If you've ever tried to talk
with Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant, you can tell that it or they
can still sound cold. And have you ever gotten annoyed when they didn't understand
what you were saying and you had to rephrase what you wanted
20 times just to play a song? Alright, to the credit of the designers,
realistic communication is really hard. And there's a whole branch of sociology, called conversation analysis, that tries to make blueprints
for different types of conversation. Types like customer service
or counseling, teaching and others. 06:16I've been collaborating
with a conversation analyst at the lab to try to help our AI systems
hold more human-sounding conversations. This way, when you have an interaction
with a chatbot on your phone or a voice-based system in the car, it sounds a little more human
and less cold and disjointed. So I created a piece of art that tries to highlight
the robotic, clunky interaction to help us understand, as designers, why it doesn't sound human yet
and, well, what we can do about it. The piece is called Bot to Bot and it puts one conversational
system against another and then exposes it to the general public. And what ends up happening
is that you get something that tries to mimic human conversation, but falls short. Sometimes it works and sometimes
it gets into these, well, loops of misunderstanding. So even though the machine-to-machine
conversation can make sense, grammatically and colloquially, it can still end up
feeling cold and robotic. And despite checking all the boxes,
the dialogue lacks soul and those one-off quirks
that make each of us who we are. 07:18So while it might be grammatically correct and uses all the right
hashtags and emojis, it can end up sounding mechanical
and, well, a little creepy. And we call this the uncanny valley. You know, that creepiness factor of tech where it's close to human
but just slightly off. And the piece will start being one way that we test
for the humanness of a conversation and the parts that get
lost in translation. 07:42So there are other things
that get lost in translation, too, like human intuition. Right now, computers
are gaining more autonomy. They can take care of things for us, like change the temperature
of our houses based on our preferences and even help us drive on the freeway. 07:57But there are things
that you and I do in person that are really difficult
to translate to AI. So think about the last time
that you saw an old classmate or coworker. Did you give them a hug
or go in for a handshake? You probably didn't think twice because you've had so many
built up experiences that had you do one or the other. 08:19And as an artist, I feel
that access to one's intuition, your unconscious knowing, is what helps us create amazing things. Big ideas, from that abstract,
nonlinear place in our consciousness that is the culmination
of all of our experiences. And if we want computers to relate to us
and help amplify our creative abilities, I feel that we'll need to start thinking
about how to make computers be intuitive. 08:44So I wanted to explore
how something like human intuition could be directly translated
to artificial intelligence. And I created a piece
that explores computer-based intuition in a physical space. The piece is called Wayfinding, and it's set up as a symbolic compass
that has four kinetic sculptures. Each one represents a direction, north, east, south and west. And there are sensors set up
on the top of each sculpture that capture how far away
you are from them. And the data that gets collected ends up changing the way
that sculptures move and the direction of the compass. The thing is, the piece doesn't work
like the automatic door sensor that just opens
when you walk in front of it. See, your contribution is only a part
of its collection of lived experiences. And all of those experiences
affect the way that it moves. So when you walk in front of it, it starts to use all of the data that it's captured
throughout its exhibition history -- or its intuition -- to mechanically respond to you
based on what it's learned from others. And what ends up happening
is that as participants we start to learn the level
of detail that we need in order to manage expectations from both humans and machines. We can almost see our intuition
being played out on the computer, picturing all of that data
being processed in our mind's eye. 10:05My hope is that this type of art will help us think differently
about intuition and how to apply that to AI in the future. 10:12So these are just a few examples
of how I'm using art to feed into my work as a designer and researcher
of artificial intelligence. And I see it as a crucial way
to move innovation forward. Because right now, there are
a lot of extremes when it comes to AI. Popular movies show it
as this destructive force while commercials
are showing it as a savior to solve some of the world's
most complex problems. 10:36But regardless of where you stand, it's hard to deny
that we're living in a world that's becoming more
and more digital by the second. Our lives revolve around our devices,
smart appliances and more. And I don't think
this will let up any time soon. So, I'm trying to embed
more humanness from the start. And I have a hunch that bringing art
into an AI research process is a way to do just that. 11:03Thank you. 11:04(Applause)"

to become less bureaucratic, to have fewer central rules
and procedures, more autonomy for their local
teams to be more agile. And now they are pushing
artificial intelligence, AI, unaware that cool technology might make them
more bureaucratic than ever. Why? Because AI operates
just like bureaucracies. 00:32The essence of bureaucracy is to favor rules and procedures
over human judgment. And AI decides solely based on rules. Many rules inferred from past data but only rules. And if human judgment
is not kept in the loop, AI will bring a terrifying form
of new bureaucracy -- I call it ""algocracy"" -- where AI will take more and more
critical decisions by the rules outside of any human control. Is there a real risk? Yes. 01:11I'm leading a team of 800 AI specialists. We have deployed
over 100 customized AI solutions for large companies around the world. And I see too many corporate executives
behaving like bureaucrats from the past. They want to take costly,
old-fashioned humans out of the loop and rely only upon AI to take decisions. I call this the ""human-zero mindset."" And why is it so tempting? Because the other route,
""Human plus AI,"" is long, costly and difficult. Business teams, tech teams,
data-science teams have to iterate for months to craft exactly how humans and AI
can best work together. Long, costly and difficult. But the reward is huge. 02:10A recent survey from BCG and MIT shows that 18 percent
of companies in the world are pioneering AI, making money with it. Those companies focus 80 percent
of their AI initiatives on effectiveness and growth, taking better decisions -- not replacing humans with AI
to save costs. 02:38Why is it important
to keep humans in the loop? Simply because, left alone,
AI can do very dumb things. Sometimes with no consequences,
like in this tweet. ""Dear Amazon, I bought a toilet seat. Necessity, not desire. I do not collect them, I'm not a toilet-seat addict. No matter how temptingly you email me, I am not going to think, 'Oh, go on, then, one more toilet seat,
I'll treat myself.' "" 03:06(Laughter) 03:07Sometimes, with more consequence,
like in this other tweet. ""Had the same situation with my mother's burial urn."" 03:17(Laughter) 03:18""For months after her death, I got messages from Amazon,
saying, 'If you liked that ...' "" 03:23(Laughter) 03:25Sometimes with worse consequences. Take an AI engine rejecting
a student application for university. Why? Because it has ""learned,"" on past data, characteristics of students
that will pass and fail. Some are obvious, like GPAs. But if, in the past, all students
from a given postal code have failed, it is very likely
that AI will make this a rule and will reject every student
with this postal code, not giving anyone the opportunity
to prove the rule wrong. 03:59And no one can check all the rules, because advanced AI
is constantly learning. And if humans are kept out of the room, there comes the algocratic nightmare. Who is accountable
for rejecting the student? No one, AI did. Is it fair? Yes. The same set of objective rules
has been applied to everyone. Could we reconsider for this bright kid
with the wrong postal code? No, algos don't change their mind. 04:30We have a choice here. Carry on with algocracy or decide to go to ""Human plus AI."" And to do this, we need to stop thinking tech first, and we need to start applying
the secret formula. To deploy ""Human plus AI,"" 10 percent of the effort is to code algos; 20 percent to build tech
around the algos, collecting data, building UI,
integrating into legacy systems; But 70 percent, the bulk of the effort, is about weaving together AI
with people and processes to maximize real outcome. 05:12AI fails when cutting short
on the 70 percent. The price tag for that can be small, wasting many, many millions
of dollars on useless technology. Anyone cares? Or real tragedies: 346 casualties in the recent crashes
of two B-737 aircrafts when pilots could not interact properly with a computerized command system. 05:43For a successful 70 percent, the first step is to make sure
that algos are coded by data scientists and domain experts together. Take health care for example. One of our teams worked on a new drug
with a slight problem. When taking their first dose, some patients, very few,
have heart attacks. So, all patients,
when taking their first dose, have to spend one day in hospital, for monitoring, just in case. Our objective was to identify patients
who were at zero risk of heart attacks, who could skip the day in hospital. We used AI to analyze data
from clinical trials, to correlate ECG signal,
blood composition, biomarkers, with the risk of heart attack. In one month, our model could flag 62 percent
of patients at zero risk. They could skip the day in hospital. Would you be comfortable
staying at home for your first dose if the algo said so? 06:50(Laughter) 06:51Doctors were not. What if we had false negatives, meaning people who are told by AI
they can stay at home, and die? 07:01(Laughter) 07:02There started our 70 percent. We worked with a team of doctors to check the medical logic
of each variable in our model. For instance, we were using
the concentration of a liver enzyme as a predictor, for which the medical logic
was not obvious. The statistical signal was quite strong. But what if it was a bias in our sample? That predictor was taken out of the model. We also took out predictors
for which experts told us they cannot be rigorously measured
by doctors in real life. After four months, we had a model and a medical protocol. They both got approved my medical authorities
in the US last spring, resulting in far less stress
for half of the patients and better quality of life. And an expected upside on sales
over 100 million for that drug. 07:59Seventy percent weaving AI
with team and processes also means building powerful interfaces for humans and AI to solve
the most difficult problems together. Once, we got challenged
by a fashion retailer. ""We have the best buyers in the world. Could you build an AI engine
that would beat them at forecasting sales? At telling how many high-end,
light-green, men XL shirts we need to buy for next year? At predicting better what will sell or not than our designers."" Our team trained a model in a few weeks,
on past sales data, and the competition was organized
with human buyers. Result? AI wins, reducing forecasting
errors by 25 percent. Human-zero champions could have tried
to implement this initial model and create a fight with all human buyers. Have fun. But we knew that human buyers
had insights on fashion trends that could not be found in past data. 09:11There started our 70 percent. We went for a second test, where human buyers
were reviewing quantities suggested by AI and could correct them if needed. Result? Humans using AI ... lose. Seventy-five percent
of the corrections made by a human were reducing accuracy. 09:37Was it time to get rid of human buyers? No. It was time to recreate a model where humans would not try
to guess when AI is wrong, but where AI would take real input
from human buyers. We fully rebuilt the model and went away from our initial interface,
which was, more or less, ""Hey, human! This is what I forecast, correct whatever you want,"" and moved to a much richer one, more like, ""Hey, humans! I don't know the trends for next year. Could you share with me
your top creative bets?"" ""Hey, humans! Could you help me quantify
those few big items? I cannot find any good comparables
in the past for them."" Result? ""Human plus AI"" wins, reducing forecast errors by 50 percent. It took one year to finalize the tool. Long, costly and difficult. But profits and benefits were in excess of 100 million of savings
per year for that retailer. 10:51Seventy percent on very sensitive topics also means human have to decide
what is right or wrong and define rules
for what AI can do or not, like setting caps on prices
to prevent pricing engines [from charging] outrageously high prices
to uneducated customers who would accept them. Only humans can define those boundaries -- there is no way AI
can find them in past data. 11:19Some situations are in the gray zone. We worked with a health insurer. He developed an AI engine
to identify, among his clients, people who are just about
to go to hospital to sell them premium services. And the problem is, some prospects were called
by the commercial team while they did not know yet they would have to go
to hospital very soon. You are the CEO of this company. Do you stop that program? Not an easy question. 11:52And to tackle this question,
some companies are building teams, defining ethical rules and standards
to help business and tech teams set limits between personalization and manipulation, customization of offers
and discrimination, targeting and intrusion. 12:12I am convinced that in every company, applying AI where it really matters
has massive payback. Business leaders need to be bold and select a few topics, and for each of them, mobilize
10, 20, 30 people from their best teams -- tech, AI, data science, ethics -- and go through the full
10-, 20-, 70-percent cycle of ""Human plus AI,"" if they want to land AI effectively
in their teams and processes. There is no other way. 12:46footnotefootnoteCitizens in developed economies
already fear algocracy. Seven thousand were interviewed
in a recent survey. More than 75 percent
expressed real concerns on the impact of AI
on the workforce, on privacy, on the risk of a dehumanized society. Pushing algocracy creates a real risk
of severe backlash against AI within companies or in society at large. ""Human plus AI"" is our only option to bring the benefits of AI
to the real world. And in the end, winning organizations
will invest in human knowledge, not just AI and data. Recruiting, training,
rewarding human experts. Data is said to be the new oil, but believe me, human knowledge
will make the difference, because it is the only derrick available to pump the oil hidden in the data. 13:52Thank you. 13:53(Applause)"
3,The human skills we need in an unpredictable world,Margaret Heffernan,Aug 2019,"The more we rely on technology to make us efficient, the fewer skills we have to confront the unexpected, says writer and entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan. She shares why we need less tech and more messy human skills -- imagination, humility, bravery -- to solve problems in business, government and life in an unpredictable age. ""We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before,"" she says. ""We can make any future we choose.""", (117K),"Transcript (24 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दीગુજરાતી中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Recently, the leadership team
of an American supermarket chain decided that their business
needed to get a lot more efficient. So they embraced their digital
transformation with zeal. Out went the teams
supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator. Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in,
got assigned a task, did it, came back for more. This was scientific
management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work. It was super efficient. 00:38Well, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going
to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid
was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed
to bring in coconuts the next day. 00:55(Laughter) 00:56Efficiency works really well when you can predict
exactly what you're going to need. But when the anomalous
or unexpected comes along -- kids, customers, coconuts -- well, then efficiency
is no longer your friend. 01:12This has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected
is becoming the norm. It's why experts and forecasters
are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out. Why? Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone
from being complicated to being complex -- which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat
themselves regularly. It means that very small changes
can make a disproportionate impact. And it means that expertise
won't always suffice, because the system
just keeps changing too fast. 01:56So what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now. It's why the Bank of England will say
yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when. We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict
where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories
are going to flood. It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws
and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs
and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty. In an environment that defies
so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes
our capacity to adapt and respond. 03:04So if efficiency is no longer
our guiding principle, how should we address the future? What kind of thinking
is really going to help us? What sort of talents
must we be sure to defend? I think that, where in the past we used to
think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking
about just in case, preparing for events
that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous. 03:33One example of this is the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI. We know there will be
more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what. So we can't plan. But we can prepare. So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines
for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict
which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out. So some of those vaccines
will never be used. That's inefficient. But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend
on a single technological solution. Epidemic responsiveness
also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other. But those relationships
take time to develop, time that is always in short supply
when an epidemic breaks out. So CEPI is developing relationships,
friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those
may never be used. That's inefficient,
a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust. 04:47You can see robust thinking
in financial services, too. In the past, banks used to hold
much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital,
being too efficient with it, is what made the banks
so fragile in the first place. Now, holding more capital
looks and is inefficient. But it's robust, because it protects
the financial system against surprises. 05:17Countries that are really serious
about climate change know that they have to adopt
multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one. The countries that are most advanced
have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply
and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time
they have certain prediction, that information may very well
come too late. 05:45You can take the same approach
to trade wars, and many countries do. Instead of depending on a single
huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might
suddenly become unstable. It's time-consuming and expensive,
negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy
better defended against shocks. It's particularly a strategy
adopted by small countries that know they'll never have
the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have
too many friends. But if you're stuck
in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured
by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it? Try some experiments. 06:38In the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run
pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday,
seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday. The nurses hated it. So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment. Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know
exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it
to the nurses to decide? 07:09Sound reckless? 07:10(Laughter) 07:12(Applause) 07:14In his experiment, Jos found
the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent. When I asked Jos what had surprised him
about his experiment, he just kind of laughed and he said, ""Well, I had no idea it could be so easy to find such a huge improvement, because this isn't the kind of thing
you can know or predict sitting at a desk
or staring at a computer screen."" So now this form of nursing
has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world. But in every new country
it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly
and unpredictably different. 07:59Of course, not all experiments work. Jos tried a similar approach
to the fire service and found it didn't work because
the service is just too centralized. Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way
you can figure out how the real world works. So now he's trying teachers. Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery. 08:29In England -- I was about to say in the UK,
but in England -- 08:34(Laughter) 08:36(Applause) 08:41In England, the leading rugby team,
or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens. The manager and the coach there realized
that all the physical training they do and the data-driven
conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams
do exactly the same thing. So they risked an experiment. They took the whole team away,
even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago. This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players
on a ski slope, right? 09:20(Laughter) 09:21But what they found was that
the players came back with renewed bonds
of loyalty and solidarity. And now when they're on the pitch
under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager
calls ""poise"" -- an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other. Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall
to efficiency to try it. 09:53At a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about
everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything
that made any difference to the company's productivity. So she devised an experiment
that she calls ""Love Week"": a whole week where each employee
has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it. It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting. But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company
more productive. 10:32Preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery -- in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources
of resilience and strength. They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention. And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need
these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills. 11:15But in our growing
dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills. Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine
what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off. The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves. The more -- 11:54(Applause) 11:59The more time doctors spend
staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend
looking at their patients. The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids. The more time we spend with people that
we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people
who are different from ourselves. And the less compassion we need,
the less compassion we have. 12:29What all of these
technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model
of a predictable reality onto a world that is
infinitely surprising. What gets left out? Anything that can't be measured -- which is just about
everything that counts. 12:53(Applause) 13:02Our growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled, more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world. 13:17Now, as I was thinking about
the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to
a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone
through existential crises, when they teetered
on the brink of collapse. These were frank,
gut-wrenching conversations. Many men wept just remembering. So I asked them: ""What kept you going through this?"" 13:53And they all had exactly the same answer. ""It wasn't data or technology,"" they said. ""It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going."" 14:05One added, ""It was pretty much
the opposite of the gig economy."" 14:12But then I went and I talked to a group
of young, rising executives, and I asked them, ""Who are your friends at work?"" And they just looked blank. 14:21""There's no time."" 14:23""They're too busy."" 14:25""It's not efficient."" 14:27Who, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come? 14:39Anyone who tries to tell you
that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny. The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there. 14:58But that's OK, because we have so much imagination -- if we use it. We have deep talents
of inventiveness and exploration -- if we apply them. We are brave enough to invent things
we've never seen before. Lose those skills, and we are adrift. But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose. 15:32Thank you. 15:33(Applause)"

So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech. 00:50(Laughter) 00:52So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent. The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. 01:33(Laughter) 01:35It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section -- you have red/green paddles. If you like what's going on, show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. (Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing -- I hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions. Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin. 02:50Data: Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here. 02:54(Laughter) 02:56(Applause) 03:03You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes? 03:08Audience: Yeah. 03:10Data: Here's the first one. Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, ""I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."" ""That's terrible,"" said the patient. ""How can the news possibly be worse?"" ""I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."" 03:33(Laughter) 03:35(Applause) 03:37The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss. Data: Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? ""Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon."" 03:56(Laughter) 03:58HK: He's a French robot. 04:00Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He gasps to the operator, ""My friend is dead. What can I do?"" The operator says, ""Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead."" There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line, ""Okay, now what?"" 04:34(Laughter) 04:36(Applause) 04:38Question: Why is television called a medium? Anyone? Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television. Any of you like television? Audience: Yes. Data: I find it incredibly educational. Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read. (Laughter) That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time? 05:09(Applause) 05:18You've been a great audience. Thank you. 05:22HK: Yay. 05:24(Applause) 05:28So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come. And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. 05:40Thank you very much. 05:42(Applause)"

many things that I can't do because I cannot see. That's largely true. Actually, I just needed
to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. 00:20But there is also a lot that I can do. This is me rock climbing
for the first time. Actually, I love sports
and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating,
scuba diving, running and so on. But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me. I want to be independent. 00:45I lost my sight at the age of 14
in a swimming pool accident. I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind. The hardest thing for me
was losing my independence. Things that until then seemed simple
became almost impossible to do alone. For example, one of my
challenges was textbooks. Back then, there were no
personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones. So I had to ask one of my two brothers
to read me textbooks, and I had to create
my own books in Braille. Can you imagine? Of course, my brothers
were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there
whenever I needed them. (Laughter) I think they tried to stay away from me. I don't blame them. I really wanted to be freed
from relying on someone. That became my strong desire
to ignite innovation. 01:52Jump ahead to the mid-1980s. I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille? These amazing technologies
must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. That's the moment
my innovation journey began. 02:18footnotefootnoteI started developing
digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor,
digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. Today, every student who is visually
impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers
and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice. This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books
in their tablets in 2015. But Braille went digital
many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s,
almost 30 years ago. Strong and specific needs
of the blind people made this opportunity to create
digital books way back then. And this is actually not
the first time this happened, because history shows us
accessibility ignites innovation. The telephone was invented
while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. Some keyboards were also invented
to help people with disabilities. 03:36footnotefootnoteNow I'm going to give you
another example from my own life. In the '90s, people around me
started talking about the Internet and web browsing. I remember the first time
I went on the web. I was astonished. I could access newspapers
at any time and every day. I could even search
for any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blind
people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web
into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified
the user interface. 04:16This led me to develop
the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later,
translated into 11 languages. When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users. One that I strongly remember said, ""For me, the Internet
is a small window to the world."" 04:43It was a revolutionary moment
for the blind. The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created
for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined. It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen
to a recipe while cooking. 05:06Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough. For example, when I approached
the stage just now, I needed assistance. My goal is to come up here independently. And not just here. My goal is to be able to travel
and do things that are simple to you. 05:30OK, now let me show you
the latest technologies. This is a smartphone app
that we are working on. 05:38(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet
to the door, and keep straight. 05:45EV: Take the two doors to go out.
The door is on your right. 05:55EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick! 05:58(Laughter) CA: Where are you going?
You look so happy. 06:02Nick: Oh -- well, my paper
just got accepted. CA: That's great! Congratulations. 06:05Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know
it was me, and that I look happy? (Chieko and Nick laugh) 06:10Man: Hi. (Laughter) CA: Oh ... hi. 06:15EV: He is not talking to you,
but on his phone. 06:24EV: Potato chips. 06:33EV: Dark chocolate with almonds. 06:36EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday;
take apple instead of chocolate. 06:39(Laughter) 06:42EV: Approaching. 06:48EV: You arrived. 06:50CA: Now ... 06:52(Applause) 06:56Thank you. 06:57So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals
and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around
indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. But the computer vision part
that showed who is approaching, in which mood -- we are still
working on that part. And recognizing facial expressions
is very important for me to be social. 07:27So now the fusions of technologies
are ready to help me see the real world. We call this cognitive assistance. It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice
or sends a vibration to my fingers. Cognitive assistance will augment
missing or weakened abilities -- in other words, our five senses. This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find
a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant
while walking along a street. It will be amazing if I can find you
on the street before you notice me. It will become my best buddy, and yours. 08:24So, this really is a great challenge. It is a challenge
that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating
an open community to accelerate research activities. Just this morning, we announced
the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. 08:46The frontier is the real world. The blind community is exploring
this technical frontier and the pathfinder. I hope to work with you
to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself. 09:09Thank you so much. 09:10(Applause)"

off the coast of the Bahamas. I'd actually never swum
in the ocean before, so it was a bit terrifying. What I remember the most is,
as I put my head in the water and I was trying really hard
to breathe through the snorkel, this huge group
of striped yellow and black fish came straight at me ... and I just froze. And then, as if it had
suddenly changed its mind, came towards me
and then swerved to the right and went right around me. It was absolutely mesmerizing. Maybe many of you
have had this experience. Of course, there's the color
and the beauty of it, but there was also
just the sheer oneness of it, as if it wasn't hundreds of fish but a single entity
with a single collective mind that was making decisions. When I look back, I think that experience
really ended up determining what I've worked on for most of my career. 01:04I'm a computer scientist, and the field that I work in
is artificial intelligence. And a key theme in AI is being able to understand intelligence
by creating our own computational systems that display intelligence
the way we see it in nature. Now, most popular views of AI, of course,
come from science fiction and the movies, and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan. But that tends to be a very human-centric
view of intelligence. When you think of a fish school, or when I think of a flock of starlings, that feels like a really different
kind of intelligence. For starters, any one fish is just so tiny compared to the sheer size
of the collective, so it seems that any one individual would have a really limited
and myopic view of what's going on, and intelligence
isn't really about the individual but somehow a property
of the group itself. 02:00Secondly, and the thing
that I still find most remarkable, is that we know that there are no leaders
supervising this fish school. Instead, this incredible
collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the interactions
of one fish and another. Somehow, there are these interactions
or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make it all work out. 02:25So the question for AI then becomes, what are those rules of engagement
that lead to this kind of intelligence, and of course, can we create our own? 02:34And that's the primary thing
that I work on with my team in my lab. We work on it through theory, looking at abstract rule systems and thinking about
the mathematics behind it. We also do it through biology,
working closely with experimentalists. But mostly, we do it through robotics, where we try to create
our own collective systems that can do the kinds of things
that we see in nature, or at least try to. 03:01One of our first robotic quests
along this line was to create our very own colony
of a thousand robots. So very simple robots, but they could be programmed
to exhibit collective intelligence, and that's what we were able to do. So this is what a single robot looks like. It's quite small,
about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly
communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them. And so now we can start to program
exactly an interaction, a rule of engagement between neighbors. And once we have this system, we can start to program many
different kinds of rules of engagement that you would see in nature. 03:41So for example,
spontaneous synchronization, how audiences are clapping
and suddenly start all clapping together, the fireflies flashing together. We can program rules
for pattern formation, how cells in a tissue determine what role
they're going to take on and set the patterns of our bodies. We can program rules for migration, and in this way, we're really learning
from nature's rules. 04:10But we can also take it a step further. We can actually take these rules
that we've learned from nature and combine them and create
entirely new collective behaviors of our very own. 04:21So for example, imagine that you had
two different kinds of rules. So your first rule is a motion rule where a moving robot can move
around other stationary robots. And your second rule is a pattern rule where a robot takes on a color
based on its two nearest neighbors. So if I start with a blob of robots
in a little pattern seed, it turns out that these two rules
are sufficient for the group to be able to self-assemble
a simple line pattern. And if I have more
complicated pattern rules, and I design error correction rules, we can actually create really,
really complicated self assemblies, and here's what that looks like. 04:59So here, you're going to see
a thousand robots that are working together
to self-assemble the letter K. The K is on its side. And the important thing
is that no one is in charge. So any single robot is only talking
to a small number of robots nearby it, and it's using its motion rule
to move around the half-built structure just looking for a place to fit in
based on its pattern rules. And even though no robot
is doing anything perfectly, the rules are such that we can get
the collective to do its goal robustly together. And the illusion becomes
almost so perfect, you know -- you just start to not even notice
that they're individual robots at all, and it becomes a single entity, kind of like the school of fish. 05:48So these are robots and rules
in two dimensions, but we can also think about robots
and rules in three dimensions. So what if we could create robots
that could build together? And here, we can take inspiration
from social insects. So if you think about
mound-building termites or you think about army ants, they create incredible,
complex nest structures out of mud and even out of their own bodies. And like the system I showed you before, these insects actually
also have pattern rules that help them determine what to build, but the pattern can be made
out of other insects, or it could be made out of mud. And we can use that same idea
to create rules for robots. 06:32So here, you're going to see
some simulated robots. So the simulated robot has a motion rule, which is how it traverses
through the structure, looking for a place to fit in, and it has pattern rules
where it looks at groups of blocks to decide whether to place a block. And with the right motion rules
and the right pattern rules, we can actually get the robots
to build whatever we want. And of course, everybody wants
their own tower. 06:59(Laughter) 07:02So once we have these rules, we can start to create the robot bodies
that go with these rules. So here, you see a robot
that can climb over blocks, but it can also lift and move these blocks and it can start to edit
the very structure that it's on. But with these rules, this is really only one kind of robot body
that you could imagine. You could imagine
many different kinds of robot bodies. So if you think about robots
that maybe could move sandbags and could help build levees, or we could think of robots
that built out of soft materials and worked together
to shore up a collapsed building -- so just the same kind of rules
in different kinds of bodies. Or if, like my group, you are completely
obsessed with army ants, then maybe one day we can make robots
that can climb over literally anything including other members of their tribe, and self-assemble things
out of their own bodies. Once you understand the rules, just many different kinds
of robot visions become possible. 08:06And coming back to the snorkeling trip, we actually understand a great deal
about the rules that fish schools use. So if we can invent
the bodies to go with that, then maybe there is a future where I and my group will get to snorkel
with a fish school of our own creation. 08:28Each of these systems that I showed you brings us closer to having
the mathematical and the conceptual tools to create our own versions
of collective power, and this can enable many different kinds
of future applications, whether you think about robots
that build flood barriers or you think about robotic bee colonies
that could pollinate crops or underwater schools of robots
that monitor coral reefs, or if we reach for the stars
and we thinking about programming constellations of satellites. In each of these systems, being able to understand
how to design the rules of engagement and being able to create
good collective behavior becomes a key to realizing these visions. 09:10So, so far I've talked about
rules for insects and for fish and for robots, but what about the rules that apply
to our own human collective? And the last thought
that I'd like to leave you with is that science is of course itself an incredible manifestation
of collective intelligence, but unlike the beautiful
fish schools that I study, I feel we still have a much longer
evolutionary path to walk. So in addition to working on improving
the science of robot collectives, I also work on creating robots
and thinking about rules that will improve
our own scientific collective. There's this saying that I love: who does science
determines what science gets done. Imagine a society where we had rules of engagement where every child grew up believing
that they could stand here and be a technologist of the future, or where every adult believed that they had the ability
not just to understand but to change how science and technology
impacts their everyday lives. What would that society look like? I believe that we can do that. I believe that we can choose our rules, and we engineer not just robots but we can engineer
our own human collective, and if we do and when we do,
it will be beautiful. 10:30Thank you. 10:31(Applause)"

work on his most ingenious invention yet. He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with 
superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, 
the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything 
Hephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: 
the first robot. 00:49Three times a day, the bronze guardian 
marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships 
approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders 
into their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot 
and crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties 
day after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims 
could scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship 
of invaders that would test his mettle. 01:24The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, 
and the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest 
to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken 
many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate 
to rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable
bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, 
Talos spotted them. 01:49While the Argonauts cowered at the 
approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting 
bolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could 
make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep 
within his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for 
eternal life, Talos agreed. 02:18While Medea muttered incantations, 
Jason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a 
weak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, 
draining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with 
a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free 
to travel home. 02:40This story, first recorded in 
roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties 
about artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient 
blueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient 
robots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making 
actual automatons including robotic servants and 
flying models of birds. 03:05None of these creations were 
as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase 
paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate 
the uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about 
artificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic 
heart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a 
vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying 
automaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek."
3,6 big ethical questions about the future of AI,Genevieve Bell,Dec 2020,"Artificial intelligence is all around us ... and the future will only bring more of it. How can we ensure the AI systems we build are responsible, safe and sustainable? Ethical AI expert Genevieve Bell shares six framing questions to broaden our understanding of future technology -- and create the next generation of critical thinkers and doers.", (58K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishEspañolPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalالعربيةFootnotesFootnotes00:01Let me tell you a story
about artificial intelligence. There's a building in Sydney
at 1 Bligh Street. It houses lots of government apartments and busy people. From the outside, it looks like something
out of American science fiction: all gleaming glass and curved lines, and a piece of orange sculpture. On the inside, it has excellent coffee
on the ground floor and my favorite lifts in Sydney. They're beautiful; they look almost alive. And it turns out
I'm fascinated with lifts. For lots of reasons. But because lifts are one of the places
you can see the future. 00:34In the 21st century, lifts are interesting because they're one of the first places
that AI will touch you without you even knowing it happened. In many buildings all around the world, the lifts are running a set of algorithms. A form of protoartificial intelligence. That means before you even
walk up to the lift to press the button, it's anticipated you being there. It's already rearranging
all the carriages. Always going down, to save energy, and to know where
the traffic is going to be. By the time you've actually
pressed the button, you're already part of an entire system that's making sense of people
and the environment and the building and the built world. 01:13I know when we talk about AI,
we often talk about a world of robots. It's easy for our imaginations
to be occupied with science fiction, well, over the last 100 years. I say AI and you think ""The Terminator."" Somewhere, for us, making the connection
between AI and the built world, that's a harder story to tell. But the reality is AI is already
everywhere around us. And in many places. It's in buildings and in systems. More than 200 years of industrialization suggest that AI will find its way
to systems-level scale relatively easily. After all, one telling of that history suggests that all you have to do
is find a technology, achieve scale and revolution will follow. 01:55The story of mechanization,
automation and digitization all point to the role of technology
and its importance. Those stories of technological
transformation make scale seem, well, normal. Or expected. And stable. And sometimes even predictable. But it also puts the focus squarely
on technology and technology change. But I believe that scaling a technology
and building a system requires something more. 02:26We founded the 3Ai Institute
at the Australian National University in September 2017. It has one deceptively simple mission: to establish a new branch of engineering to take AI safely, sustainably
and responsibly to scale. But how do you build a new branch
of engineering in the 21st century? Well, we're teaching it into existence through an experimental education program. We're researching it into existence with locations as diverse
as Shakespeare's birthplace, the Great Barrier Reef, not to mention one of Australia's
largest autonomous mines. And we're theorizing it into existence, paying attention to the complexities
of cybernetic systems. We're working to build something new
and something useful. Something to create the next generation
of critical thinkers and critical doers. And we're doing all of that through a richer understanding
of AI's many pasts and many stories. And by working collaboratively
and collectively through teaching and research
and engagement, and by focusing as much
on the framing of the questions as the solving of the problems. 03:31We're not making a single AI, we're making the possibilities for many. And we're actively working
to decolonize our imaginations and to build a curriculum and a pedagogy that leaves room for a range of different
conversations and possibilities. We are making and remaking. And I know we're always
a work in progress. But here's a little glimpse into how we're approaching
that problem of scaling a future. 03:57We start by making sure
we're grounded in our own history. In December of 2018, I took myself up to the town of Brewarrina on the New South Wales-Queensland border. This place was a meeting place
for Aboriginal people, for different groups, to gather, have ceremonies,
meet, to be together. There, on the Barwon River,
there's a set of fish weirs that are one of the oldest
and largest systems of Aboriginal fish traps in Australia. This system is comprised
of 1.8 kilometers of stone walls shaped like a series of fishnets with the ""Us"" pointing down the river, allowing fish to be trapped
at different heights of the water. They're also fish holding pens
with different-height walls for storage, designed to change the way the water moves and to be able to store
big fish and little fish and to keep those fish
in cool, clear running water. This fish-trap system was a way to ensure
that you could feed people as they gathered there in a place
that was both a meeting of rivers and a meeting of cultures. 04:52footnotefootnoteIt isn't about the rocks
or even the traps per se. It is about the system
that those traps created. One that involves technical knowledge, cultural knowledge and ecological knowledge. This system is old. Some archaeologists
think it's as old as 40,000 years. The last time we have its recorded uses
is in the nineteen teens. It's had remarkable longevity
and incredible scale. And it's an inspiration to me. And a photo of the weir
is on our walls here at the Institute, to remind us of the promise
and the challenge of building something meaningful. And to remind us
that we're building systems in a place where people have built systems and sustained those same systems
for generations. 05:34It isn't just our history, it's our legacy as we seek to establish
a new branch of engineering. To build on that legacy
and our sense of purpose, I think we need a clear framework
for asking questions about the future. Questions for which there aren't
ready or easy answers. Here, the point is the asking
of the questions. We believe you need to go
beyond the traditional approach of problem-solving, to the more complicated one
of question asking and question framing. Because in so doing, you open up
all kinds of new possibilities and new challenges. 06:08For me, right now, there are six big questions
that frame our approach for taking AI safely, sustainably
and responsibly to scale. Questions about autonomy, agency, assurance, indicators, interfaces and intentionality. 06:24The first question we ask is a simple one. Is the system autonomous? Think back to that lift on Bligh Street. The reality is, one day,
that lift may be autonomous. Which is to say it will be able
to act without being told to act. But it isn't fully autonomous, right? It can't leave that Bligh Street building and wonder down
to Circular Quay for a beer. It goes up and down, that's all. But it does it by itself. It's autonomous in that sense. 06:53The second question we ask: does this system have agency? Does this system have controls
and limits that live somewhere that prevent it from doing certain
kinds of things under certain conditions. The reality with lifts,
that's absolutely the case. Think of any lift you've been in. There's a red keyslot
in the elevator carriage that an emergency services person
can stick a key into and override the whole system. But what happens
when that system is AI-driven? Where does the key live? Is it a physical key, is it a digital key? Who gets to use it? Is that the emergency services people? And how would you know
if that was happening? How would all of that be manifested
to you in the lift? 07:35The third question we ask
is how do we think about assurance. How do we think about all of its pieces: safety, security, trust, risk,
liability, manageability, explicability, ethics,
public policy, law, regulation? And how would we tell you
that the system was safe and functioning? 07:54The fourth question we ask is what would be our interfaces
with these AI-driven systems. Will we talk to them? Will they talk to us,
will they talk to each other? And what will it mean to have
a series of technologies we've known, for some of us, all our lives, now suddenly behave
in entirely different ways? Lifts, cars, the electrical grid,
traffic lights, things in your home. 08:15The fifth question
for these AI-driven systems: What will the indicators be
to show that they're working well? Two hundred years
of the industrial revolution tells us that the two most important ways
to think about a good system are productivity and efficiency. In the 21st century, you might want to expand
that just a little bit. Is the system sustainable, is it safe, is it responsible? Who gets to judge those things for us? Users of the systems
would want to understand how these things are regulated,
managed and built. 08:45And then there's the final,
perhaps most critical question that you need to ask
of these new AI systems. What's its intent? What's the system designed to do and who said that was a good idea? Or put another way, what is the world
that this system is building, how is that world imagined, and what is its relationship
to the world we live in today? Who gets to be part of that conversation? Who gets to articulate it? How does it get framed and imagined? 09:14There are no simple answers
to these questions. Instead, they frame what's possible and what we need to imagine, design, build, regulate
and even decommission. They point us in the right directions and help us on a path to establish
a new branch of engineering. But critical questions aren't enough. You also need a way of holding
all those questions together. 09:38footnotefootnoteFor us at the Institute, we're also really interested
in how to think about AI as a system, and where and how to draw
the boundaries of that system. And those feel like especially
important things right now. Here, we're influenced by the work
that was started way back in the 1940s. In 1944, along with anthropologists
Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, mathematician Norbert Wiener
convened a series of conversations that would become known
as the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics. Ultimately, between 1946 and 1953, ten conferences were held
under the banner of cybernetics. As defined by Norbert Wiener, cybernetics sought
to ""develop a language and techniques that will enable us to indeed attack
the problem of control and communication in advanced computing technologies."" Cybernetics argued persuasively that one had to think
about the relationship between humans, computers and the broader ecological world. You had to think about them
as a holistic system. Participants in the Macy Conferences
were concerned with how the mind worked, with ideas about
intelligence and learning, and about the role
of technology in our future. 10:45Sadly, the conversations that started
with the Macy Conference are often forgotten
when the talk is about AI. But for me, there's something
really important to reclaim here about the idea of a system
that has to accommodate culture, technology and the environment. At the Institute, that sort
of systems thinking is core to our work. 11:05Over the last three years, a whole collection of amazing people
have joined me here on this crazy journey to do this work. Our staff includes anthropologists, systems and environmental engineers,
and computer scientists as well as a nuclear physicist, an award-winning photo journalist, and at least one policy
and standards expert. It's a heady mix. And the range of experience
and expertise is powerful, as are the conflicts and the challenges. Being diverse requires
a constant willingness to find ways to hold people
in conversation. And to dwell just a little bit
with the conflict. 11:41We also worked out early that the way to build
a new way of doing things would require a commitment to bringing
others along on that same journey with us. So we opened our doors
to an education program very quickly, and we launched our first
master's program in 2018. Since then, we've had two cohorts
of master's students and one cohort of PhD students. Our students come from all over the world and all over life. Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Nepal, Mexico, India, the United States. And they range in age from 23 to 60. They variously had backgrounds
in maths and music, policy and performance, systems and standards, architecture and arts. Before they joined us at the Institute, they ran companies,
they worked for government, served in the army, taught high school, and managed arts organizations. They were adventurers and committed to each other, and to building something new. And really, what more could you ask for? 12:38Because although I've spent
20 years in Silicon Valley and I know the stories
about the lone inventor and the hero's journey, I also know the reality. That it's never just a hero's journey. It's always a collection of people
who have a shared sense of purpose who can change the world. So where do you start? 12:57Well, I think you start where you stand. And for me, that means
I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land
upon which I'm standing. The Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, this is their land, never ceded, always sacred. And I pay my respects to the elders,
past and present, of this place. I also acknowledge
that we're gathering today in many other places, and I pay my respects
to the traditional owners and elders of all those places too. 13:21It means a lot to me
to get to say those words and to dwell on what they mean and signal. And to remember that we live in a country that has been continuously occupied
for at least 60,000 years. Aboriginal people built worlds here, they built social systems,
they built technologies. They built ways to manage this place and to manage it remarkably
over a protracted period of time. And every moment any one of us
stands on a stage as Australians, here or abroad, we carry with us a privilege
and a responsibility because of that history. And it's not just a history. It's also an incredibly rich
set of resources, worldviews and knowledge. And it should run through all of our bones and it should be the story we always tell. 14:03Ultimately, it's about
thinking differently, asking different kinds of questions, looking holistically
at the world and the systems, and finding other people who want
to be on that journey with you. Because for me, the only way to actually think
about the future and scale is to always be doing it collectively. And because for me, the notion of humans in it together is one of the ways
we get to think about things that are responsible, safe and ultimately, sustainable. 14:33Thank you."
3,My seven species of robot — and how we created them,Dennis Hong,Apr 2010,"Meet seven all-terrain robots -- like the humanoid, soccer-playing DARwIn and the cliff-gripping CLIMBeR -- built by Dennis Hong's robotics team at RoMeLa, based at Virginia Tech. Watch to the end for the five creative secrets to his lab's success.", (69K),"Transcript (26 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So the first robot
to talk about is called STriDER. It stands for Self-excited
Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs,
which is inspired by nature. But have you seen anything in nature,
an animal that has three legs? Probably not. So why do I call this
a biologically inspired robot? How would it work? But before that,
let's look at pop culture. So, you know H.G. Wells's
""War of the Worlds,"" novel and movie. And what you see over here
is a very popular video game, and in this fiction, they describe
these alien creatures and robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot, STriDER,
does not move like this. 00:39This is an actual dynamic
simulation animation. I'm going to show you how the robot works. It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So that's how it walks. But when you look at us
human beings, bipedal walking, what you're doing is, you're not really using muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot. What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall, stand up again, swing your leg
and catch the fall. You're using your built-in dynamics,
the physics of your body, just like a pendulum. We call that the concept
of passive dynamic locomotion. What you're doing is, when you stand up, potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process. So even though there is nothing
in nature that looks like this, really, we're inspired by biology
and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot. 01:32What you see here,
this is what we want to do next. We want to fold up the legs
and shoot it up for long-range motion. And it deploys legs --
it looks almost like ""Star Wars"" -- so when it lands, it absorbs
the shock and starts walking. What you see over here, this yellow thing,
this is not a death ray. 01:47(Laughter) 01:48This is just to show you that if you have cameras
or different types of sensors, because it's 1.8 meters tall, you can see over obstacles like bushes
and those kinds of things. 01:57So we have two prototypes. The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I. The one in front,
the smaller, is STriDER II. The problem we had with STriDER I is,
it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors aligning the joints and those kinds of things. So we decided to synthesize
a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors,
and with a single motor, we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
instead of using mechatronics. So with this, now the top body
is lighted up; it's walking in our lab. This was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down, so we still have a lot of work to do. 02:33The second robot I want
to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility
Platform with Actuated Spoke System. It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot. So think of a rimless wheel
or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually
move in and out of the hub; so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid. We're literally reinventing
the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works. So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach. Just simply using
the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk
over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes
down and changes. And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses
over these types of terrains. 03:14But, when it encounters
a very extreme terrain -- in this case, this obstacle
is more than three times the height of the robot -- then it switches to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder
and camera systems to identify the obstacle and the size. And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so it can show
this very impressive mobility. You probably haven't seen
anything like this out there. This is a very high-mobility robot
that we developed called IMPASS. Ah, isn't that cool? 03:46When you drive your car, when you steer your car, you use
a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this. For most small-wheeled robots, they use a method
called differential steering where the left and right wheel
turn the opposite direction. For IMPASS, we can do many,
many different types of motion. For example, in this case, even though the left and right
wheels are connected with a single axle rotating
at the same angle of velocity, we simply change the length
of the spoke, it affects the diameter, then can turn to the left
and to the right. These are just some examples
of the neat things we can do with IMPASS. 04:21This robot is called CLIMBeR: Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
Matching Behavior Robot. I've been talking
to a lot of NASA JPL scientists -- at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers -- and the scientists,
geologists always tell me that the real interesting science,
the science-rich sites, are always at the cliffs. But the current rovers cannot get there. So, inspired by that,
we wanted to build a robot that can climb
a structured cliff environment. 04:46So this is CLIMBeR. It has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has
a winch and a cable at the top. It tries to figure out
the best place to put its foot. And then once it figures that out, in real time, it calculates
the force distribution: how much force it needs
to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot, and then with the winch,
it can climb up these kinds of cliffs. Also for search and rescue
applications as well. 05:13Five years ago,
I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow. And they already had
a six-legged robot called LEMUR. So this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS: Multi-Appendage Robotic System. It's a hexapod robot. We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting
payload on there. The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking
over unstructured terrain. 05:36(Motor sound) 05:37It's trying to walk
on the coastal terrain, a sandy area, but depending on the moisture content
or the grain size of the sand, the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
so it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross
over these kind of things. It also does some fun stuff. As you can imagine,
we get so many visitors visiting our lab. So when the visitors come,
MARS walks up to the computer, starts typing, ""Hello, my name is MARS. Welcome to RoMeLa, the Robotics Mechanisms
Laboratory at Virginia Tech."" 06:05(Laughter) 06:06This robot is an amoeba robot. Now, we don't have enough time
to go into technical details, I'll just show you
some of the experiments. These are some of the early
feasibility experiments. We store potential energy
to the elastic skin to make it move, or use active tension cords
to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. We also have been working
with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated
version of this amoeba robot. We do something to something, and just like magic, it moves. ""The Blob."" 06:39This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL: Robotic Air-Powered Hand
with Elastic Ligaments. There are a lot of really neat,
very good robotic hands out there on the market. The problem is,
they're just too expensive -- tens of thousands of dollars. So for prosthesis applications
it's probably not too practical, because it's not affordable. We wanted to tackle this problem
in a very different direction. Instead of using electrical motors,
electromechanical actuators, we're using compressed air. We developed these novel actuators
for the joints, so it's compliant. You can actually change the force, simply just changing the air pressure. And it can actually crush
an empty soda can. It can pick up very delicate
objects like a raw egg, or in this case, a lightbulb. The best part: it took only 200 dollars
to make the first prototype. 07:25This robot is actually
a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS, Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
Articulated Serpentine. This is a robot that can climb structures. This is a HyDRAS's arm. It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. But the cool part is the user interface. The cable over there,
that's an optical fiber. This student, it's probably
her first time using it, but she can articulate it
in many different ways. So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
there are roadside bombs. Currently, you send these remotely
controlled vehicles that are armed. It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm. In this case, it's very intuitive; this student, probably
his first time using it, is doing very complex manipulation tasks, picking up objects and doing
manipulation, just like that. Very intuitive. 08:14Now, this robot
is currently our star robot. We actually have a fan club
for the robot, DARwIn: Dynamic Anthropomorphic
Robot with Intelligence. As you know, we're very interested
in human walking, so we decided to build
a small humanoid robot. This was in 2004; at that time, this was something really,
really revolutionary. This was more of a feasibility study: What kind of motors should we use?
Is it even possible? What kinds of controls should we do? This does not have any sensors,
so it's an open-loop control. For those who probably know,
if you don't have any sensors and there's any disturbances,
you know what happens. 08:48(Laughter) 08:50Based on that success, the following year
we did the proper mechanical design, starting from kinematics. And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005. It stands up, it walks -- very impressive. However, still, as you can see,
it has a cord, an umbilical cord. So we're still using
an external power source and external computation. 09:10So in 2006, now it's really
time to have fun. Let's give it intelligence. We give it all the computing
power it needs: a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
two FireWire cameras, rate gyros, accelerometers,
four forced sensors on the foot, lithium polymer batteries -- and now DARwIn II
is completely autonomous. It is not remote controlled.
There's no tethers. It looks around, searches for the ball ...
looks around, searches for the ball, and it tries to play a game of soccer
autonomously -- artificial intelligence. Let's see how it does. This was our very first trial, and ... 09:42(Video) Spectators: Goal! 09:48Dennis Hong: There is actually
a competition called RoboCup. I don't know how many of you
have heard about RoboCup. It's an international autonomous
robot soccer competition. And the actual goal of RoboCup is, by the year 2050, we want to have full-size,
autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human
World Cup champions and win. 10:11(Laughter) 10:12It's a true, actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal,
but we truly believe we can do it. 10:17This is last year in China. We were the very first team
in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition. This is this year in Austria. You're going to see the action
is three against three, completely autonomous. 10:30(Video) (Crowd groans) 10:31DH: There you go. Yes! The robots track and they team-play
amongst themselves. It's very impressive. It's really a research event, packaged in a more exciting
competition event. What you see here is the beautiful
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. This is for the best humanoid. We'd like to bring this, for the first
time, to the United States next year, so wish us luck. 10:54(Applause) 10:55Thank you. 10:57(Applause) 10:59DARwIn also has a lot of other talents. Last year, it actually conducted
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert. This is the next generation
robot, DARwIn IV, much smarter, faster, stronger. And it's trying to show off its ability: ""I'm macho, I'm strong."" 11:17(Laughter) 11:18""I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,
martial art movements."" 11:22(Laughter) 11:26And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV. Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby. We truly believe this will be
the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. So stay tuned. 11:36All right. So I showed you
some of our exciting robots at work. So, what is the secret of our success? Where do we come up with these ideas? How do we develop these kinds of ideas? We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments. We won a half a million dollars
in the DARPA Urban Challenge. We also have the world's very first
vehicle that can be driven by the blind. We call it the Blind Driver
Challenge, very exciting. And many, many other robotics
projects I want to talk about. These are just the awards
that we won in 2007 fall from robotics competitions
and those kinds of things. 12:06So really, we have five secrets. First is: Where do we get inspiration? Where do we get this spark of imagination? This is a true story, my personal story. At night, when I go to bed,
at three, four in the morning, I lie down, close my eyes,
and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. And they assemble, and they form
these kinds of mechanisms. And I think, ""Ah, this is cool."" So right next to my bed
I keep a notebook, a journal, with a special pen
that has an LED light on it, because I don't want to turn on the light
and wake up my wife. 12:35So I see this, scribble everything down,
draw things, and go to bed. Every day in the morning,
the first thing I do, before my first cup of coffee,
before I brush my teeth, I open my notebook. Many times it's empty;
sometimes I have something there. If something's there, sometimes it's junk. But most of the time,
I can't read my handwriting. Four in the morning --
what do you expect, right? So I need to decipher what I wrote. But sometimes I see
this ingenious idea in there, and I have this eureka moment. I directly run to my home office,
sit at my computer, I type in the ideas, I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas. So when we have these calls for proposals, I try to find a match
between my potential ideas and the problem. If there's a match,
we write a research proposal, get the research funding in, and that's how we start
our research programs. 13:21But just a spark of imagination
is not good enough. How do we develop these kinds of ideas? At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
and Mechanisms Laboratory, we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions. So we gather around, we discuss problems
and solutions and talk about it. But before we start,
we set this golden rule. The rule is: nobody criticizes anybody's ideas. Nobody criticizes any opinion. This is important, because many times,
students fear or feel uncomfortable about how others might think
about their opinions and thoughts. 13:52So once you do this, it is amazing
how the students open up. They have these wacky, cool,
crazy, brilliant ideas, and the whole room is just electrified
with creative energy. And this is how we develop our ideas. 14:05Well, we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is, you know, just a spark of idea
and development is not good enough. There was a great TED moment --
I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it? He gave a talk about how education
and school kill creativity. Well, actually,
there's two sides to the story. So there is only so much one can do
with just ingenious ideas and creativity
and good engineering intuition. If you want to go beyond a tinkering, if you want to go
beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle
the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research, we need more than that. This is where school comes in. 14:44Batman, fighting against the bad guys, he has his utility belt,
he has his grappling hook, he has all different kinds of gadgets. For us roboticists,
engineers and scientists, these tools are the courses
and classes you take in class. Math, differential equations. I have linear algebra, science, physics -- even, nowadays, chemistry
and biology, as you've seen. These are all the tools we need. So the more tools you have, for Batman, more effective at fighting the bad guys, for us, more tools to attack
these kinds of big problems. So education is very important. 15:18Also -- it's not only about that. You also have to work really, really hard. So I always tell my students, ""Work smart, then work hard."" This picture in the back --
this is three in the morning. I guarantee if you come
to our lab at 3, 4am, we have students working there, not because I tell them to,
but because we are having too much fun. Which leads to the last topic: do not forget to have fun. That's really the secret of our success,
we're having too much fun. I truly believe that highest productivity
comes when you're having fun, and that's what we're doing. And there you go. 15:49Thank you so much. 15:50(Applause)"

The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov, a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine. To many, this was the dawn of a new era, one where man would be dominated by machine. But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad, not HAL. 00:23The second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose. At first, the results were predictable. Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop. The surprise came at the end. Who won? Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer, but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops. Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries. This is an astonishing result: average men, average machines beating the best man, the best machine. And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine? Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation. 01:18We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years. It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it. It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science. But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems, of open platforms, and embedded technology, I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time. I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis, perhaps better termed ""intelligence augmentation,"" I.A. 01:48Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet. His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions, controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. Note that word ""cooperate."" Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it Data from ""Star Trek,"" but to take a human and make her more capable. Humans are so amazing -- how we think, our non-linear approaches, our creativity, iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do. Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses, determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation. Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited. We're terrible at scale, computation and volume. We require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing. Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making. 02:46Silently, without much fanfare, this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess. Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess — there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe. This is a world-changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease. And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough. Foldit, a game created by computer scientists, illustrates the value of the approach. Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein, allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues. This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time and tied 30 percent of the time. Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days, perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game. 03:44Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers, the 9/11 memorial opened. It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called ""meaningful adjacency."" It places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers. When you put it all together, it's quite a computational challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests, the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics. When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced. While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework, humans used that framework to design the final result. So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system, and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables, allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices. So the more you look around you, the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere. Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car, human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable. 04:47So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis, what can you do? You can start by designing the human into the process. Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem, design the solution around what the human will do as well. When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent all of your time on the interface between man and machine, specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction. In fact, this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability. That's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster. What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction. The better the process, the less the friction. And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable. 05:28Or take another example: big data. Every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone, your credit card, your computer. The result is big data, and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition. The major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on, ""How do I store this data? How do I search this data? How do I process this data?"" These are necessary but insufficient questions. The imperative is not to figure out how to compute, but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition on data at this scale? 05:57Again, we start by designing the human into the process. When PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest challenge was not, ""How do I send money back and forth online?"" It was, ""How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"" Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns, they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before, and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people, relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit — (Laughter) — and one huge and important difference: purpose. And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure. 06:36There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers. Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption, and increasingly these problems are buried in big data. 06:50For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite what you might see on TV, these adaptations, and the detection of them, are fundamentally human. Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors, but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses, searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them. Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence. He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies. 07:20As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer. There is no ""Find Terrorist"" button, and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be. Instead, people will have to look at data and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago, the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation, and as Kasparov realized, that means minimizing friction at the interface. 07:48Now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources, identifying key relationships and putting them in one place, something that's been nearly impossible to do before. To some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections, but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance. That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside, even with the best of intents. 08:15So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time. 08:22In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq. They found a treasure trove of documents: 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters. These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf, the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq. These records were human resource forms. The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization. It turns out that al Qaeda, too, is not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter) They answered questions like, ""Who recruited you?"" ""What's your hometown?"" ""What occupation do you seek?"" 08:54In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed. The vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom -- hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability. Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated. The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs and tenacity alone. The researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged. Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya, 50 percent of those from a single town in Libya, hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi, a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group. In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters. 09:53Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious, by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border. These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues, who were in the coordination business for profit. For example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans, money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda. Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists. 10:22In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people, 10 percent of the population, homeless. One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling. January and February are the dry months in Haiti, yet many of the camps had developed standing water. The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake, leadership inside. So the question is, which camps are at risk, how many people are in these camps, what's the timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation? The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country. There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated. The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need. The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information, social media data and relief organization information to answer this question. By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours, 11:32all victories for human-computer symbiosis. 11:35We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision for the future, and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems, man and machine in cooperation together. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause)"
3,What would happen if we upload our brains to computers?,Robin Hanson,Aug 2017,"Meet the ""ems"" -- machines that emulate human brains and can think, feel and work just like the brains they're copied from. Futurist and social scientist Robin Hanson describes a possible future when ems take over the global economy, running on superfast computers and copying themselves to multitask, leaving humans with only one choice: to retire, forever. Glimpse a strange future as Hanson describes what could happen if robots ruled the earth.", (44K),"Transcript (16 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийالعربيةفارسىతెలుగు中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01Someday, we may have robots
as smart as people, artificial intelligence, AI. How could that happen? One route is that we'll just keep
accumulating better software, like we've been doing for 70 years. At past rates of progress,
that may take centuries. Some say it'll happen a lot faster as we discover grand new
powerful theories of intelligence. I'm skeptical. 00:28But a third scenario is what I'm going to talk about today. The idea is to port the software
from the human brain. To do this, we're going to need
three technologies to be good enough, and none of them are there yet. First, we're going to need
lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers. Second, we're going to need
to scan individual human brains in fine spatial and chemical detail, to see exactly what cells are where,
connected to what, of what type. And third, we're going to need
computer models of how each kind of brain cell works -- taking input signals,
changing interval state and sending output signals. If we have good enough models
of all the kinds of brain cells and a good enough model of the brain, we can put it together to make
a good enough model of an entire brain, and that model would have the same
input-output behavior as the original. So if you talk to it, it might talk back. If you ask it to do things,
it might do them. And if we could do that,
everything would change. 01:31People have been talking
about this idea for decades, under the name of ""uploads."" I'm going to call them ""ems."" When they talk about it, they say, ""Is this even possible? If you made one, would it be conscious?
Or is it just an empty machine? If you made one of me,
is that me or someone else?"" These are all fascinating questions
that I'm going to ignore ... 01:52(Laughter) 01:55because I see a neglected question: What would actually happen? I became obsessed with this question. I spent four years trying to analyze it, using standard academic tools,
to guess what would happen, and I'm here to tell you what I found. But be warned -- I'm not offering inspiration,
I'm offering analysis. I see my job as telling you
what's most likely to happen if we did the least to avoid it. If you aren't at least a bit disturbed
by something I tell you here, you're just not paying attention. 02:29(Laughter) 02:30OK, the first thing I can tell you is that ems spend most
of their life in virtual reality. This is what you might look like
if you were using virtual reality. And this is what you might see: sunlight glinting off of water,
you might hear gulls flying above, you might even feel the wind
on your cheeks or smell seawater, with advanced hardware. Now, if you were to spend
a lot of time here, you might want a dashboard where you could do things like
make a phone call, move to a new virtual world, check your bank account. 03:03Now, while this is what
you would look like in virtual reality, this is what an em
would look like in virtual reality. It's computer hardware
sitting in a server rack somewhere. But still, it could see
and experience the same thing. But some things are different for ems. First, while you'll probably always notice
that virtual reality isn't entirely real, to an em, it can feel as real to them
as this room feels to you now or as anything ever feels. And ems also have
some more action possibilities. 03:32For example, your mind just always
runs at the same speed, but an em can add more or less
computer hardware to run faster or slower, and therefore, if the world around them
seems to be going too fast, they can just speed up their mind, and the world around them
would seem to slow down. 03:46In addition, an em can make
a copy of itself at that moment. This copy would remember
everything the same, and if it starts out with the same speed,
looking at the same speed, it might even need to be told,
""You are the copy."" And em could make archive copies, and with enough archives, an em can be immortal -- in principle, though not
usually in practice. And an em can move its brain,
the computer that represents its brain, from one physical location to another. Ems can actually move around the world
at the speed of light, and by moving to a new location, they can interact more quickly
with ems near that new location. 04:24So far, I've been talking about
what ems can do. What do ems choose to do? To understand that, we'll need
to understand three key facts. First, ems by definition do what
the human they emulate would do in the same situation. So their lives and behavior
are very human. They're mainly different because
they're living in a different world. Second, ems need
real resources to survive. You need food and shelter or you'll die. Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can't exist. For every subjective minute
that an em experiences, someone, usually that em,
had to work to pay for it. Third, ems are poor. 05:09(Laughter) 05:11The em population can grow
quicker than the em economy, so that means wages fall down
to em subsistence levels. That means ems have to be working
most of the time. So that means
this is what ems usually see: beautiful and luxurious, but desks -- they're working most of the time. Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
you might think, is exotic and strange, but it's actually the usual case
in human history, and it's how pretty much
all wild animals have ever lived, so we know what humans do
in this situation. Humans basically do
what it takes to survive, and this is what lets me say
so much about the em world. When creatures are rich, like you, you have to know a lot
about what they want to figure out what they do. When creatures are poor, you know that they mostly do
what it takes to survive. 05:56So we've been talking about the em world
from the point of view of the ems -- now, let's step back
and look at their whole world. First, the em world grows
much faster than ours, roughly a hundred times faster. So the amount of change
we would experience in a century or two, they would experience in a year or two. And I'm not really willing to project
this age much beyond that, because plausibly by then something else
will happen, I don't know what. Second, the typical emulation
runs even faster, roughly a thousand times human speed. So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two, and for them, the world around them
is actually changing more slowly than your world seems to change for you. Third, ems are crammed together
in a small number of very dense cities. This is not only how they see
themselves in virtual reality, it's also how they actually are
physically crammed together. So at em speeds, physical travel
feels really painfully slow, so most em cities are self-sufficient, most war is cyber war, and most of the rest of the earth
away from the em cities is left to the humans, because the ems
really aren't that interested in it. 07:02Speaking of humans, you were wanting to hear about that. Humans must retire, at once, for good. They just can't compete. Now, humans start out owning
all of the capital in this world. The economy grows very fast,
their wealth grows very fast. Humans get rich, collectively. As you may know, most humans today
don't actually own that much besides their ability to work, so between now and then,
they need to acquire sufficient assets, insurance or sharing arrangements, or they may starve. I highly recommend avoiding this outcome. 07:36(Laughter) 07:38Now, you might wonder, why would ems let humans exist? Why not kill them, take their stuff? But notice we have many
unproductive retirees around us today, and we don't kill them
and take their stuff. 07:48(Laughter) 07:50In part, that's because it would disrupt
the institutions we share with them. Other groups would wonder who's next, so plausibly, ems may well let humans
retire in peace during the age of em. You should worry more that
the age of em only lasts a year or two and you don't know what happens next. 08:09Ems are very much like humans, but they are not like the typical human. The typical em is a copy
of the few hundred most productive humans. So in fact, they are as elite,
compared to the typical human, as the typical billionaire,
Nobel Prize winner, Olympic gold medalist, head of state. Ems look on humans
perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude, but not so much respect, which is, if you think about it,
how you think about your ancestors. We know many things about how humans
differ in terms of productivity. We can just use those
to predict features of ems -- for example, they tend to be smart,
conscientious, hard-working, married, religious, middle-aged. These are features of ems. 08:52Em world also contains enormous variety. Not only does it continue on with most
of the kinds of variety that humans do, including variety of industry
and profession, they also have many new kinds of variety, and one of the most important
is mind speed. Ems can plausibly go from human speed up to a million times
faster than human speed, and down to a billion times
slower than human speed. Faster ems tend to have
markers of high status. They embody more wealth.
They win arguments. They sit at premium locations. Slower ems are mostly retirees, and they are like the ghosts
of our literature. If you recall, ghosts are all around us -- you can interact with them
if you pay the price. But they don't know much,
they can't influence much, and they're obsessed with the past,
so what's the point? 09:36(Laughter) 09:37Ems also have more variety
in the structure of their lives. This is your life: you start
and you end, really simple. This is the life of an em, who every day splits off
some short-term copies to do short-term tasks and then end. We'll talk more about
those short term versions in a moment, but they are much more efficient because they don't have to rest
for the next day. This em is more opportunistic. They make more copies of themselves
when there's more demand for that. They don't know which way
the future's going. 10:04This is an em designer, who conceives of a large system and then breaks recursively into copies
who elaborate that, so ems can implement
larger, more coherent designs. This an emulation plumber who remembers that every day,
for the last 20 years, they only ever worked
two hours a day, a life of leisure. But what really happened is,
every day they had a thousand copies, each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job, and only one of them
went on to the next day. Objectively, they're working
well over 99 percent of the time. Subjectively, they remember
a life of leisure. 10:33(Laughter) 10:34This, again, is you.
You start and you end. This could be you
if at the start of party, you took a drug that meant
you would not remember that party ever after that day. Some people do this, I'm told. Toward the end of the party, will you say to yourself,
""I'm about to die, this is terrible. That person tomorrow isn't me,
because they won't remember what I do."" Or you could say, ""I will go on tomorrow.
I just won't remember what I did."" This is an em who splits off
a short-term copy to do a short-term task and then end. They have the same two
attitude possibilities. They can say, ""I'm a new short-term
creature with a short life. I hate this."" Or ""I'm a part of a larger creature
who won't remember this part."" I predict they'll have
that second attitude, not because it's philosophically correct,
but because it helps them get along. 11:16Today, if the president says
we must invade Iraq, and you say, ""Why?"" and they say, ""State secret,"" you're not sure if you can trust them, but for ems, a copy of the president
and a copy of you can go inside a safe, explain all their secret reasons, and then one bit comes out
from your copy to yourself, telling you if you were convinced. So now you can know
there is a good reason. 11:35I know you guys are all eager
to evaluate this world. You're eager to decide
if you love it or hate it. But think: your ancestors
from thousands of years ago would have loved or hated your world based on the first few things
they heard about it, because your world
is really just weird. So before judging a strange future world,
you should really learn a lot about it, maybe read a whole book about it, and then, if you don't like it,
work to change it. 11:57Thank you. 11:58(Applause)"
3,The race to build AI that benefits humanity with Sam Altman,The TED Interview,Apr 2021,"In this new season of The TED Interview, conversations with people who make a case for ... optimism. Not some blind, hopeful feeling, but the conviction that somewhere out there are solutions that, given the right attention and resources, can guide us out of the dark place we're in. For the first episode: artificial intelligence. Will innovation in AI drastically improve our lives, or destroy humanity as we know it? Head of TED Chris Anderson sits down with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, ...", (30K),"Transcript (1 Language)English00:05Hello there, this is Chris Anderson,
and I am hugely, hugely, tremendously excited to welcome you to
a new series of the TED interview. Now, then, this season, we're
trying something new. We're organising the whole season
around a single theme, albeit a theme that some of you may
consider inappropriate. But hear me out. The theme is the case for optimism. And yes, I know the world has been hit
with extraordinarily ugly things in the last few years. Political division, a
racial reckoning, technology run amuck, not to mention a global pandemic and
impending climate catastrophe. What on earth are we thinking
in this context? Optimism just seems so naive and unwanted,
almost annoying. So here's my position. Don't think
of optimism as a feeling. It's not just this sort of shallow feeling
of hope. Optimism is a search. It's a determination to look for a pathway
forward somewhere out there. I believe I truly believe there are
amazing people whose minds contain the ideas, the visions, the solutions that
can actually create that pathway forward. If given the support
and resources they need, they may very well light the path
out of this dark place we're in. So these are the people who can present
not optimism, but a case for optimism. They're the people I'm talking
to this season. So let's see if they can persuade us now. Then the place I want to start is with
A.I. artificial intelligence. This, of course, is the next innovative
technology that is going to change everything as we know it,
for better or for worse. Today was painted not with the
usual dystopian brush, but by someone who truly believes
in its potential. Sam Altman is the former president
of Y Combinator, the legendary startup accelerator. And in 2015, he and a team launched
a company called Open Eye, dedicated to one noble purpose to develop
A.I. so that it benefits humanity as a whole. You may have heard, by the way, recently a lot of buzz around in A.I.
technology called T3 that was developed by open eye improve the quality of
the amazing team of researchers and developers they have work in. There will be hearing a lot about
three in the conversation ahead. But sticking to this lofty mission of
developing A.I. for humanity and finding the resources to realize
it haven't been simple. Open A.I. is certainly not
without its critics, but their goal couldn't be more important. And honestly, I found it really quite
exciting to hear Sam's vision for where all this could lead. OK,
let's do this. So, Sam Altman, welcome. Thank you for having me. So, Sam, here we are in 2021. A lot of people are fearful of the future at this moment
in world history. How would you describe your
attitude to the future? I think that the combination of scientific
and technological progress and better societal decision making, better societal governance
is going to solve in the next couple of decades all of our
current most pressing problems, there will be new ones. But I think
we are going to get very safe, very inexpensive, carbon free
nuclear energy to work. And I think we're going to talk about that
time that the climate disaster looks so bad and how lucky we are. We got saved
by science and technology, I think. And we've already now seen this with the rapidity that we were able
to get vaccines deployed. We are going to find that we are
able to cure or at least treat a significant percentage of human disease, including I think we'll just actually make
progress in helping people have much longer decades, longer health spans. And I think in the next couple of decades,
that will look pretty clear. I think we will build systems with AI
and otherwise that make access to an incredibly high quality education
more possible than ever before. I think the lives we look forward like
one hundred years, fifty years, even the quality of life available to
anyone then will be much better than the quality of life available in the
very best case to anyone today, to any single person today. So, yeah,
I'm super optimistic. I think, like, it's always easy to do
scroll and think about how bad are the bad things are, but the good things
are really good and getting much better. Is it your sincere belief that artificial
intelligence can actually make that future better? Certainly. How look, with any technology.
I don't think it will all be better. I think there are always positive and
negative use cases of anything new, and it's our job to maximize
the positive ones, minimize the negative ones. But I truly, genuinely believe that the positive impacts will be orders of
magnitude bigger than the negative ones. I think we're seeing a
glimpse of that now. Now that we have the first general
purpose built out in the world and available via things like RPI, I think we are seeing evidence of just the breadth of services that
we will be able to offer as the sort of technological revolution
really takes hold. And we will have people interact with
services that are smart, really smart, and it will feel like as strange as the world before mobile phones
feels now to us. Hmm, yeah, you mentioned your API,
I guess that stands for what, application programming interface? It's the technology that allows complex
technology to be accessible to others. So give me a sense of a couple of things
that have got you most excited that are already out there and then how
that gives you visibility to a pathway forward that is
even more exciting. So I think that the things that we're
seeing now are very much glimpse of the future. We released three, which is a general-purpose natural
language text model in the summer of twenty twenty. You know, there's hundreds of applications
that are now using it in production that's ramping
up all of the time. But there are things where people
use three to really understand the intent behind the search
query and deliver results and sort of understand not only intent, but all of the data and deliver
the thing of what you want. So you can sort of describe a fuzzy thing
and it'll understand documents. It can understand, you know, short
documents, not full books yet, but bring you back to the context
of what you want. There's been a lot of excitement
about using the generative capabilities
to create sort of games or sort of interactive stories or letting
people develop characters or chat with a sort of virtual friend. There are applications that, for example, help a job seeker polish a tailored
application for each individual company. There's the beginning of tutors that can
sort of teach people about different concepts and take on different personas.
And we can go on for a long time. But I think anything that you can imagine
that you do today via computer that you would like to really understand
and get to know you. And not only that, but understand all of
the data and knowledge in the world and help you have the best experience that
is is possible that that will happen. So what gets opened up? What new adjacent
possible state is that as a result of these powers
from this question, from the point of view of someone who's
starting out on a career, for example, they're trying to figure out what would
be a really interesting thing to do in the future that has only recently
become possible. What are some new things
that this opens up in a world where you can
talk to a computer? And get. The output that would
normally require you hiring the world experts back immediately
for almost no money, I would say think about
what's possible there. So that could be like, as you said, what can normally only the best
programmer in the world or a really great programmer do for me. And can I now instead just ask in English
and have that program written? So all these people that, you know, want
to develop an app and they have an idea, but they don't know how to program.
Now they can have it. You know, what is the service
look like when anyone on Earth who wants really
great medical advice? Can get better medical advice than
any single doctor could ever get, because this has the total medical
knowledge and reasoning ability that the some humanity has ever produced. When you want to learn something, you have sort of a tutor that understands
your exact style, how you best learn everything you know, and custom teaches you whatever concept
you want to learn someday. You can imagine that like. You have an eye that reads your email
and your task list and your calendar and the documents you've been sent and in any meeting maximally perfectly
prepares you and has all of the information that you need in all the context of your entire career right
there for you to go on for a long time. But I think this will just
be powerful systems. So it's really fun playing around
with Chapatti three, one compelling example of someone
who's more tax base is try Googling The Guardian essay that was
written entirely by different GP2 three queries and stitched together. It's an essay on why artificial
intelligence isn't a threat to humanity. And that's impressive.
It's very compelling. I actually tried inputting one
of the three online uses. I asked the question what is interesting
about some ollman? Oh no. Here's what it came back with. It was it
was rather philosophical, actually. Came back with. I don't understand
what you mean by interesting. It seems to me that this word has
no unambiguous meaning in the context of human society beyond its
literal definition as somewhat pleasing or entertaining. I do not believe
there to be any such thing as INTERESTINGNESS except
in the mind of a human or other sentient being
that to my knowledge, this is an entirely subjective state
that varies from person to person. However, I will grant that this is
an interesting question to ask. This does not mean it has been answered.
There is no answer to be found. Well, so you can agree that somewhere
between profound and gibberish is that almost well, with the
state of play is I mean, that's where we are today. I think somewhere between profound
and jibberish is the right way to think about the current
capabilities of CGP three. I think they would definitely had a bubble
of hype about three last summer. But the thing about bubbles is the
reason that smart people fall for them is there's a kernel
of something really real and really interesting that people
get overexcited about. And I think people definitely got and still are overexcited
about 3:00 today, but still probably underestimated the potential of where these models
will go in the future. And so maybe there's this like short term
overhyped and long term under hype for the entire field, for tax models, for
whatever you'd like. It's going on. And as you said, there's clearly
some gibberish in there. But on the other hand, those were
like well-formed sentences. And there were a couple of ideas
and there that I was like, oh, like they actually maybe that's right. And I think if artificial intelligence,
even in its current very larval state, can make us confront new things
and sort of inspire new ideas, that's already pretty impressive. Give us a sense of what's actually
happening in the background there. I think it's hard to understand because you read these words seem like
someone is trying to mean something. Obviously, I think you believe that
there's whatever you've built there, that there's a sort of thinking, sentient
thing that's going, oh, I must answer this question. So so what
how would you describe what's going on? You've got something that has
read the entire Internet, essentially all of Wikipedia, etc. We've read something that's read like a small
fraction of a random sampling of the Internet. We will eventually train
something that has read as much of the Internet or more of the Internet
than we've done right now. But we have a very long way to go. I mean, we're still, I think, relative to what we will have operated
at quite small scale with quite small eyes. But what is happening is there is
a model that is ingesting lots of text and it is trying to predict the next word. So we use Transformer's they
take in a context, which is a particular architecture
of an A.I. model, they take in a context of a lot of words, let's say like a thousand
or something like that. And they try to predict the word that
comes next in the sequence. And there's like a lot of other
things that happen, but fundamentally that's it, and I think this is interesting
because in the process of playing that little game
of trying to predict the next word, these models have to develop
a representation and understanding of what is
likely to come next and. I think it is maybe not
perfectly accurate, but certainly worth considering to say
that intelligence is very near the ability to make accurate predictions. What's confusing about this is that
there are so many words on the Internet which are foolish as
well as the words that are wise. And and how do you build a model that
can distinguish between those two? And this is prompted actually by another
example that I typed in. Like I asked, you know, what is a powerful
idea, very interested in ideas. That was my question as a powerful idea. And it came back with several things, some of which seemed moderately
pronouncements, which seemed moderately gibberish. But then he was he was one that it
came back with the idea that the human race has, quote, evolved,
unquote, is false evolution or adaptation within
a species was abandoned by biology and genetics long ago. Wait a sec. That's
news to me. What have you been reading? And I presume this has been pulled out
of some recesses of the Internet, but how is it possible, even in theory, to imagine how a model can gravitate
towards truth, wisdom, as opposed to just like majority views? Or how how how do you avoid something
taking us further into the sort of the maze of errors and bad thinking
and so forth that has already been a worrying feature for the last few years
? It's a fantastic question, and I think it is the most interesting
area of research that we need to pursue. Now, I think at this point, the questions of whether we can build
really powerful general-purpose AI system, I won't say there in the rearview mirror. We still have a lot of hard
engineering work to do, but I'm pretty confident we're
going to be able to. And now the questions are like,
what should we build? And how and why and what
data should we train on and how do we build systems not just that
can do these like phenomenally impressive things, but that we can ensure
do the things that we want and that understand the concepts of
truth and falsehood and, you know, alignment with human values and
misalignment with human values. One of the pieces of research that
we put out last year that I was most proud of and most excited
about is what we call reinforcement learning from human feedback. And we showed that we can take these
giant models that are trained on a bunch of stuff, some of it good,
some of the bad, and then with a really quite small amount
of feedback from human judgment about, hey, this is good, this
is bad, this is wrong, this is the behavior I want I
don't want this behavior. We can feed that information from the
human judges back into the model and we can teach the model, behave more
like this and less like that. And it works better than I
ever imagined it would. And that gives me a lot of hope that
we can build an aligned system. We'll do other things, too, like I think curating data sets where
there's just less sort of bad data to train on. It will go a very long way. And as these models get smarter, I think they inherently develop the ability to sort out bad
data from good data. And as they get really smart, they'll even start to do something
we call active learning, which is where they ask us for exactly the data they need when they're missing
something, when they're unsure, when they don't understand. But I think as a result of simply scaling
these models up, building better, I hate to use the word cognition because
it sounds so anthropomorphic, but let's say building a better ability
to reason into the models, to think, to challenge, to try to understand and combining that with this idea of
online into human values via this technique we developed, that's
going to go a very long way. Now, there's another question, which you sort of just kicked the
ball down the field, too, which is how do we as a society decide to
which set of human values do we align these powerful systems? Yeah, indeed. So if I if I understand
rightly what you're saying, that you're saying that it's
possible to look at the output at any one time of three. And if we don't like what it's coming up
with, some ways human can say, no, that was off, don't do that. Whatever algorithm or process led
you to that, undo it. Yeah. And that the system is that incredibly
powerful at avoiding that same kind of mistake in future because it sort
of replicates the instructions , correct? Yeah. And eventually and not much longer, I believe that we'll be able to not only
say that was good, that was bad, but say that was bad for this reason. And also tell me how you got to that
answer so I can make sure I understand. But at the end of the day, someone needs to decide
who is the wise human or short humans who are looking at the
results. So it's a big difference. Someone who who grew up with intelligent
design world view could look at that and go, that's a brilliant outcome. Well,
Goldstar done. And someone else would say something
is done awfully wrong here. So how do you avoid and this is a version of
the problem that a lot of the, I guess, Silicon Valley companies are facing
right now in terms of the pushback they're getting on the output
of social media and so forth. How do you assemble that pool
of experts who stand for human values that we actually want? I mean, we talk about this all the time, I don't think this is like solely or even not even close to majorly
up to opening night to decide, I think we need to begin a societal
conversation now about how we're going to make those decisions, how we're going to
make sure we have representational input in that, and how we sort of make these
very difficult global governance systems. My personal belief is that we should have
pretty broad rules about what these systems will never do and will always do. But then the individual user should get a system that kind of behaves
like they want. And there will be people do have
very different value systems. Some of them are just fundamentally
incompatible. No one gets to use eye to, like, exploit
other people, for example, and hopefully we can all agree on.
But do you want the AI to like. You know, support you and your belief
of intelligent design, like, do I think openly, I should say it can't, even though I disagree with that is
like a scientific conclusion. No, I wouldn't take that stance. I think the thing to remember about all
of this is that history is still quite extraordinarily weak. It's still has
such big problems and it's still so unreliable that for most use
cases it's still unsuitable. But when we think about a system that is
like a thousand times more powerful and let's say a million
times more reliable, it just doesn't it doesn't
say gibberish very often. It doesn't totally lose the
plot and get distracted or system like that is going to be one
that a lot of the economic activity in the world comes to rely on. And I think it's very important
that we don't have a small group of people sort of saying you
can never use it for this thing that, like most of the world
wants to use it for because it doesn't match
our personal beliefs. Talk a bit more about some
of the other uses of it, because one of the things that's most
surprising is it's not just about sort of text responses. It's it can take
generalized human instructions and build things up. For example,
you can say to it, write a Python program that
is designed to put a flashing cursor in one
corner of the screen, in the Google logo in the other corner. And and it can go your way and
do something like that. Shockingly, quite well, effectively. Yeah, I it can. That's amazing. I mean, this is amazing
to me. That opens the door to. An entirely way to think about
programers for the future, that you could you could have people who
can program just in human natural language potentially and gain rapid
efficiency. I do the engineering. We're not that far away from that world. We're not that far away from the world
where you will write a spec in English. And for a simple enough program, I
will just write the code for you. As you said, you can see glimpses of that
even in this very week three which was not trained to code like. I think
this is important to remember. We trained it on the language on the
Internet very rarely, you know, Internet let language on the Internet
also includes some code snippets. And that was enough, so if we really try
to go train a model on code itself and that's where we decide to put the
horsepower of the model into, just imagine what will be possible
will be quite impressive. But I think what you're pointing
to there is that because models like three
to some degree or other, and it's like very hard to know
exactly how much understand the underlying concepts
of what's going on. And they're not just regurgitating
things they found in a website, but they can really apply
them and say, oh, yeah, I kind of like know about this
word and this idea and code. And this is probably what you're trying to
do. And I won't get it right always. But sometimes I will just generate
this like a brand new program for nothing that anyone has ever
asked before. And it will work. That's pretty cool. And data is data. So
it can do that from English to code. It can do that from English to French. Again, we never told it to
learn about translation. We never told it about the concepts of
English and French, but it learned them, even though we never said this is what
English is and this is what French is and this is what it means to translate,
it can still do it. Wow, I mean, for creative people, is there a world coming where the sort of the palette of possibility that they
can be exposed to is just explodes? I mean, if you're a musician, is there a near future where you can say
to your eye, OK, I'm going to bed now, but in the morning I'd love
you to present me with a thousand tuba jingles with words
attached that you have of a sort of mean factor to the and you
come down in the morning and the computer shows you the stuff. And one
of them, you go, wow, that is it. That is a top 10 hit and you
build a song from it. Or is that going to be released?
Actually be the value add. We released something last
year called Jukebox, which is very near what you described, where you can say I want music generated
for me in this style or this kind of stuff, and it can
come up with the words as well. And it's like pretty cool. And I really
enjoy listening to music that it creates. And I can sort of do four songs, two bars
of a jingle, whatever you'd like. And one of my very favorite
artists reached out, called to open it after we release this
and said that he wanted to talk. And I was like, well, I like total fanboy
here. I'd love to join that call. And I was so nervous that he was
going to say, this is terrible. This is like a really sad thing
for human creativity. Like, you know, why are you doing this?
This is like whatever. And he was so excited. And he's like,
this has been so inspiring. I want to do a new album with this. You know, it's like, give
me all these new ideas. It's making me much better at my job. I'm going to make better music
because of this tool. And that was awesome. And I hope that's
how it all continues to go. And I think it is going to lead to this. We see a similar thing now with Dolly, where graphic designers sometimes tell us
that they just they see this new set of possibilities because there's
new creative inspiration and they're cycle time, like the amount
of time it takes to just come up with an idea and be able to look
at it and then decide whether to go down that path or head in a
different direction goes down so much. And so I think it's going to just be this
like incredible creative explosion for humans. And how far away are we some before? And I it comes up with a genuinely
powerful new idea, an idea that solves the problem that
humans have been wrestling with. It doesn't have to be as quite
on the scale as of, OK, we've got a virus coming. Please
describe to us what a what a national rational response
should look like, but some kind of genuinely
innovative idea or solution like one one internal question
we've asked ourselves is, when will the first genuinely interesting,
purely AI written TED talk show up? I think that's a great milestone. I will say it's always hard to guess
timeline's I'm sure I'll be wrong on this, but I would guess the
first genuinely interesting. Ted talk, thought of written delivered
by an AIDS within the kind of the seven ish year time frame.
Maybe a little bit less. And it feels like I mean, just reading
that Guardian essay that was kind of it was a composite of several different GPG
three responses to questions about, you know, the threats of
robotics or whatever. If you throw in a human
editor into the mix, you could probably imagine something much
sooner. Indeed. Like tomorrow. Yeah. So the hybrid the hybrid version where
it's basically a tool assisted TED talk, but that it is better than any TED talk a human could generate in one
hundred hours or whatever, if you can sort of combine human
discretion with A.I. horsepower. I suspect that's like our next year or two years from now kind of thing
where it's just really quite good. That's that's really interesting. How do
you view the impact of A.I. on jobs? There's obviously been the familiar story
is that every White-Collar job is now up for destruction. What's
what's your view there? You know, it's I think it's always
hard to make these predictions. That is definitely the familiar story now. Five years ago, it was every blue collar
job is up for destruction, maybe like last year it was. Every creative job is up for destruction
because of things like Jukebox I. I think there will be an
enormous impact on. The job market, and I really hate it, I think it's kind of gross when
people like working on I pretend like there's not going
to be or sort of say, oh, don't worry about it. It'll
just all obviously better. It doesn't always obviously get better.
I think what is true is. Every technological revolution
produces a change in jobs, we always find new ones, at least so far. It's difficult to predict from
where we're sitting now what the new ones will be and this
technological revolution is likely to be. Again, it's always tempting to
say this time it's different. Maybe I'll be totally wrong. But from what I see now, this
technological revolution is likely to be more. Dramatic. More of a
staccato note than most, and I think we as a society need to figure
out how we're going to cushion everybody through that. I've got my
own ideas about how to do that. I, I wouldn't say that I have any reason
to believe they're the right ones, but doing nothing and not
really engaging with the magnitude of what's about to happen, I think it's like not an
acceptable answer. So there's going to be huge impact. It's difficult to predict where
it shows up the most. I think previous predictions
have mostly been wrong, but I I'd like to see us all as a society,
certainly as a field, engage in what what the shifts
we want to make to the social contract are to kind
of get through that in a way that is maximally beneficial
to everybody. I mean, in every past revolution, there's always been a space
for humans to move to. That is, if you like, moving
up the food chain, it's sort of we've retreated to the things
that humans could uniquely do, think better, be more creative
and so forth. I guess the worry about A.I. is that
in principle, I believe this, that there is no human cognitive feat
that won't ultimately be doable, probably better by artificial
general touch, simply because of the extra firepower
that ultimately they can have, the vast knowledge they bring
to the table and so forth. Is that basically right, that there is
ultimately no safe sort of space where we can say, oh, but that would
never be able to do that on a very long time horizon? I agree with
you, but that's such a long time horizon. I think that, you know, like maybe
we've merged by that point, like maybe we're all plugged
in and then, like, we're this sort of symbiotic thing. Like, I think there's an
interesting example, as we were talking about
a few minutes ago, where right now we have these systems that
have sort of enormous horsepower but no steering wheel. It's like, you know
, incredible capabilities, but no judgment. And there's like these
obvious ways in which today even a human plus three is far better
than either on their own. Many people speak about a world
where it's sort of A.I. as this external threat you speak about. At some point, we actually merge
with eyes in some way. What do you mean by that? There's a lot of different versions of
what I think is possible there, you know, in some sense, I'd argue the merge
has already like begun the human technology merge like we have
this thing in our hands that sort of dictates a lot of what we think, but it gives us real superpowers and
that can go much, much further. Maybe it goes all the way to like the
Elon Musk vision of neuro link and having our brains plugged
into computers and sort of like literally we have a
computer on the back of our head or goes the other direction and
we get uploaded into one. Or maybe it's just that we all have a chat bot that kind of
constantly steers us and helps us make better decisions
than we could. But in any case, I think the fundamental
thing is it's not like the humans versus the eyes competing to be the. Smartest
sentient thing on earth or beyond. But it's that this idea of
being on the same team. Hmm. I certainly get very excited by the
sort of the medium term potential for creative people of all sorts if
they're willing to expand their palette of possibilities. But with the
use of A.I. to be willing to. I mean, the one thing that the history
of technology has shown again and again is that something this powerful
and with this much benefit is unstoppable and you will get rewarded for embracing
it the most and the earliest. So talk about what can go wrong with that, so let's move away from just the sort
of economic displacement factor. You were a co-founder of Open Eye because
you saw existential risks to humanity from high today. What
would you put as the sort of the most worrying of those risks? And
how is open eye working to minimize? I still think all of the really
horrifying risks exist. I am more confident, much
more confident than I was five years ago when we started that
there are technical things we can do about. How we build these systems
and the research and the alignment that make us much
more likely to end up in the kind of really wonderful camp, but,
you know, like maybe open I fall behind and maybe somebody else feels ajai that
thinks about it in a very different way or doesn't care as much as we'd like
about safety and the risks or how to strike a different trade off
of how fast we should go with this and where we should sort of
just say, like, you know, like let's push on for the
economic benefits. But I think all of this sort
of like, you know, traditionally what's been in the
realm of sci fi risks are real and we should not ignore them. And
I still lose sleep over them. And just to update people is artificial
general intelligence. Right now, we have incredible examples of
powerful AI operating on specific areas. Ajai is the ability of a computer
mind to connect the dots and to make decisions at the same level
of breadth that that humans have had. What's your sort of elevator pitch on
Ajai about how to identify and how to think of it? Yeah, I mean, the way that I would say it is that for a while we were in this world of like
very narrow A.I. , you know, that could like classify images of cats or
whatever, more advanced stuff in that. But that kind of thing. We are now in
the era of general purpose, AI, where you have these systems that are
still very much imperfect tools, but that can generalize. And one thing
like GPP three can write essays and translate between languages
and write computer code and do very complicated search. It's like a single model that understands
enough of what's really going on to do a broad array of tasks
and learn new things quickly, sort of like people can. And then
eventually we'll get to this other realm. Some people call it ajai, some
people call ostler things. But I think it implies that the systems
are like to some degree self directed, have some intentionality of their own is a simple summary to say that, like the fundamental risk is that there's the potential with general artificial
intelligence of a sort of runaway effect of
self-improvement that can happen far faster than any kind of humans
can even keep up with, so that the day after you get to ajai, suddenly computers are thousands
of times more advanced than us and we have no way of controlling
what they do with that power. Yeah, and that is certainly
in the risk space, which is that we build this thing and
at some point somewhat suddenly, it's much more powerful than we are, we
haven't really done the full merge yet. There's an event horizon there and
it's sort of hard to see to the other side of it. Again, lots of
reasons to think it will go OK. Lots of reasons to think we won't
even get to that scenario. But that is something that. I don't think people should brush under
the rug as much as they do, it's in the possibility space for sure, and in the possibility subspace
of that is one where, like, we didn't actually do as good of a job
on the alignment work as we thought. And this sort of child of
humanity kind of acts in a very different way than we think. A framework that I find useful is to sort
of think about like a two by two matrix, which is short timelines to ajai
and long timelines to ajai and a slow take off and a fast take
off on the other axis. And in the short timelines,
fast take off quadrant, which is not where I think
we're going to be. But if we get there, I think there's
a lot of scenarios in the direction that you are describing
that are worrisome. And we would want to spend a
lot of effort planning for. I mean, the fact that a computer could
start editing its own code and improving itself while we're asleep
and you wake up in the morning and it's got smarter, that is the start
of something super powerful and potentially scary. I have tremendous misgivings about letting
my system, not one we have today, but one that we might not have and too many more years start editing its
own code while we're not paying attention. I think that's the kind
of thing that is worth a great deal of societal discussion about,
you know, just because we can do that. Should we? Yes, because one of the things that's
that's been most shocking to you about the last few years has been just the
power of unintended consequences. It's like you don't have to have a belief that there's some
sort of waking up of of an alien intelligence that suddenly
decided it wants to wreak havoc on humans. That may never happen. What you can have is just incredible
power that goes amok. So a lot of people would argue that
what's happened in technology in the last few years is actually
an example of that. You know, social media companies created
these intelligences that were programmed to maximally harvest attention,
for example, for sure. And they understand this from that turned
out to be in some ways horrifying and extraordinarily damaging. Is that a meaningful sort of
canary in the coal mine saying, look out, humanity, this could be really dangerous? And how how on earth do you
protect against those kinds of unintended consequences? I think you raise a great
point in general, which is these systems don't have to wish
ill to humanity to cause ill just when you have, like, very powerful systems. I
mean, unintended consequences for sure. But another version of that is
and I think this applies at the technical level, at the company level,
at the societal level, incentives are superpower's. Charlie Munger had this thing on, which is incentives are so powerful that
if you can spend any time whatsoever working on the incentive system, that's what you should do before
you work on anything else. And I really believe that. And I think that applies to the
individual models we build and what their reward functions look like. I think it applies to society
in a big way, and I think it applies to our
corporate structure at open. I you know, we sort of observe that if
you have very well-meaning people, but they have this incentive to sort
of maximize attention harvesting and profit forever through
no one's ill intentions, that leads to a quite undesirable outcome. And so we set up opening is this thing
called a capped profit model specifically so that we don't have the system incentive
to just generate maximum value forever with an AGI that seems
like obviously quite broken. But even though we knew that was bad and even though we all like to think
of ourselves as good people, it took us a long time to figure
out the right structure, to figure out a charter that's
going to govern us and a set of incentives that we believe
will let us do our work. And kind of these we have these like
three elements that we talk about a lot research sort of engineering, development and deployment
policy and safety. Put those all together under a system
where you don't have to rely on. Anything but the natural
incentives to push in a direction that we hope will minimize the sort of negative unintended
consequences. So help me understand this, because this is I think this is confusing
to some people. So you started opening. I initially I think Elon Musk,
the co-founder, and there was a group of you and the argument was this technology
is too powerful to be left, developed in secret and to be left
developed purely by corporations who have whatever incentive they may have. We need a nonprofit that will develop
and share knowledge openly. First of all, just even
at that early stage, some people were confused about this. It was saying if this thing
is so dangerous, why on earth would you want to make it secrets even more available? Well, maybe giving the tools to that sort
of AI terrorist in his bedroom somewhere, I think I think we got misunderstood in
the way we were talking about that. We certainly don't think that the
right thing to do is to, like, build this a super weapon and hand it to
a terrorist. That's obviously awful. One of the reasons that we like our
API model is it lets us make the most powerful AI technology anyone
in the world has, as far as we know, available to ever would like to use it,
but to put some controls on its usage. And also, if we make a mistake, to be able to pull it back or change it
or tweak it or improve it or whatever. But we do want to put and this is
continued will continue to be true with appropriate restrictions and guardrails, very powerful technology in the hands
of people. I think that is fair. I think that will lead to the best results
for the society as a whole. And I think it will sort
of maximize benefit. But that's very different than sort of
shipping the whole model and saying, here, do whatever you want with it. We're
able to enforce rules on it. We also think and this is part of
the mission that like something the field was doing a lot of that we
didn't feel good about was sort of saying like, oh, we're going to keep the pace
of progress and capabilities secret. That doesn't feel right, because
I think we do need a societal conversation about
what's what's going on here, what the impacts are going to be. And so we although we don't always say,
like, you know, here's the super weapon, hopefully we do try to say, like, this is
really serious. This is a big deal. This is going to affect all of us. We need to have a big conversation
about what to do with it. Help me understand the structure
a bit better, because you definitely surprised much
people when you announced that Microsoft were putting a billion dollars into
the organization and in return, I guess they get certain exclusive
licensing rights. And so, for example, they are the
exclusive licensee of CP3. So talk about that structure
of how you win. Microsoft presumably have invested not
purely for altruistic purposes. They think that they will make money
on that billion dollars. I sure hope they do. I love capitalism, but I think that I really loved even
more about Microsoft as a partner. And I'll talk about the structure
and the exclusive license in a minute is that we like went around
to people that might find us. And we said one of the things here is that
we're going to try to make you some money. But like Adjei going
well is more important. And we need you to sign this document
that says if things don't go the way we think and we can't make you
money like you just cheerfully walk away from it and we do the right
thing for humanity. And they were like, yes, we are
enthusiastic about that. We get that the mission comes first here. So again, I hope a phenomenal
investment for them. But they were like they really
pleasantly surprised us on the upside of how aligned
they were with us, about how strange the world may get here
and the need for us to have flexibility and put our mission first, even if that
means they lose all their money, which I hope they don't and
don't think they will. So the way it's set up is that if at some
point in the coming year or two, two years, Microsoft decide that there's
some incredible commercial opportunity that they could realize out of the eye
that you've built and you feel actually, no, that's that's damaging. You
can block it. You can veto it. Correct. So the four most powerful
version of three and its successors are available
via the API, and we intend for that to continue. What Microsoft has is the ability to sort
of put that model directly into their own technology. If they want to do that. We don't plan to do that
with other people because we can't have all these controls
that we talked about earlier. But they're like a close trusted partner
and they really care about safety, too. But our goal is that anybody who
wants to use the API can have the most powerful versions
of what we've trained. And the structure of the API lets us
continue to increase the safety and fix problems when we find them.
But but the structure. So we start out as a non-profit,
as you said, we realized pretty quickly that although
we went into this thinking that the way to get to ajai would be about
smarter and smarter algorithms, that we just needed bigger and
bigger computers as well. And that was going to require a scale
of capital that no one will, at least certainly not me, could figure
out how to raise is a nonprofit. We also needed to sort of be able to
compensate very highly compensated, talented individuals that do this, but are full for profit company had
runaway incentives problem, among other things. Also just one about
sort of fairness in society and wealth concentration that didn't
feel right to us either. And so we came up with this kind
of hybrid where we have a nonprofit that governs what we do,
and it has a subsidiary, LLC, that we structure in a way to make
a fixed amount of profit so that all of our investors
and employees, hopefully if things go how we like,
if not no one gets any money, but hopefully they get to make this one
time great return on their investment or the time that they spent
it open their equity here. And then beyond that, all the value
flows back to the nonprofit and we figure out how to share it as
fairly as we can with the world. And I think that this structure and this nonprofit with this very
strong charter in place and everybody who joins signing up
for the mission come in first and the fact the world may get strange,
I think that. That was at least the best idea
we could come up with, and I think it feels so far like the
incentive system is working, just as I sort of watch the way that
we and our partners make decisions. But if I read it right, the cap on the gain that investors can make is
100 Axum. It's a massive call that was for our very first round investors.
It's way, way lower. Like as we now take a bit of capital,
it's way, way lower. So your deal with Microsoft
isn't you can only make the first hundred billion dollars.
I don't know. It's way lower than after that.
We're giving it to the world. It's way lower than that.
Have you disclosed what I don't know if we have, so
I won't accidentally do it now. All right. OK, so explain a bit more about
the charter and how it is that you. Hope to avoid or I guess help contribute
to an eye that is safe for humanity. What do you see as the keys to us
avoiding the worst mistakes and really holding on to something that's
that's beneficial for humanity? My answer there is actually more about, like technical and societal
issues than the charter. So if it's OK for me to answer it
from that perspective, sure. OK, I'm happy to talk about
the charter to. I think this question of alignment
that we talked about a little earlier is paramount, and then I think to understand that it's
useful to differentiate between accidental misuse of a system and
intentional misuse of a system. So like intentional would be a bad actor
saying, I've got this powerful system, I'm going to use it to like hack into
all the computers in the world and wreak havoc on the power grids. And accidental would be kind of the Nick
Bostrom make a lot of paper clips and view humans as collateral
damage in both cases. But to varying degrees, if
we can really, truly, technically solve the alignment
problem and the societal problem of deciding to which
set of human values do we align, then the systems understand
right and wrong, and they understand probably
better than we ever can, unintended consequences from complex
actions and very complex systems. And, you know, if we can train
a system which is like. Don't harm humanity and the system can
really understand what we mean when we say that, again, who is we and what does
that have some asterisks on them? Sorry, go ahead. Well, that's if they could understand
what it means to not harm humanity, that there's a lot wrapped
up in that sentence. Because what's been so striking
to me about efforts so far is that they seem
to have been based on a very naive view of human nature. Go back to the sort of Facebook
and Twitter examples of, well, the engineers building some of the systems would say we've just designed
them around what humans want to do. You said, well, if someone wants
to click on something, we will give them more of that thing. And
what could possibly be wrong with that? We're just supporting human choice, ignoring the fact that humans are
complicated, farshid animals for sure, who are constantly making choices, that a more effective version of
themselves would agree is not in their long term interests. So
that's one part of it. And then you've got layered
on top of that or the complications of systemic
complexity where, you know, multiple choices by thousands
of people end up creating a reality that possibly have designed
for how how to cut through that. Like an AI has to make a decision based
on a moment, on a specific data set. As those decisions get more powerful, how can we be confident that they don't
lead to this sort of system crashing basically in some way? I think that I've heard a lot
of behavioral psychologists and other people that have studied
this say in different ways, are that I hate to keep
picking on Facebook, but we can do it one more time
since we're on the topic. Maybe you can't in any given moment in
night where you're tired and you have a stressful day, stop yourself from
the dopamine hit of scrolling and Instagram, even though you
know that's bad for you and it's not leading to your best life. But if you were asked in a reflective
moment where you were sort of fully alert and thoughtful, do you want
to spend as much time as you do scrolling through Instagram?
Does it make you happier or not? You would actually be able to give
like the right long term answer? It's sort of the spirit is willing, but
the flesh is weak kind of moment. And one thing that I am hopeful is that
humans do know what we want and what. On the whole, and presented
with research or sort of an objective view about what makes us
happy and doesn't we're pretty, what's so great about it,
they're pretty good. But in any particular moment, we are subjected to our animal
instincts and it is easy for the lower brain to take over the eye. Well
, I think be an even higher brain. And as we can teach it, you know,
here is what we really do value. Here's what we really do want. It will help us make better decisions
than we are capable of, even in our best moments. So is that being proposed and talked
about as an actual rule? Because it strikes me that there is
something potentially super profound here to introduce some kind of rule for development of AIDS that
they have to tap into not. What humans one, which is
an ill defined question, but as to what humans in reflective mode
want. Yeah, we talk about this a lot. I mean, do you see a real chance where
something like that could be incorporated as a sort of an absolute golden
rule and and if you like, spread around the community so that it
seeps into corporations and elsewhere? Because that I've seen no
evidence that, well, a little corporation that was
potentially a game changer. Corporations have this weird
incentive problem. Right. What I was trying to speak
about was something that I think should be technologically possible
, and that's something that we
as a society should demand. And I think it is technically possible for
this to be sort of like a layer above the neocortex that makes even better
decisions for us and our welfare and our long term happiness and
fulfillment than we could make on our own. And I think it is possible
for us as a society to demand that. And if we can do like a pincer move
between what the technology is capable of and what we what we as society demand, maybe we can make everybody
in the middle that way. I mean, there are instances of even though
companies have their incentives to make money and so forth, they
also in the knowledge age. Can't make money if they have pissed
off too many of their employees and customers and investors by analogy
of the climate space right now, you can see more and more companies, even those that are emitting huge amounts
of carbon dioxide, saying, wait a sec, we're struggling to recruit talented
people because they don't want to work for someone who's evil. And their
customers are saying, we don't want to buy something
that is evil. And so, you know, ultimately you can
picture processes where they do better. And I I believe that most engineers, for
example, work in Silicon Valley. Companies are actually good people
who want to design great products for humanity. I think that the people
who run these companies want to be a net contribution to humanity. It's we've we've rushed really quickly and design stuff without thinking
it through properly. And it's led to a mess up. So it's like, OK, don't move fast,
break things, slow down and build beautiful
things that are built on a real version of human nature and on
a real version of system complexity and the risks associated with
systemic complexity. Is that the agenda that fundamentally
you think that you can push somehow? Yes, but I think the way we can push it is
by getting the incentive system right. I think most people are fundamentally
extremely good. Very few people wake up in the morning
thinking about how can I make the world a worse place? But the incentive systems
that we're in are so powerful. And even those engineers who join with the absolute best of intentions get sucked
into this world where they're like trying to go up from it all for and five
or whatever Facebook calls those things and you like, it's pretty exciting. You get caught up playing the game, you're rewarded for kind of doing things
that move the company's key metrics. It's like fun to get promoted. It feels good to make more money and the
incentive systems of the company. And that's what it rewards. An individual performance are maybe
like not what we all want. And here I don't want to pick
on Facebook at all because I think there's versions of this at play
it like every big tech company, including in some ways I'm
sure it open I but to the degree that we can better align
the incentives of companies with the welfare of society and
then the incentives of an individual at those companies within
the now realign incentives for those companies, the more likely we
are to be able to have things like ajai that. Follow an incentive system of. What we want in our most
reflective best moments and are even better than what
we could think of ourselves is is it still the vision for open
eye that you will get to? Artificial general intelligence ahead of. The corporations, so that you can somehow
put a stake in the ground and build it the right way. Is that really a realistic
thing to to dream for? And if not, how do you live
up to the mission and help ensure that this thing
doesn't go off the rails? I think it is. Look, I certainly don't
think we will be the only group to build an AGI, but I think we could be the first. And I think if you are the first, you
have a lot of norms that empower. And I think you've already seen that. You know, we have released some of the
most powerful systems to date. And I think the way that we have done that
kind of in controlled release where we've released a bigger model than
a bigger one than a bigger one, and we sort of try and talk about
the potential misuse cases and we try to like talk about the
importance of releasing this behind an API so that you can make changes. Other groups have followed suit
in some of those directions, and I think that's good. So, yes, I don't think we can be the only
I do think we can be ahead. And if we are ahead, I think we can use
that leverage to hopefully push people in a better direction or maybe we're
wrong and somebody else has a better direction. We're
doing something about do you have a structural advantage in
that your mission is to do this for everyone as opposed to for
some corporate objective. And that that that allows you that. Why is it that we came out of open
eye and not someone else? It's like it's surprising in some ways
when you're up against so much money and so much talent in these other
companies that you came up with this platform ahead of. You know, in some sense it's surprising
and in some sense, like the startup wins most of the time, like I'm a huge believer in
startups as the best force for innovation we have in the world today. I talked a little bit about how
we combine these three. Different clans of research, engineering and sort of safety and policy that don't normally combine
well and I think we have an unusual strength, there were
clearly like well funded. We have super talented people. But what we really have
is like intense focus and self belief that what we're
doing is possible and good. And I appreciate the implied compliment. But, you know, we, like, work really hard. And if we stop doing that, I'm sure
someone would run by us fast. Tell us a bit more about some of
your prior life sentences. Yeah, for several years, you
were running Y Combinator, which had incredible impact
on some 70 companies. There are so many startup stories
that began at Y Combinator. What were key drivers in your own life
that took you on the path you're on? And how did that path end
up at Y Combinator? No exaggeration. I think I have back to
back had the two jobs that are at least the most interesting to me
in all of Silicon Valley. I, I was I went to college to
study computer science. I was a major computer nerd growing up. I knew like a little bit about startups,
but not very much. I started working on this project the
same year I started working on that. This thing called Y Combinator started
and funded me and my co-founders. And we dropped out of school
and did this company, which I ran for like seven years. And
then after that I got acquired. I had stayed close to my
comment the whole time. I thought it was just this incredible
group of people and spirit and set of incentives and just badly
misunderstood by most of the world, but obvious to everyone within it that it
was going to create huge amounts of value and do a lot of new things. My company had acquired PJI,
who is the founder of ICI, and like truly one of the most incredible
humans and business people. And Paul Burrell, Paul Graham asked
me if I wanted to run it. And kind of like the central
learning of my career, why I individual startups has been
that if you really scale them up, remarkable things can happen. And I. I did it and I was like, one of the things
that would make this exciting for me personally motivating would
be if I could sort of push it in the direction of doing these hard tech
companies, one of which became open. I describe actually what Y Combinator is, you know, how many people come through it to give
us a couple of stories of its impact. Yeah. So you basically apply as a
handful of people and an idea, maybe a prototype and say, I would like to start a company
and will you please fund me? And we review those applications and
we I shouldn't say we anymore. I guess they fund four hundred
companies a year. You get about one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars while she takes about seven percent ownership and then gives you
lots of advice and then networking and sort of this like fast track
program for starting a startup. I haven't looked at this in a while, but at one point a significant
fraction of the billion dollar plus companies
in the US that got started. It all came through the Wiki program, some recently in the news ones have been
like Airbnb, Jordache, Coinbase, insta card stripe. And I think it's just
it has become an incredible way to help. People who understand technology get
a three month course in business, but instead of like herding
you with an MBA, we actually teach you the things that
matter and kind of go on to do incredible, incredible work. What is it about entrepreneurs?
Why do they matter? Some people just find them
kind of annoying. But I think you would argue I think
I would argue that they have done as much as anyone to shape the future. Why
? What is it about them? I think it is the ability to take. And idea and by force of will to make
it happen in the world and in an incentive system that rewards you
for making the most impact on the most people like in our system. That's how we get most of the
things that that we use. That's how we got the computer
that I'm using, the software I'm using
to talk to you on it. Like all of this, you know, everyone in
life, everything has a balance sheet. There's plenty of very annoying
things about them. And there's plenty of very
annoying things about the system that sort of idolizes them. But we do get something really
important in return. And I think that as a force for making things that make all of our
lives better happen, it's very cool. Otherwise, you know, like if you have,
like, a great idea, but you don't actually do anything useful
with it for people, that's still cool. It's still intellectually interesting. But like, there's got to
be something about the reward function in
society that is like, did you actually do something useful?
Did you create value? And I think entrepreneurship
and startups are a wonderful way to do that. You know, we
get all these great software companies. But I also think it's like how
we're going to get ajai, how we're going to get nuclear fusion, how
we're going to get life extension. And like on any of those topics are
a long list of other things I could point to. There's like
a number of startups that I think are doing incredible work, some
of which will actually deliver. It is a truly amazing thing when you put
the camera back and to believe that a human being could be
lying awake at night and something pops inside their
mind as a patterning of the neurons in their brain that is
effectively them saying, aha, I can see a way where the future
could be better and and they can actually picture it. And then they wake up and then they talk
to other people and they persuade them and they persuade investors and so forth. And the fact that this this
system can happen and that they can then actually change
the history changes in some sense. It is mind boggling that that happens that
way and it happens again and again. So you've seen so many of these stories
happen. What would you say? Is the is there a key thing that
differentiates good entrepreneurs from others? If you could double down
on one trait, what would it be? If I could pick only one, I
would pick determination. I think that is the biggest
predictor of success, the biggest differentiator predictor. And if you would allow a second, I would pick like communication
skills or evangelism or something in that direction as well. There are all of the obvious ones
that matter, like intelligence, but there's like a lot of smart
people in the world. And when I look back at kind of the thousands of entrepreneurs
I've worked with, all of many of whom were
like quite capable, I would say that's like one and two of the surprisingly differentiated
characteristics. What it's it's what I look at, the different things that you've
built and you're working on. I mean, it could not be more foundational
for the future. I mean, entrepreneurship. I know this is I agree that this is
really what has driven the future. Do you see some people get really now they
look at Silicon Valley and they look at this story and they worry
about the culture. Right. That it's this is a bro culture. Do you see prospects of that changing
anytime soon? And would you welcome it? Can we get better companies by
really working to expand a group of people who
can be entrepreneurs and who can contribute
to aid, for example? For sure. And in fact,
I think I'm hopeful, since these are the two things
I've thought the most about. I'm excited for the day when
someone combines them and uses A.I. to better select
who did more fairly, maybe even select who to fund
and how to advise them and really kind of make entrepreneurship
super widely available that will lead to like better outcomes and sort of more
societal wealth for all of us. So are. So, yeah, I think. Broadening the set of people able to start
companies and that sort of get the resources that you need, that is like an unequivocally good
thing and it's something that I think Silicon Valley is making some
progress in. But I hope we see a lot more. And I do really, truly think that the technology industry entrepreneurship
is one of the greatest forces for self betterment. If we can
just figure out how to be a little bit more inclusive
in how we do things. My last question today is about
ideas were spreading. If you could inject one idea into
the mind of everyone listening, what what would the idea be? We've touched on it a bunch, but the one idea would be the ajai
really is going to happen. You have to engage with it seriously, and you shouldn't just listen to this and
then brush aside and go about life as if it's not going to happen because
it is going to affect everything. And we will all we all, I think,
have an obligation, but also an opportunity to figure out what
not means and how we want the world and this sort of one time shift to go on. I'm kind of awed by the breadth
of things are engaged with. Thank you so much for spending so
much time sharing your vision. Thanks so much for having me. OK, that's it for today. You can

3,What is deep tech? A look at how it could shape the future,Antoine Gourévitch,Mar 2021,"How do companies like SpaceX make sudden breakthroughs on decades-old challenges? Emerging tech expert Antoine Gourévitch explains how deep tech -- a new approach to innovation that merges science, engineering and design thinking -- is unlocking solutions to problems in space exploration, biology, energy and more. As Gourévitch says: ""[deep tech] is changing what was once considered impossible into something actively possible, today.""", (42K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:01In this research lab, I discovered a story
that is swiftly changing our world. A story that has the power to change
the way we produce material, the way we eat and the way we heal. It is the story of deep tech. 00:22Deep tech is a new chapter
in the innovation story, bringing together science,
engineering and design thinking. Imagine if another global pandemic happens and the drug to combat it was developed and approved not in decades or years, but in months or even in weeks. Deep tech offers this potential. Imagine technologies like robotics, synthetic biology, nanomaterial, blockchain, quantum computing and many others -- when combined with each other and blended with engineering
and design science, are making what's seemingly
impossible possible. 01:16So what is deep tech? I've spent the last 18 months
visiting 100 research labs and start-ups from Shenzhen in China to Haifa in Israel, and this is what I learned
about deep tech ventures. They focus on fundamental issues, identifying physical constraints
of industries not solved for decades. For example, in energy, nuclear fusion; in mobility, air robotaxi. They work as a close hub
of emerging technologies. Like synthetic biology, quantum programming, artificial intelligence and many others, they focus on physical product
using data and digital platform to accelerate the test-and-run phase. They rely on an ecosystem
to accelerate the innovation cycle, including the build-and-test phase. Too many disciplines are necessary
to master for one venture to go alone. It is about cooperation, not competition. Deep tech is ultimately
transforming discovery into a design and engineering exercise. 02:45So ... why does it matter? It matters because it is happening now, all around us, ongoing. This approach is changing
what was once considered impossible into something actively possible today. 03:07Take SpaceX, a deep tech pioneer who disrupted the aerospace industry by producing reusable
rockets and spaceships, reducing the cost of going to space
by a factor of 10. They achieved this by combining
advanced materials and chemicals developed
in the last 20 years with vertical integration and the modular approach
of modern software engineering. 03:38Or PASQAL, the start-up founded by several students
of my friend, Alain Aspect, creatively using fundamental physics
combined with software engineering and data science to create an analog quantum processor. 03:54Or take Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks founded by internet pioneer Tom Knight
and a group of MIT scientists. A visit to Ginkgo showed me a lab
I had never seen before. I saw a fully automated bioworks lab with the latest robotic techniques, allowing to test thousands
of biological designs. They achieved this by building
the largest internal metagenomics database of cells, enzymes and genetic programming by combining robotics, protein design, both in microorganism and mammalian cells and data science. They have built
a cell programming platform able to create nearly
any organism they want by converging science, technology and data and digital platform then to become the Amazon
web services of biology, letting start-ups and other
companies use their facilities. This is a perfect example
of the ecosystem operating. 05:11So right now many of you may be thinking, how do we manage the technological risk? Will investors be ready
to play the deep tech game? Yes, there is a technological risk. And developing deep tech requires
to rethink our innovation approach. I have seen that four rules
govern successful deep tech ventures. 05:43Rule number one: be problem oriented, not technology focused. This is very important. Many deep tech ventures start
with a solution in search of a problem. Ginkgo partnered with Bayer
to solve the nitrogen fertilizer issue. Nitrogen is the most-used fertilizer
in the world today. But it produces three percent
of greenhouse gases and it pollutes water. Many start-ups today
are trying to solve this issue by applying their solutions. Ginkgo tried to solve it
by asking the question in another way: what if instead of producing nitrogen, we create a bacteria
that use existing nitrogen to fixate it on the roots of the plants, just like nature does? 06:41Rule number two: it is about combining,
intersecting, converging. So you need to bring
a cross-disciplinary team early on and play the ecosystem. What does that mean concretely? Take Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an energy venture focusing
on nuclear fusion. They achieved their breakthrough
in nuclear fusion by combining advances
in material and data science that enabled them to do
calculation and simulation that was simply not doable
a few years back. And they play the ecosystem very well. Corporates like ENI and Equinor
have invested early on. Universities like the MIT
Plasma Science and Fusion Centers are actively collaborating with them. VCs like Breakthrough
Energy Ventures and others, are supporting them, and the US government
seems interested in working with them. 07:49Rule number three: adopt a design thinking approach
powered by deep tech. Identify assumptions early on to be tested to reduce the risk up front. Get to a working prototype
as quickly as possible. Anticipate friction points
at each stage of the innovation cycle. Use a data and digital platform to reduce the cost of testing them. Lilium Aviation, a deep tech start-up
building all-electric air taxi, aiming at solving urban air mobility, has started by developing
a two-seater prototype, then a five-seater using
real-time data of every flight to design the next version. 08:40Rule number four: adopt a design-to-cost approach. Merging science with engineering
requires to have the economics in mind all the time. Zymergen, another synthetic biology lighthouse, whenever they design a product, use a ruthless design-to-cost approach. In the design phase, even before production starts, they look for the right products
at the right costs with the right parameters. Zymergen developed Hyaline a transparent, printable
circuit for electronics, produced by fermentation. And this biobased film is cheaper and has better properties
than the existing one, petroleum-based. 09:33Deep tech is maturing quickly now. In 2019, there were more
than 5,000 deep tech ventures fueled by 50 billion dollars
of investors and their money. Ventures coming out of research labs have the power to solve
our most pressing issues. Think what you would like
to grow in your world. Consider how might deep tech
help you cultivate that thing, maybe by accelerating a drug development or by eliminating greenhouse gases or perhaps by solving the congestion
problem plaguing your city. 10:22Deep tech is an ever-growing
opportunity in front of us, waiting to be scaled
for this world and more. It is the next chapter
in the innovation story, and today I invite all of you
to join me in its creation. 10:43Thank you."

at DeepMind in London had set their sights on a grand challenge. They wanted to create an AI system 
that could beat, not just a single Atari game, 
but every Atari game. They developed a system they called 
Deep Q Networks, or DQN, and less than two years later, 
it was superhuman. DQN was getting scores 13 times better than professional human games testers
at “Breakout,” 17 times better at “Boxing,” 
and 25 times better at “Video Pinball.” 00:48But there was one notable, and glaring,
exception. When playing “Montezuma’s Revenge” 
DQN couldn’t score a single point, even after playing for weeks. What was it that made this particular game
so vexingly difficult for AI? And what would it take to solve it? 01:10Spoiler alert: babies. We’ll come back to that in a minute. 01:16Playing Atari games with AI involves
what’s called reinforcement learning, where the system is designed to maximize
some kind of numerical rewards. In this case, those rewards were
simply the game's points. This underlying goal drives the system
to learn which buttons to press and when to press them 
to get the most points. Some systems use model-based approaches,
where they have a model of the environment that they can use to predict 
what will happen next once they take a certain action. DQN, however, is model free. Instead of explicitly modeling
its environment, it just learns to predict,
based on the images on screen, how many future points it can expect 
to earn by pressing different buttons. For instance, “if the ball is here 
and I move left, more points, but if I move right, no more points.” 02:12But learning these connections requires
a lot of trial and error. The DQN system would start
by mashing buttons randomly, and then slowly piece together 
which buttons to mash when in order to maximize its score. But in playing “Montezuma’s Revenge,” this approach of random button-mashing
fell flat on its face. A player would have to perform 
this entire sequence just to score their first points 
at the very end. A mistake? Game over. So how could DQN even know
it was on the right track? 02:47This is where babies come in. In studies, infants consistently look 
longer at pictures they haven’t seen before 
than ones they have. There just seems to be something
intrinsically rewarding about novelty. This behavior has been essential 
in understanding the infant mind. It also turned out to be the secret
to beating “Montezuma’s Revenge.” 03:12The DeepMind researchers worked 
out an ingenious way to plug this preference for novelty 
into reinforcement learning. They made it so that unusual or new images
appearing on the screen were every bit as rewarding
as real in-game points. Suddenly, DQN was behaving totally
differently from before. It wanted to explore the room it was in, to grab the key and escape 
through the locked door— not because it was worth 100 points, but for the same reason we would: 
to see what was on the other side. With this new drive, DQN not only
managed to grab that first key— it explored all the way through 15 
of the temple’s 24 chambers. 03:58But emphasizing novelty-based rewards 
can sometimes create more problems than it solves. A novelty-seeking system that’s played 
a game too long will eventually lose motivation. If it’s seen it all before, 
why go anywhere? Alternately, if it encounters, say, 
a television, it will freeze. The constant novel images
are essentially paralyzing. 04:23The ideas and inspiration here
go in both directions. AI researchers stuck 
on a practical problem, like how to get DQN to beat 
a difficult game, are turning increasingly to experts 
in human intelligence for ideas. At the same time, AI is giving us new insights
into the ways we get stuck and unstuck: into boredom, depression, and addiction, along with curiosity, creativity, 
and play."

that AI will create new jobs, so those who lose their jobs

the answer yet, right? So that was the reason why
I started Todai Robot Project, making an AI which passes
the entrance examination of the University of Tokyo, the top university in Japan. 01:39This is our Todai Robot. And, of course, the brain of the robot
is working in the remote server. It is now writing a 600-word essay on maritime trade in the 17th century. How does that sound? 02:02Why did I take the entrance exam
as its benchmark? Because I thought we had to study
the performance of AI in comparison to humans, especially on the skills and expertise which are believed
to be acquired only by humans and only through education. To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo, you have to pass
two different types of exams. The first one is
a national standardized test in multiple-choice style. You have to take seven subjects and achieve a high score -- I would say like an 85 percent
or more accuracy rate -- to be allowed to take
the second stage written test prepared by Todai. 02:54So let me first explain
how modern AI works, taking the ""Jeopardy!"" challenge
as an example. Here is a typical ""Jeopardy!"" question: ""Mozart's last symphony
shares its name with this planet."" Interestingly, a ""Jeopardy!""
question always asks, always ends with ""this"" something: ""this"" planet, ""this"" country, ""this"" rock musician, and so on. In other words, ""Jeopardy!"" doesn't ask
many different types of questions, but a single type, which we call ""factoid questions."" 03:36By the way, do you know the answer? If you do not know the answer
and if you want to know the answer, what would you do? You Google, right? Of course. Why not? But you have to pick appropriate keywords like ""Mozart,"" ""last""
and ""symphony"" to search. The machine basically does the same. Then this Wikipedia page
will be ranked top. Then the machine reads the page. No, uh-uh. 04:13Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs, including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot, is able to read. But they are very good
at searching and optimizing. It will recognize that the keywords ""Mozart,""
""last"" and ""symphony"" are appearing heavily around here. So if it can find a word which is a planet and which is co-occurring
with these keywords, that must be the answer. This is how Watson finds
the answer ""Jupiter,"" in this case. 04:56Our Todai Robot works similarly,
but a bit smarter in answering history yes-no questions, like, ""'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'
Is this sentence true or false?"" Our robot starts producing
a factoid question, like: ""Charlemagne repelled
[this person type]"" by itself. Then, ""Avars"" but not
""Magyars"" is ranked top. This sentence is likely to be false. Our robot does not read,
does not understand, but it is statistically
correct in many cases. 05:42For the second stage written test, it is required to write
a 600-word essay like this one: 05:49[Discuss the rise and fall
of the maritime trade in East and Southeast Asia
in the 17th century ...] 05:54and as I have shown earlier, our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia, combined them together, and optimized it to produce an essay without understanding a thing. 06:08(Laughter) 06:09But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay than most of the students. 06:16(Laughter) 06:18How about mathematics? A fully automatic math-solving machine has been a dream since the birth of the word
""artificial intelligence,"" but it has stayed at the level
of arithmetic for a long, long time. Last year, we finally succeeded
in developing a system which solved pre-university-level
problems from end to end, like this one. This is the original problem
written in Japanese, and we had to teach it
2,000 mathematical axioms and 8,000 Japanese words to make it accept the problems
written in natural language. And it is now translating
the original problems into machine-readable formulas. Weird, but it is now ready
to solve it, I think. Go and solve it. Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation. Even more weird, but probably this is the most
fun part for the machine. 07:38(Laughter) 07:40Now it outputs a perfect answer, though its proof is impossible to read,
even for mathematicians. Anyway, last year our robot
was among the top one percent in the second stage written
exam in mathematics. 08:02(Applause) 08:06Thank you. 08:07So, did it enter Todai? No, not as I expected. Why? Because it doesn't understand any meaning. Let me show you a typical error
it made in the English test. 08:24[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.
Just a few more minutes. Sunil: Wait. ______ .
Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...] 08:30Two people are talking. For us, who can understand
the situation -- 08:33[1. ""We walked for a long time.""
2. ""We're almost there."" 3. ""Your shoes look expensive.""
4. ""Your shoelace is untied.""] 08:39it is obvious number four
is the correct answer, right? But Todai Robot chose number two, even after learning 15 billion
English sentences using deep learning technologies. OK, so now you might
understand what I said: modern AIs do not read, do not understand. They only disguise as if they do. 09:12This is the distribution graph of half a million students
who took the same exam as Todai Robot. Now our Todai Robot
is among the top 20 percent, and it was capable to pass more than 60 percent
of the universities in Japan -- but not Todai. But see how it is beyond the volume zone of to-be white-collar workers. 09:48You might think I was delighted. After all, my robot was surpassing
students everywhere. Instead, I was alarmed. How on earth could this unintelligent
machine outperform students -- our children? Right? I decided to investigate
what was going on in the human world. I took hundreds of sentences
from high school textbooks and made easy multiple-choice quizzes, and asked thousands
of high school students to answer. 10:30Here is an example: 10:31[Buddhism spread to ... ,
Christianity to ... and Oceania, and Islam to ...] 10:35Of course, the original problems
are written in Japanese, their mother tongue. 10:39[ ______ has spread to Oceania. 1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
3. Islam 4. Buddhism ] 10:43Obviously, Christianity
is the answer, isn't it? It's written! And Todai Robot chose
the correct answer, too. But one-third of junior
high school students failed to answer this question. Do you think it is only the case in Japan? I do not think so, because Japan is always ranked
among the top in OECD PISA tests, measuring 15-year-old
students' performance in mathematics, science and reading every three years. 11:27We have been believing that everybody can learn and learn well, as long as we provide
good learning materials free on the web so that they can access
through the internet. But such wonderful materials
may benefit only those who can read well, and the percentage
of those who can read well may be much less than we expected. How we humans will coexist with AI is something we have
to think about carefully, based on solid evidence. At the same time,
we have to think in a hurry because time is running out. 12:16Thank you. 12:17(Applause) 12:22Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you. 12:24Noriko Arai: Thank you. 12:26CA: In your talk, you so beautifully
give us a sense of how AIs think, what they can do amazingly and what they can't do. But -- do I read you right, that you think we really need
quite an urgent revolution in education to help kids do the things
that humans can do better than AIs? 12:45NA: Yes, yes, yes. Because we humans
can understand the meaning. That is something
which is very, very lacking in AI. But most of the students
just pack the knowledge without understanding
the meaning of the knowledge, so that is not knowledge,
that is just memorizing, and AI can do the same thing. So we have to think about
a new type of education. 13:13CA: A shift from knowledge,
rote knowledge, to meaning. 13:16NA: Mm-hmm. 13:17CA: Well, there's a challenge
for the educators. Thank you so much. 13:21NA: Thank you very much. Thank you. 13:22(Applause)"

Guy Hoffman shows demo film of his family of unusual robots -- including two musical bots that like to jam with humans.", (92K),"Transcript (29 Languages)Azərbaycan diliDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00My job is to design, build and study
robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics
at all, it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's ""Luxo Jr.,"" I was amazed by how much
emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean, look at them --
at the end of this movie, you actually feel something
for two pieces of furniture. 00:22(Laughter) 00:23And I said, I have
to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision. 00:28(Laughter) 00:29And that's what my mom
was like when I did it. 00:31(Laughter) 00:33I left a very cozy tech job in Israel
at a nice software company and I moved to New York
to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building
in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase
metaphorically -- the ceiling actually collapsed
one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories
about building violations in New York, they would put the report
in front of our building, as kind of, like, a backdrop
to show how bad things are. 00:56Anyway, during the day, I went to school and at night I would sit and draw
frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that
when you want to arouse emotions, it doesn't matter so much
how something looks; it's all in the motion, in the timing
of how the thing moves. And the second was something
one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in ""Ice Age."" And he said, ""As an animator,
you're not a director -- you're an actor."" So, if you want to find
the right motion for a character, don't think about it --
go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror,
act it out in front of a camera -- whatever you need -- and then
put it back in your character. 01:36A year later I found myself at MIT
in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups
researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream
to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move
at all in this engaging way that I was used to
from my animation studies. Instead, they were all --
how should I put it -- they were all kind of robotic. (Laughter) And I thought, what if I took
whatever I learned in animation school, and used that to design
my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful
and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot
interacting with me on a desktop -- and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own
grave by helping me. 02:22(Laughter) 02:24I wanted it to be less of a mechanical
structure giving me light, and more of a helpful,
kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it
and doesn't really interfere. And when, for example, I'm looking
for a battery that I can't find, in a subtle way, it'll show me
where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice
how the same mechanical structure can, at one point,
just by the way it moves, seem gentle and caring
and in the other case, seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure,
just the motion is different. Actor: ""You want to know something?
Well, you want to know something? He was already dead! Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"" 03:17(Laughter) 03:18But, moving in a graceful way
is just one building block of this whole structure
called human-robot interaction. I was, at the time, doing my PhD,
I was working on human-robot teamwork, teams of humans and robots
working together. I was studying the engineering, the psychology,
the philosophy of teamwork, and at the same time, I found myself in my own kind
of teamwork situation, with a good friend of mine,
who's actually here. And in that situation,
we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up
a lot of folding chairs, and I was amazed at how quickly
we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part,
we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate
verbally about this -- it all just happened. 03:57And I thought, humans and robots
don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact,
it's much more like a chess game: the human does a thing, the robot
analyzes whatever the human did, the robot decides what to do next,
plans it and does it. Then the human waits,
until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game,
and that makes sense, because chess is great for mathematicians
and computer scientists. It's all about information, analysis,
decision-making and planning. 04:21But I wanted my robot
to be less of a chess player, and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second
horrible career choice: I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD,
I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play -- I hope there’s no video
of that around still. 04:42(Laughter) 04:43And I got every book
I could find about acting, including one from the 19th century
that I got from the library. And I was really amazed, because my name
was the second name on the list -- the previous name was in 1889. 04:54(Laughter) 04:55And this book was
kind of waiting for 100 years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion
that they want to express. 05:06But the real revelation was
when I learned about method acting. It became very popular
in the 20th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan
every muscle in your body; instead, you have to use your body
to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory
to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body
to find the right expression -- improvise, play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend
in cognitive psychology, called embodied cognition,
which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think; we don't just think with our brains
and use our bodies to move, but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. 05:43And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office, I wrote this paper,
which I never really published, called ""Acting Lessons
for Artificial Intelligence."" And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw
before with the actors. And I thought: How can we make an artificial
intelligence model -- a computer, computational model -- that will model some of these
ideas of improvisation, of taking risks, of taking chances, even of making mistakes? Maybe it can make for better
robotic teammates. So I worked for quite
a long time on these models and I implemented them
on a number of robots. 06:20Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use
this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements
as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych
it out, it gets fooled. And it's a little bit
like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then, I did another experiment, and I got people off the street
to use the robotic desk lamp, and try out this idea
of embodied artificial intelligence. So, I actually used two kinds
of brains for the same robot. 07:00The robot is the same lamp that you saw, and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people, I put in a brain
that's kind of the traditional, calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn,
it analyzes everything, it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage
actor, risk-taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing
everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes
and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task
that took almost 20 minutes, and they had to work together, somehow simulating, like, a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people
actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent, more committed,
a better member of the team, contributed to the success
of the team more. They even called it ""he"" and ""she,"" whereas people with the calculated brain called it ""it,"" and nobody
ever called it ""he"" or ""she."" When they talked about it after the task,
with the adventurous brain, they said, ""By the end, we were good
friends and high-fived mentally."" Whatever that means. 08:00(Laughter) 08:02Sounds painful. Whereas the people
with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed
to do and nothing more, which is almost what people
expect robots to do, so I was surprised that people
had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics
thought robots should be doing. And in a way, I thought,
maybe it's time -- just like method acting
changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century, from going from the very calculated,
planned way of behaving, to a more intuitive, risk-taking,
embodied way of behaving -- maybe it's time for robots
to have the same kind of revolution. 08:39A few years later, I was at my next
research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and I was working in a group
dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought, music:
that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination,
timing, improvisation -- and we just got this robot
playing marimba. And the marimba, for everybody like me, it was this huge, wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this, I looked at other works
in human-robot improvisation -- yes, there are other works
in human-robot improvisation -- and they were also a little bit
like a chess game. The human would play, the robot analyzed what was played, and would improvise their own part. So, this is what musicians called
a call-and-response interaction, and it also fits very well
robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought, if I use the same ideas
I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies, maybe I can make the robots
jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other,
nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same
things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know
what it's about to play, it just sort of moves its body
and uses opportunities to play, and does what my jazz teacher
when I was 17 taught me. She said, when you improvise, sometimes you don't know
what you're doing, and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't
actually know what it's doing, but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds
from this performance, where the robot listens
to the human musician and improvises. And then, look how the human
musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior, and at some point can even be surprised
by what the robot came up with. 10:13(Music) 10:55(Music ends) 10:59(Applause) 11:04Being a musician
is not just about making notes, otherwise nobody
would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate
with their bodies, with other band members,
with the audience, they use their bodies
to express the music. And I thought, we already have
a robot musician on stage, why not make it be
a full-fledged musician? And I started designing
a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn’t actually
touch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches
from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously
located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent, I would say, on average,
three to four hours a day there. I think. 11:41(Laughter) 11:42And I went back to my animation
tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic
musician would look like, but especially what a robotic
musician would move like, to sort of show that it doesn't like
what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat
it's feeling at the moment. 11:58So we ended up actually getting the money
to build this robot, which was nice. I'm going to show you now
the same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense
that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo. 12:20(Music) 12:24Now it's looking at me,
showing that it's listening. 12:27(Music) 12:49Now look at the final chord
of the piece again. And this time the robot
communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing, and when it's ready to coordinate
the final chord with me. 13:02(Music) 13:09(Music ending) 13:14(Final chord) 13:15(Applause) 13:20Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body
that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps
with the musical performance. And at some point -- we are in Atlanta, so obviously some rapper
will come into our lab at some point -- and we had this rapper come in and do
a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot
basically responding to the beat. Notice two things: one, how irresistible it is to join
the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move
your own head when it does it. And second, even though the rapper
is really focused on his iPhone, as soon as the robot turns
to him, he turns back. So even though it's just
in the periphery of his vision, in the corner of his eye,
it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem -- maybe your partner is looking
at their iPhone or smartphone too much -- you might want to have a robot
there to get their attention. 14:18(Laughter) 14:19(Music) 14:34(Music ends) 14:38(Applause) 14:45Just to introduce the last robot
that we've worked on, it came out of something
surprising that we found: Some point people didn't care
about the robot being intelligent, able to improvise and listen, and do all these embodied intelligence
things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot
was enjoying the music. 15:03(Laughter) 15:04And they didn't say the robot
was moving to the music, they said ""enjoying"" the music. And we thought,
why don't we take this idea, and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp,
it was a speaker dock, one of those things
you plug your smartphone in. And I thought, what would happen if your speaker dock
didn't just play the music for you, but would actually enjoy it, too? And so again, here are some
animation tests from an early stage. 15:29(Laughter) 15:31And this is what the final
product looked like. 15:46(Music) 16:06(Music ends) 16:09So, a lot of bobbing heads. 16:12(Applause) 16:15A lot of bobbing heads in the audience, so we can still see
robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games. 16:23I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use
their body to communicate and use their body to move is -- I'm going to let you in on a little
secret we roboticists are hiding -- is that every one of you
is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future,
there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours, your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent,
more engaging, more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots
need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors
and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able
to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able
to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able
to make mistakes and correct them, because in the end, we are human. And maybe as humans,
robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us. 17:11Thank you. 17:12(Applause)"

In a passionate talk, Rushkoff urges us to stop using technology to optimize people for the market and start using it to build a future centered on our pre-digital values of connection, creativity and respect. ""Join 'Team Human.' Find the others,"" he says.

a couple of hundred tech executives. And I was there in the green room,
waiting to go on, and instead of bringing me to the stage,
they brought five men into the green room who sat around this little table with me. They were tech billionaires. And they started peppering me
with these really binary questions, like: Bitcoin or Etherium? Virtual reality or augmented reality? I don't know if they were
taking bets or what. And as they got more comfortable with me, they edged towards
their real question of concern. Alaska or New Zealand? 00:45That's right. These tech billionaires
were asking a media theorist for advice on where to put their doomsday bunkers. We spent the rest of the hour
on the single question: ""How do I maintain control
of my security staff after the event?"" By ""the event"" they mean
the thermonuclear war or climate catastrophe or social unrest
that ends the world as we know it, and more importantly,
makes their money obsolete. And I couldn't help but think: these are the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world, yet they see themselves as utterly
powerless to influence the future. The best they can do is hang on
for the inevitable catastrophe and then use their technology and money
to get away from the rest of us. And these are the winners
of the digital economy. 01:38(Laughter) 01:41footnotefootnoteThe digital renaissance was about the unbridled potential of the collective human imagination. It spanned everything
from chaos math and quantum physics to fantasy role-playing
and the Gaia hypothesis, right? We believed that human beings connected
could create any future we could imagine. And then came the dot com boom. And the digital future
became stock futures. And we used all that energy
of the digital age to pump steroids into the already dying
NASDAQ stock exchange. The tech magazines told us
a tsunami was coming. And only the investors who hired
the best scenario-planners and futurists would be able to survive the wave. 02:35footnotefootnoteAnd so the future changed from this thing
we create together in the present to something we bet on in some kind of a zero-sum
winner-takes-all competition. And when things get that competitive
about the future, humans are no longer valued
for our creativity. No, now we're just valued for our data. Because they can use the data
to make predictions. Creativity, if anything,
that creates noise. That makes it harder to predict. 03:05footnotefootnoteSo we ended up with a digital landscape that really repressed creativity,
repressed novelty, it repressed what makes us most human. We ended up with social media. Does social media really connect people
in new, interesting ways? No, social media is about using our data
to predict our future behavior. Or when necessary,
to influence our future behavior so that we act more in accordance
with our statistical profiles. The digital economy --
does it like people? No, if you have a business plan,
what are you supposed to do? Get rid of all the people. Human beings, they want health care,
they want money, they want meaning. You can't scale with people. 03:47(Laughter) 03:48footnotefootnoteEven our digital apps -- they don't help us
form any rapport or solidarity. I mean, where's the button
on the ride hailing app for the drivers to talk to one another
about their working conditions or to unionize? Even our videoconferencing tools, they don't allow us
to establish real rapport. However good the resolution of the video, you still can't see if somebody's irises
are opening to really take you in. All of the things that we've done
to establish rapport that we've developed over hundreds
of thousands of years of evolution, they don't work, you can't see if someone's breath
is syncing up with yours. So the mirror neurons never fire,
the oxytocin never goes through your body, you never have that experience
of bonding with the other human being. And instead, you're left like, ""Well, they agreed with me,
but did they really, did they really get me?"" And we don't blame the technology
for that lack of fidelity. We blame the other person. 04:43You know, even the technologies
and the digital initiatives that we have to promote humans, are intensely anti-human at the core. Think about the blockchain. The blockchain is here to help us
have a great humanized economy? No. The blockchain does not engender
trust between users, the blockchain simply
substitutes for trust in a new, even less transparent way. 05:09footnotefootnoteOr the code movement. I mean, education is great,
we love education, and it's a wonderful idea that we want kids to be able
to get jobs in the digital future, so we'll teach them code now. But since when is education
about getting jobs? Education wasn't about getting jobs. Education was compensation
for a job well done. The idea of public education was for coal miners,
who would work in the coal mines all day, then they'd come home
and they should have the dignity to be able to read a novel
and understand it. Or the intelligence to be able
to participate in democracy. When we make it an extension of the job,
what are we really doing? We're just letting corporations really externalize the cost
of training their workers. 05:53footnotefootnoteAnd the worst of all really
is the humane technology movement. I mean, I love these guys,
the former guys who used to take the algorithms from
Las Vegas slot machines and put them in our social media feed
so that we get addicted. Now they've seen the error of their ways and they want to make
technology more humane. But when I hear the expression
""humane technology,"" I think about cage-free
chickens or something. We're going to be as humane
as possible to them, until we take them to the slaughter. So now they're going to let these
technologies be as humane as possible, as long as they extract enough data
and extract enough money from us to please their shareholders. Meanwhile, the shareholders,
for their part, they're just thinking, ""I need to earn enough money now,
so I can insulate myself from the world I'm creating
by earning money in this way."" 06:39(Laughter) 06:42No matter how many VR goggles
they slap on their faces and whatever fantasy world they go into, they can't externalize the slavery
and pollution that was caused through the manufacture
of the very device. 06:55footnotefootnoteIt reminds me of
Thomas Jefferson's dumbwaiter. Now, we like to think
that he made the dumbwaiter in order to spare his slaves
all that labor of carrying the food up to the dining room
for the people to eat. That's not what it was for,
it wasn't for the slaves, it was for Thomas Jefferson
and his dinner guests, so they didn't have to see the slave
bringing the food up. The food just arrived magically, like it was coming out
of a ""Start Trek"" replicator. It's part of an ethos that says, human beings are the problem
and technology is the solution. 07:28We can't think that way anymore. We have to stop using technology
to optimize human beings for the market and start optimizing technology
for the human future. But that's a really hard argument
to make these days, because humans are not popular beings. I talked about this in front
of an environmentalist just the other day, and she said, ""Why are you
defending humans? Humans destroyed the planet.
They deserve to go extinct."" 07:58(Laughter) 08:01Even our popular media hates humans. Watch television, all the sci-fi shows are about how robots
are better and nicer than people. Even zombie shows --
what is every zombie show about? Some person, looking at the horizon
at some zombie going by, and they zoom in on the person
and you see the person's face, and you know what they're thinking: ""What's really the difference
between that zombie and me? He walks, I walk. He eats, I eat. He kills, I kill."" But he's a zombie. At least you're aware of it. If we are actually having trouble
distinguishing ourselves from zombies, we have a pretty big problem going on. 08:39(Laughter) 08:40footnotefootnoteAnd don't even get me started
on the transhumanists. I was on a panel with a transhumanist,
and he's going on about the singularity. ""Oh, the day is going to come really soon
when computers are smarter than people. And the only option
for people at that point is to pass the evolutionary torch
to our successor and fade into the background. Maybe at best, upload
your consciousness to a silicon chip. And accept your extinction."" 09:04(Laughter) 09:06footnotefootnoteAnd I said, ""No, human beings are special. We can embrace ambiguity,
we understand paradox, we're conscious,
we're weird, we're quirky. There should be a place for humans
in the digital future."" And he said, ""Oh, Rushkoff, you're just saying that
because you're a human."" 09:22(Laughter) 09:24As if it's hubris. OK, I'm on ""Team Human."" That was the original insight
of the digital age. That being human is a team sport, evolution's a collaborative act. 09:40footnotefootnoteEven the trees in the forest, they're not all in competition
with each other, they're connected with the vast
network of roots and mushrooms that let them communicate with one another
and pass nutrients back and forth. If human beings
are the most evolved species, it's because we have the most evolved
ways of collaborating and communicating. We have language. We have technology. 10:02It's funny, I used to be the guy
who talked about the digital future for people who hadn't yet
experienced anything digital. And now I feel like I'm the last guy who remembers what life was like
before digital technology. It's not a matter of rejecting the digital
or rejecting the technological. It's a matter of retrieving the values
that we're in danger of leaving behind and then embedding them in the digital
infrastructure for the future. 10:29footnotefootnoteAnd that's not rocket science. It's as simple as making a social network that instead of teaching us
to see people as adversaries, it teaches us to see
our adversaries as people. It means creating an economy
that doesn't favor a platform monopoly that wants to extract all the value
out of people and places, but one that promotes the circulation
of value through a community and allows us to establish
platform cooperatives that distribute ownership
as wide as possible. It means building platforms that don't repress our creativity
and novelty in the name of prediction but actually promote
creativity and novelty, so that we can come up
with some of the solutions to actually get ourselves
out of the mess that we're in. 11:15No, instead of trying to earn
enough money to insulate ourselves from the world we're creating, why don't we spend that time and energy
making the world a place that we don't feel
the need to escape from. 11:26There is no escape,
there is only one thing going on here. Please, don't leave. Join us. We may not be perfect, but whatever happens,
at least you won't be alone. Join ""Team Human."" Find the others. Together, let's make the future
that we always wanted. Oh, and those tech billionaires
who wanted to know how to maintain control of their
security force after the apocalypse, you know what I told them? ""Start treating those people
with love and respect right now. Maybe you won't have
an apocalypse to worry about."" 12:04Thank you. 12:06(Applause)"
3,A future with fewer cars,Freeman H. Shen,Aug 2021,"What if your car could drop you off and then find parking by itself? According to electric vehicle entrepreneur Freeman H. Shen, this technology already exists. He shares his vision for a future where AI-powered electric vehicles will solve many of the problems cars currently cause, like smog, traffic congestion, accidents and, yes, endlessly circling the block looking for somewhere to park.", (51K),"Transcript (12 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolItalianoPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtРусскийעבריתالعربيةکوردی سۆرانی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00I love cars. I really do. But what we are currently doing
is a bit insane. Cars put smog in the air, create traffic and congestion and cause accidents. This might seem like
a crazy thing for me to say, but I am hoping for a future
with fewer cars, mostly smart EVs
and cars that can do more for us. 00:26Some of the biggest changes
that ever took place in the auto industry are happening right now,
affecting not only the cars, but the very fabric of the cities
in which we live. Governments across the world
are committing to change the way we move, and EVs are at the center of this change. Today, most of the cars powered by engine
or battery are not truly smart vehicles. Only smart EVs are computers on wheels. They not only connect vehicles,
but more importantly, use a lot of technology,
including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, big data,
cloud and agile computing, 5G connectivity and highly efficient e-powertrain, etc. These technologies are creating
cars that can talk to us and the world around them, and act accordingly. This will have a huge impact on our cities
and the way we live in them. 01:33Let's start with something that's always
a challenge in a city: parking. The reality is that cars are parked
nearly all of the time, taking space in our cities, costing us money. But right now, technology that allows your car to drop
you off and then go park itself exists. My company, with our partners, has created
an autonomous valet parking system which will be powerful enough
to allow you to step out of your car and leave it to park itself
hundreds of meters away. This technology is real.
It's already in our production car. In the near future, your car will be able
to book a space beforehand, and it doesn't take up room
and cause traffic jams looking for one, simply by talking to the parking lot. When full autonomy becomes the norm
in just five to 10 years, the car won't even need to park. It will be driving other people around
on a car-sharing platform, plugging itself into the grid
to charge when needed. When this is the case, we don't need
so many cars on the road. Access to cars will be
prioritized over ownership, and this will be great for cities. 02:46In my vision of future mobility, autonomy will reduce congestion and necessary infrastructure, creating more room
for better-looking, greener spaces. Imagine a shopping center
next to a huge playground for our kids, instead of miles of concrete
and cars lined up in the sun. And what about all those
roads and bridges and signage that carry us through a city? That will, of course, change, too. Autonomous cars will be designed
to read the environment around them, knowing the best routes and guiding passengers
to their destination with less congestion. We won't need signs for one-way streets or pedestrian crossings or how to get to the bridge or when not to take a left turn. Imagine an intersection
between two busy roads that has no traffic lights. Cars will speed up
and slow down automatically to avoid other cars in the intersection. The sky above the road
will be clear and open. 03:50In the auto industry, the ability for vehicles
to interact with their environment while taking data from essential
storage in the cloud about roads and navigation is called V2X or ""vehicle-to-everything."" V2X is what needs to happen in order for us to take
the final steps toward a city where cars can drive themselves, because it is at that point
that our vehicle will hold everything us humans need in order to drive
at an even greater scale and definitely more safely. The number of cars with V2X capabilities
is growing rapidly around the world, and especially in China. In Wuxi, a city of 6.5 million people
in China's Jiangsu province, there are already experiments
with V2X in autonomous driving. Around 220 square kilometers
of the central city is designed for V2X, with over 40 assistance-driving solutions. You will see traffic lights automatically
adjust to green for ambulances as they approach intersections. Cameras spot pedestrians on the road and deliver a warning directly to the cars
if they are approaching too quickly. Smart EVs can also receive alerts
about unexpected situations, such as nearby construction sites,
accidents, traffic jams or emergency vehicles. 05:29And with this comes massive
implications for safety. Imagine someone is having
a medical emergency. Today, getting yourself or someone else
to a hospital in a hurry can put you and others in danger. A car can only tell you
the best routes to the hospital. In the future, the car will be able to send
the medical information ahead of time to the hospital, allowing them to prepare corresponding
medical equipment in advance. The car could signal to the city
that it has a sick person on board, and the whole city can respond, making traffic lights green the whole way, clearing bus lanes and letting the medical response teams
automatically tie into the car through the connecting systems. This new era where our cars talk
to the world and the world talks back will dramatically change us, our mobility and our cities. I believe we'll have
fewer cars on the road, but we'll get where we need to go
more efficiently, safely and with more fun green space
and blue skies along the way. 06:42Thank you."
3,Don't fear intelligent machines. Work with them,Garry Kasparov,May 2017,"We must face our fears if we want to get the most out of technology -- and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of humanity, says Garry Kasparov. One of the greatest chess players in history, Kasparov lost a memorable match to IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in 1997.

Earlier that year, I played what is called
simultaneous exhibition against 32 of the world's
best chess-playing machines in Hamburg, Germany. I won all the games, and then it was not considered
much of a surprise that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time. To me, that was the golden age. 00:37(Laughter) 00:39Machines were weak, and my hair was strong. 00:43(Laughter) 00:46Just 12 years later, I was fighting for my life
against just one computer in a match called by the cover of ""Newsweek"" ""The Brain's Last Stand."" No pressure. 01:00(Laughter) 01:03From mythology to science fiction, human versus machine has been often portrayed
as a matter of life and death. John Henry, called the steel-driving man in the 19th century
African American folk legend, was pitted in a race against a steam-powered hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock. John Henry's legend
is a part of a long historical narrative pitting humanity versus technology. And this competitive rhetoric
is standard now. We are in a race against the machines, in a fight or even in a war. Jobs are being killed off. People are being replaced
as if they had vanished from the Earth. It's enough to think that the movies
like ""The Terminator"" or ""The Matrix"" are nonfiction. 01:59There are very few instances of an arena where the human body and mind
can compete on equal terms with a computer or a robot. Actually, I wish there were a few more. Instead, it was my blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about. In the most famous human-machine
competition since John Henry, I played two matches against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue. Nobody remembers
that I won the first match -- 02:49(Laughter) 02:51(Applause) 02:55In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch
the following year in New York. But I guess that's fair. There is no day in history,
special calendar entry for all the people
who failed to climb Mt. Everest before Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top. And in 1997, I was still
the world champion when chess computers finally came of age. I was Mt. Everest, and Deep Blue reached the summit. I should say of course,
not that Deep Blue did it, but its human creators -- Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu. Hats off to them. As always, machine's triumph
was a human triumph, something we tend to forget when humans
are surpassed by our own creations. 03:58Deep Blue was victorious, but was it intelligent? No, no it wasn't, at least not in the way Alan Turing
and other founders of computer science had hoped. It turned out that chess
could be crunched by brute force, once hardware got fast enough and algorithms got smart enough. Although by the definition of the output, grandmaster-level chess, Deep Blue was intelligent. But even at the incredible speed, 200 million positions per second, Deep Blue's method provided little of the dreamed-of insight
into the mysteries of human intelligence. 04:56Soon, machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors, but will they be ""intelligent?"" I would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the dictionary. What really matters is how we humans feel about living and working
with these machines. 05:26When I first met Deep Blue
in 1996 in February, I had been the world champion
for more than 10 years, and I had played 182
world championship games and hundreds of games against
other top players in other competitions. I knew what to expect from my opponents and what to expect from myself. I was used to measure their moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language
and looking into their eyes. 06:05And then I sat across
the chessboard from Deep Blue. I immediately sensed something new, something unsettling. You might experience a similar feeling the first time you ride
in a driverless car or the first time your new computer
manager issues an order at work. But when I sat at that first game, I couldn't be sure what is this thing capable of. Technology can advance in leaps,
and IBM had invested heavily. I lost that game. And I couldn't help wondering, might it be invincible? Was my beloved game of chess over? These were human doubts, human fears, and the only thing I knew for sure was that my opponent Deep Blue
had no such worries at all. 07:10(Laughter) 07:13I fought back after this devastating blow to win the first match, but the writing was on the wall. I eventually lost to the machine but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry who won but died
with his hammer in his hand. [John Henry Died with a Hammer in His Hand
Palmer C. Hayden] [The Museum of African
American Art, Los Angeles] It turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have
a human chess champion. And even today, when a free chess app
on the latest mobile phone is stronger than Deep Blue, people are still playing chess, even more than ever before. Doomsayers predicted
that nobody would touch the game that could be conquered by the machine, and they were wrong, proven wrong, but doomsaying has always been
a popular pastime when it comes to technology. 08:14What I learned from my own experience is that we must face our fears if we want to get the most
out of our technology, and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best
out of our humanity. While licking my wounds, I got a lot of inspiration from my battles against Deep Blue. As the old Russian saying goes,
if you can't beat them, join them. Then I thought, what if I could play with a computer -- together with a computer at my side,
combining our strengths, human intuition
plus machine's calculation, human strategy, machine tactics, human experience, machine's memory. Could it be the perfect game ever played? 09:10My idea came to life in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess when I played this human-plus-machine
competition against another elite player. But in this first experiment, we both failed to combine
human and machine skills effectively. Advanced Chess found
its home on the internet, and in 2005, a so-called
freestyle chess tournament produced a revelation. A team of grandmasters
and top machines participated, but the winners were not grandmasters, not a supercomputer. The winners were a pair
of amateur American chess players operating three ordinary PCs
at the same time. Their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted
the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater
computational power of others. And I reached this formulation. A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone, but more remarkably,
is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process. This convinced me that we would need better interfaces
to help us coach our machines towards more useful intelligence. 10:58Human plus machine isn't the future, it's the present. Everybody that's used online translation to get the gist of a news article
from a foreign newspaper, knowing its far from perfect. Then we use our human experience to make sense out of that, and then the machine
learns from our corrections. This model is spreading and investing
in medical diagnosis, security analysis. The machine crunches data, calculates probabilities, gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent, making it easier for analysis and decision-making of the human party. But you are not going to send your kids to school in a self-driving car
with 90 percent accuracy, even with 99 percent. So we need a leap forward to add a few more crucial decimal places. 12:07Twenty years after
my match with Deep Blue, second match, this sensational
""The Brain's Last Stand"" headline has become commonplace as intelligent machines move in every sector, seemingly every day. But unlike in the past, when machines replaced farm animals, manual labor, now they are coming
after people with college degrees and political influence. And as someone
who fought machines and lost, I am here to tell you
this is excellent, excellent news. Eventually, every profession will have to feel these pressures or else it will mean humanity
has ceased to make progress. We don't get to choose when and where
technological progress stops. We cannot slow down. In fact, we have to speed up. Our technology excels at removing difficulties and uncertainties
from our lives, and so we must seek out ever more difficult, ever more uncertain challenges. Machines have calculations. We have understanding. Machines have instructions. We have purpose. Machines have objectivity. We have passion. We should not worry
about what our machines can do today. Instead, we should worry
about what they still cannot do today, because we will need the help
of the new, intelligent machines to turn our grandest dreams into reality. And if we fail, if we fail, it's not because our machines
are too intelligent, or not intelligent enough. If we fail, it's because
we grew complacent and limited our ambitions. Our humanity is not defined by any skill, like swinging a hammer
or even playing chess. 14:54There's one thing only a human can do. That's dream. So let us dream big. 15:02Thank you. 15:03(Applause)"

Now, tell me which Obama here is real. 00:04(Video) Barack Obama: To help families
refinance their homes, to invest in things
like high-tech manufacturing, clean energy and the infrastructure
that creates good new jobs. 00:14Supasorn Suwajanakorn: Anyone? The answer is none of them. 00:18(Laughter) 00:19None of these is actually real. So let me tell you how we got here. My inspiration for this work was a project meant to preserve our last
chance for learning about the Holocaust from the survivors. It's called New Dimensions in Testimony, and it allows you to have
interactive conversations with a hologram
of a real Holocaust survivor. 00:41(Video) Man: How did you
survive the Holocaust? 00:43(Video) Hologram: How did I survive? I survived, I believe, because providence watched over me. 00:53SS: Turns out these answers
were prerecorded in a studio. Yet the effect is astounding. You feel so connected to his story
and to him as a person. I think there's something special
about human interaction that makes it much more profound and personal than what books or lectures
or movies could ever teach us. 01:16So I saw this and began to wonder, can we create a model
like this for anyone? A model that looks, talks
and acts just like them? So I set out to see if this could be done and eventually came up with a new solution that can build a model of a person
using nothing but these: existing photos and videos of a person. If you can leverage
this kind of passive information, just photos and video that are out there, that's the key to scaling to anyone. 01:44By the way, here's Richard Feynman, who in addition to being
a Nobel Prize winner in physics was also known as a legendary teacher. Wouldn't it be great
if we could bring him back to give his lectures
and inspire millions of kids, perhaps not just in English
but in any language? Or if you could ask our grandparents
for advice and hear those comforting words even if they're no longer with us? Or maybe using this tool,
book authors, alive or not, could read aloud all of their books
for anyone interested. 02:17The creative possibilities
here are endless, and to me, that's very exciting. And here's how it's working so far. 02:24First, we introduce a new technique that can reconstruct a high-detailed
3D face model from any image without ever 3D-scanning the person. And here's the same output model
from different views. This also works on videos, by running the same algorithm
on each video frame and generating a moving 3D model. And here's the same
output model from different angles. 02:49It turns out this problem
is very challenging, but the key trick
is that we are going to analyze a large photo collection
of the person beforehand. For George W. Bush,
we can just search on Google, and from that, we are able
to build an average model, an iterative, refined model
to recover the expression in fine details,
like creases and wrinkles. What's fascinating about this is that the photo collection
can come from your typical photos. It doesn't really matter
what expression you're making or where you took those photos. What matters is
that there are a lot of them. And we are still missing color here, so next, we develop
a new blending technique that improves upon
a single averaging method and produces sharp
facial textures and colors. And this can be done for any expression. 03:37Now we have a control
of a model of a person, and the way it's controlled now
is by a sequence of static photos. Notice how the wrinkles come and go,
depending on the expression. We can also use a video
to drive the model. 03:50(Video) Daniel Craig: Right, but somehow, we've managed to attract
some more amazing people. 03:58SS: And here's another fun demo. So what you see here
are controllable models of people I built
from their internet photos. Now, if you transfer
the motion from the input video, we can actually drive the entire party. 04:09George W. Bush:
It's a difficult bill to pass, because there's a lot of moving parts, and the legislative processes can be ugly. 04:19(Applause) 04:20SS: So coming back a little bit, our ultimate goal, rather,
is to capture their mannerisms or the unique way each
of these people talks and smiles. So to do that, can we
actually teach the computer to imitate the way someone talks by only showing it
video footage of the person? And what I did exactly was,
I let a computer watch 14 hours of pure Barack Obama
giving addresses. And here's what we can produce
given only his audio. 04:46(Video) BO: The results are clear. America's businesses have created
14.5 million new jobs over 75 straight months. 04:55SS: So what's being synthesized here
is only the mouth region, and here's how we do it. Our pipeline uses a neural network to convert and input audio
into these mouth points. 05:06(Video) BO: We get it through our job
or through Medicare or Medicaid. 05:10SS: Then we synthesize the texture,
enhance details and teeth, and blend it into the head
and background from a source video. 05:17(Video) BO: Women can get free checkups, and you can't get charged more
just for being a woman. Young people can stay
on a parent's plan until they turn 26. 05:27SS: I think these results
seem very realistic and intriguing, but at the same time
frightening, even to me. Our goal was to build an accurate model
of a person, not to misrepresent them. But one thing that concerns me
is its potential for misuse. People have been thinking
about this problem for a long time, since the days when Photoshop
first hit the market. As a researcher, I'm also working
on countermeasure technology, and I'm part of an ongoing
effort at AI Foundation, which uses a combination
of machine learning and human moderators to detect fake images and videos, fighting against my own work. And one of the tools we plan to release
is called Reality Defender, which is a web-browser plug-in
that can flag potentially fake content automatically, right in the browser. 06:12(Applause) 06:16Despite all this, though, fake videos could do a lot of damage, even before anyone has a chance to verify, so it's very important
that we make everyone aware of what's currently possible so we can have the right assumption
and be critical about what we see. 06:32There's still a long way to go before
we can fully model individual people and before we can ensure
the safety of this technology. But I'm excited and hopeful, because if we use it right and carefully, this tool can allow any individual's

3,How deepfakes undermine truth and threaten democracy,Danielle Citron,Sep 2019,"The use of deepfake technology to manipulate video and audio for malicious purposes -- whether it's to stoke violence or defame politicians and journalists -- is becoming a real threat. As these tools become more accessible and their products more realistic, how will they shape what we believe about the world? In a portentous talk, law professor Danielle Citron reveals how deepfakes magnify our distrust -- and suggests approaches to safeguarding the truth.", (104K),"Transcript (18 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00[This talk contains mature content] 00:05footnotefootnoteRana Ayyub is a journalist in India whose work has exposed
government corruption and human rights violations. And over the years, she's gotten used to vitriol
and controversy around her work. But none of it could have prepared her
for what she faced in April 2018. 00:26footnotefootnoteShe was sitting in a café with a friend
when she first saw it: a two-minute, 20-second video
of her engaged in a sex act. And she couldn't believe her eyes. She had never made a sex video. But unfortunately, thousands
upon thousands of people would believe it was her. 00:46footnotefootnoteI interviewed Ms. Ayyub
about three months ago, in connection with my book
on sexual privacy. I'm a law professor, lawyer
and civil rights advocate. So it's incredibly frustrating
knowing that right now, law could do very little to help her. And as we talked, she explained that she should have seen
the fake sex video coming. She said, ""After all, sex is so often used
to demean and to shame women, especially minority women, and especially minority women
who dare to challenge powerful men,"" as she had in her work. The fake sex video went viral in 48 hours. All of her online accounts were flooded
with screenshots of the video, with graphic rape and death threats and with slurs about her Muslim faith. Online posts suggested that
she was ""available"" for sex. And she was doxed, which means that her home address
and her cell phone number were spread across the internet. The video was shared
more than 40,000 times. 01:57Now, when someone is targeted
with this kind of cybermob attack, the harm is profound. Rana Ayyub's life was turned upside down. For weeks, she could hardly eat or speak. She stopped writing and closed
all of her social media accounts, which is, you know, a tough thing to do
when you're a journalist. And she was afraid to go outside
her family's home. What if the posters
made good on their threats? The UN Council on Human Rights
confirmed that she wasn't being crazy. It issued a public statement saying
that they were worried about her safety. 02:36footnotefootnoteWhat Rana Ayyub faced was a deepfake: machine-learning technology that manipulates or fabricates
audio and video recordings to show people doing and saying things that they never did or said. Deepfakes appear authentic
and realistic, but they're not; they're total falsehoods. Although the technology
is still developing in its sophistication, it is widely available. 03:05footnotefootnoteNow, the most recent attention
to deepfakes arose, as so many things do online, with pornography. 03:12footnotefootnoteIn early 2018, someone posted a tool on Reddit to allow users to insert faces
into porn videos. And what followed was a cascade
of fake porn videos featuring people's favorite
female celebrities. And today, you can go on YouTube
and pull up countless tutorials with step-by-step instructions on how to make a deepfake
on your desktop application. And soon we may be even able
to make them on our cell phones. Now, it's the interaction
of some of our most basic human frailties and network tools that can turn deepfakes into weapons. So let me explain. 03:54footnotefootnoteAs human beings, we have
a visceral reaction to audio and video. We believe they're true, on the notion that
of course you can believe what your eyes and ears are telling you. And it's that mechanism that might undermine our shared
sense of reality. Although we believe deepfakes
to be true, they're not. And we're attracted
to the salacious, the provocative. We tend to believe
and to share information that's negative and novel. And researchers have found that online
hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories. Now, we're also drawn to information that aligns with our viewpoints. Psychologists call that tendency
""confirmation bias."" And social media platforms
supercharge that tendency, by allowing us to instantly
and widely share information that accords with our viewpoints. 04:56footnotefootnoteNow, deepfakes have the potential to cause
grave individual and societal harm. So, imagine a deepfake that shows American soldiers
in Afganistan burning a Koran. You can imagine that that deepfake
would provoke violence against those soldiers. And what if the very next day there's another deepfake that drops, that shows a well-known imam
based in London praising the attack on those soldiers? We might see violence and civil unrest, not only in Afganistan
and the United Kingdom, but across the globe. 05:36And you might say to me, ""Come on, Danielle, that's far-fetched."" But it's not. We've seen falsehoods spread on WhatsApp and other
online message services lead to violence
against ethnic minorities. And that was just text -- imagine if it were video. 05:54footnotefootnoteNow, deepfakes have the potential
to corrode the trust that we have in democratic institutions. So, imagine the night before an election. There's a deepfake showing
one of the major party candidates gravely sick. The deepfake could tip the election and shake our sense
that elections are legitimate. Imagine if the night before
an initial public offering of a major global bank, there was a deepfake
showing the bank's CEO drunkenly spouting conspiracy theories. The deepfake could tank the IPO, and worse, shake our sense
that financial markets are stable. 06:39So deepfakes can exploit and magnify
the deep distrust that we already have in politicians, business leaders
and other influential leaders. They find an audience
primed to believe them. And the pursuit of truth
is on the line as well. Technologists expect
that with advances in AI, soon it may be difficult if not impossible to tell the difference between
a real video and a fake one. 07:11footnotefootnoteSo how can the truth emerge
in a deepfake-ridden marketplace of ideas? Will we just proceed along
the path of least resistance and believe what we want to believe, truth be damned? And not only might we believe the fakery, we might start disbelieving the truth. We've already seen people invoke
the phenomenon of deepfakes to cast doubt on real evidence
of their wrongdoing. We've heard politicians say of audio
of their disturbing comments, ""Come on, that's fake news. You can't believe what your eyes
and ears are telling you."" And it's that risk that professor Robert Chesney and I
call the ""liar's dividend"": the risk that liars will invoke deepfakes to escape accountability
for their wrongdoing. 08:06footnotefootnoteSo we've got our work cut out for us,
there's no doubt about it. And we're going to need
a proactive solution from tech companies, from lawmakers, law enforcers and the media. And we're going to need
a healthy dose of societal resilience. So now, we're right now engaged
in a very public conversation about the responsibility
of tech companies. And my advice to social media platforms has been to change their terms of service
and community guidelines to ban deepfakes that cause harm. That determination,
that's going to require human judgment, and it's expensive. But we need human beings to look at the content
and context of a deepfake to figure out if it is
a harmful impersonation or instead, if it's valuable
satire, art or education. 09:04footnotefootnoteSo now, what about the law? Law is our educator. It teaches us about
what's harmful and what's wrong. And it shapes behavior it deters
by punishing perpetrators and securing remedies for victims. Right now, law is not up to
the challenge of deepfakes. Across the globe, we lack well-tailored laws that would be designed to tackle
digital impersonations that invade sexual privacy, that damage reputations and that cause emotional distress. What happened to Rana Ayyub
is increasingly commonplace. Yet, when she went
to law enforcement in Delhi, she was told nothing could be done. And the sad truth is
that the same would be true in the United States and in Europe. 09:55footnotefootnoteSo we have a legal vacuum
that needs to be filled. My colleague Dr. Mary Anne Franks and I
are working with US lawmakers to devise legislation that would ban
harmful digital impersonations that are tantamount to identity theft. And we've seen similar moves in Iceland, the UK and Australia. But of course, that's just a small piece
of the regulatory puzzle. 10:22Now, I know law is not a cure-all. Right? It's a blunt instrument. And we've got to use it wisely. It also has some practical impediments. You can't leverage law against people
you can't identify and find. And if a perpetrator lives
outside the country where a victim lives, then you may not be able to insist that the perpetrator
come into local courts to face justice. And so we're going to need
a coordinated international response. Education has to be part
of our response as well. Law enforcers are not
going to enforce laws they don't know about and proffer problems
they don't understand. In my research on cyberstalking, I found that law enforcement
lacked the training to understand the laws available to them and the problem of online abuse. And so often they told victims, ""Just turn your computer off.
Ignore it. It'll go away."" And we saw that in Rana Ayyub's case. She was told, ""Come on,
you're making such a big deal about this. It's boys being boys."" And so we need to pair new legislation
with efforts at training. 11:42And education has to be aimed
on the media as well. Journalists need educating
about the phenomenon of deepfakes so they don't amplify and spread them. And this is the part
where we're all involved. Each and every one of us needs educating. We click, we share, we like,
and we don't even think about it. We need to do better. We need far better radar for fakery. 12:13So as we're working
through these solutions, there's going to be
a lot of suffering to go around. Rana Ayyub is still wrestling
with the fallout. She still doesn't feel free
to express herself on- and offline. And as she told me, she still feels like there are thousands
of eyes on her naked body, even though, intellectually,
she knows it wasn't her body. And she has frequent panic attacks, especially when someone she doesn't know
tries to take her picture. ""What if they're going to make
another deepfake?"" she thinks to herself. And so for the sake of
individuals like Rana Ayyub and the sake of our democracy, we need to do something right now. 12:59Thank you. 13:00(Applause)"
3,How I'm fighting bias in algorithms,Joy Buolamwini,Mar 2017,"MIT grad student Joy Buolamwini was working with facial analysis software when she noticed a problem: the software didn't detect her face -- because the people who coded the algorithm hadn't taught it to identify a broad range of skin tones and facial structures. Now she's on a mission to fight bias in machine learning, a phenomenon she calls the ""coded gaze."" It's an eye-opening talk about the need for accountability in coding ... as algorithms take over more and more aspects of ...", (47K),"Transcript (22 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code, on a mission to stop
an unseen force that's rising, a force that I called ""the coded gaze,"" my term for algorithmic bias. 00:15Algorithmic bias, like human bias,
results in unfairness. However, algorithms, like viruses,
can spread bias on a massive scale at a rapid pace. Algorithmic bias can also lead
to exclusionary experiences and discriminatory practices. Let me show you what I mean. 00:36(Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera.
I've got a face. Can you see my face? No-glasses face? You can see her face. What about my face? I've got a mask. Can you see my mask? 00:56Joy Buolamwini: So how did this happen? Why am I sitting in front of a computer in a white mask, trying to be detected by a cheap webcam? Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze as a poet of code, I'm a graduate student
at the MIT Media Lab, and there I have the opportunity to work
on all sorts of whimsical projects, including the Aspire Mirror, a project I did so I could project
digital masks onto my reflection. So in the morning, if I wanted
to feel powerful, I could put on a lion. If I wanted to be uplifted,
I might have a quote. So I used generic
facial recognition software to build the system, but found it was really hard to test it
unless I wore a white mask. 01:44Unfortunately, I've run
into this issue before. When I was an undergraduate
at Georgia Tech studying computer science, I used to work on social robots, and one of my tasks was to get a robot
to play peek-a-boo, a simple turn-taking game where partners cover their face
and then uncover it saying, ""Peek-a-boo!"" The problem is, peek-a-boo
doesn't really work if I can't see you, and my robot couldn't see me. But I borrowed my roommate's face
to get the project done, submitted the assignment, and figured, you know what,
somebody else will solve this problem. 02:21Not too long after, I was in Hong Kong
for an entrepreneurship competition. The organizers decided
to take participants on a tour of local start-ups. One of the start-ups had a social robot, and they decided to do a demo. The demo worked on everybody
until it got to me, and you can probably guess it. It couldn't detect my face. I asked the developers what was going on, and it turned out we had used the same
generic facial recognition software. Halfway around the world, I learned that algorithmic bias
can travel as quickly as it takes to download
some files off of the internet. 03:03footnotefootnoteSo what's going on?
Why isn't my face being detected? Well, we have to look
at how we give machines sight. Computer vision uses
machine learning techniques to do facial recognition. So how this works is, you create
a training set with examples of faces. This is a face. This is a face.
This is not a face. And over time, you can teach a computer
how to recognize other faces. However, if the training sets
aren't really that diverse, any face that deviates too much
from the established norm will be harder to detect, which is what was happening to me. 03:37But don't worry -- there's some good news. Training sets don't just
materialize out of nowhere. We actually can create them. So there's an opportunity to create
full-spectrum training sets that reflect a richer
portrait of humanity. 03:52Now you've seen in my examples how social robots was how I found out about exclusion
with algorithmic bias. But algorithmic bias can also lead
to discriminatory practices. Across the US, police departments are starting to use
facial recognition software in their crime-fighting arsenal. Georgetown Law published a report showing that one in two adults
in the US -- that's 117 million people -- have their faces
in facial recognition networks. Police departments can currently look
at these networks unregulated, using algorithms that have not
been audited for accuracy. Yet we know facial recognition
is not fail proof, and labeling faces consistently
remains a challenge. You might have seen this on Facebook. My friends and I laugh all the time
when we see other people mislabeled in our photos. But misidentifying a suspected criminal
is no laughing matter, nor is breaching civil liberties. 05:00Machine learning is being used
for facial recognition, but it's also extending beyond the realm
of computer vision. In her book, ""Weapons
of Math Destruction,"" data scientist Cathy O'Neil
talks about the rising new WMDs -- widespread, mysterious
and destructive algorithms that are increasingly being used
to make decisions that impact more aspects of our lives. So who gets hired or fired? Do you get that loan?
Do you get insurance? Are you admitted into the college
you wanted to get into? Do you and I pay the same price
for the same product purchased on the same platform? 05:44Law enforcement is also starting
to use machine learning for predictive policing. Some judges use machine-generated
risk scores to determine how long an individual
is going to spend in prison. So we really have to think
about these decisions. Are they fair? And we've seen that algorithmic bias doesn't necessarily always
lead to fair outcomes. 06:08So what can we do about it? Well, we can start thinking about
how we create more inclusive code and employ inclusive coding practices. It really starts with people. So who codes matters. Are we creating full-spectrum teams
with diverse individuals who can check each other's blind spots? On the technical side,
how we code matters. Are we factoring in fairness
as we're developing systems? And finally, why we code matters. We've used tools of computational creation
to unlock immense wealth. We now have the opportunity
to unlock even greater equality if we make social change a priority and not an afterthought. And so these are the three tenets
that will make up the ""incoding"" movement. Who codes matters, how we code matters and why we code matters. 07:03So to go towards incoding,
we can start thinking about building platforms that can identify bias by collecting people's experiences
like the ones I shared, but also auditing existing software. We can also start to create
more inclusive training sets. Imagine a ""Selfies for Inclusion"" campaign where you and I can help
developers test and create more inclusive training sets. And we can also start thinking
more conscientiously about the social impact
of the technology that we're developing. 07:37To get the incoding movement started, I've launched the Algorithmic
Justice League, where anyone who cares about fairness
can help fight the coded gaze. On codedgaze.com, you can report bias, request audits, become a tester and join the ongoing conversation, #codedgaze. 08:00So I invite you to join me in creating a world where technology
works for all of us, not just some of us, a world where we value inclusion
and center social change. 08:13Thank you. 08:14(Applause) 08:20But I have one question: Will you join me in the fight? 08:25(Laughter) 08:27(Applause)"
3,What AI is — and isn't,Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson,Nov 2017,"Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity. In an inspiring, informative conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Thrun discusses the progress of deep learning, why we shouldn't fear runaway AI and how society will be better off if dull, tedious work is done with the help of machines. ""Only one percent of interesting things have been invented yet,"" Thrun says. ""I believe all of us are insanely cr...", (50K),"Transcript (14 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroTürkçeРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Chris Anderson: Help us understand
what machine learning is, because that seems to be the key driver of so much of the excitement
and also of the concern around artificial intelligence. How does machine learning work? 00:11Sebastian Thrun: So, artificial
intelligence and machine learning is about 60 years old and has not had a great day
in its past until recently. And the reason is that today, we have reached a scale
of computing and datasets that was necessary to make machines smart. So here's how it works. If you program a computer today,
say, your phone, then you hire software engineers that write a very,
very long kitchen recipe, like, ""If the water is too hot,
turn down the temperature. If it's too cold, turn up
the temperature."" The recipes are not just 10 lines long. They are millions of lines long. A modern cell phone
has 12 million lines of code. A browser has five million lines of code. And each bug in this recipe
can cause your computer to crash. That's why a software engineer
makes so much money. The new thing now is that computers
can find their own rules. So instead of an expert
deciphering, step by step, a rule for every contingency, what you do now is you give
the computer examples and have it infer its own rules. 01:24A really good example is AlphaGo,
which recently was won by Google. Normally, in game playing,
you would really write down all the rules, but in AlphaGo's case, the system looked over a million games and was able to infer its own rules and then beat the world's
residing Go champion. That is exciting, because it relieves
the software engineer of the need of being super smart, and pushes the burden towards the data. As I said, the inflection point
where this has become really possible -- very embarrassing, my thesis
was about machine learning. It was completely
insignificant, don't read it, because it was 20 years ago and back then, the computers
were as big as a cockroach brain. Now they are powerful enough
to really emulate kind of specialized human thinking. And then the computers
take advantage of the fact that they can look at
much more data than people can. So I'd say AlphaGo looked at
more than a million games. No human expert can ever
study a million games. Google has looked at over
a hundred billion web pages. No person can ever study
a hundred billion web pages. So as a result,
the computer can find rules that even people can't find. 02:29CA: So instead of looking ahead
to, ""If he does that, I will do that,"" it's more saying, ""Here is what
looks like a winning pattern, here is what looks like
a winning pattern."" 02:38ST: Yeah. I mean, think about
how you raise children. You don't spend the first 18 years
giving kids a rule for every contingency and set them free
and they have this big program. They stumble, fall, get up,
they get slapped or spanked, and they have a positive experience,
a good grade in school, and they figure it out on their own. That's happening with computers now, which makes computer programming
so much easier all of a sudden. Now we don't have to think anymore.
We just give them lots of data. 03:02CA: And so, this has been key
to the spectacular improvement in power of self-driving cars. I think you gave me an example. Can you explain what's happening here? 03:13ST: This is a drive of a self-driving car that we happened to have at Udacity and recently made
into a spin-off called Voyage. We have used this thing
called deep learning to train a car to drive itself, and this is driving
from Mountain View, California, to San Francisco on El Camino Real on a rainy day, with bicyclists and pedestrians
and 133 traffic lights. And the novel thing here is, many, many moons ago, I started
the Google self-driving car team. And back in the day, I hired
the world's best software engineers to find the world's best rules. This is just trained. We drive this road 20 times, we put all this data
into the computer brain, and after a few hours of processing, it comes up with behavior
that often surpasses human agility. So it's become really easy to program it. This is 100 percent autonomous,
about 33 miles, an hour and a half. 04:05CA: So, explain it -- on the big part
of this program on the left, you're seeing basically what
the computer sees as trucks and cars and those dots overtaking it and so forth. 04:15ST: On the right side, you see the camera
image, which is the main input here, and it's used to find lanes,
other cars, traffic lights. The vehicle has a radar
to do distance estimation. This is very commonly used
in these kind of systems. On the left side you see a laser diagram, where you see obstacles like trees
and so on depicted by the laser. But almost all the interesting work
is centering on the camera image now. We're really shifting over from precision
sensors like radars and lasers into very cheap, commoditized sensors. A camera costs less than eight dollars. 04:43CA: And that green dot
on the left thing, what is that? Is that anything meaningful? 04:47ST: This is a look-ahead point
for your adaptive cruise control, so it helps us understand
how to regulate velocity based on how far
the cars in front of you are. 04:56CA: And so, you've also
got an example, I think, of how the actual
learning part takes place. Maybe we can see that. Talk about this. 05:03ST: This is an example where we posed
a challenge to Udacity students to take what we call
a self-driving car Nanodegree. We gave them this dataset and said ""Hey, can you guys figure out
how to steer this car?"" And if you look at the images, it's, even for humans, quite impossible
to get the steering right. And we ran a competition and said,
""It's a deep learning competition, AI competition,"" and we gave the students 48 hours. So if you are a software house
like Google or Facebook, something like this costs you
at least six months of work. So we figured 48 hours is great. And within 48 hours, we got about
100 submissions from students, and the top four got it perfectly right. It drives better than I could
drive on this imagery, using deep learning. And again, it's the same methodology. It's this magical thing. When you give enough data
to a computer now, and give enough time
to comprehend the data, it finds its own rules. 05:57CA: And so that has led to the development
of powerful applications in all sorts of areas. You were talking to me
the other day about cancer. Can I show this video? 06:07ST: Yeah, absolutely, please.
CA: This is cool. 06:10ST: This is kind of an insight
into what's happening in a completely different domain. This is augmenting, or competing -- it's in the eye of the beholder -- with people who are being paid
400,000 dollars a year, dermatologists, highly trained specialists. It takes more than a decade of training
to be a good dermatologist. What you see here is
the machine learning version of it. It's called a neural network. ""Neural networks"" is the technical term
for these machine learning algorithms. They've been around since the 1980s. This one was invented in 1988
by a Facebook Fellow called Yann LeCun, and it propagates data stages through what you could think of
as the human brain. It's not quite the same thing,
but it emulates the same thing. It goes stage after stage. In the very first stage, it takes
the visual input and extracts edges and rods and dots. And the next one becomes
more complicated edges and shapes like little half-moons. And eventually, it's able to build
really complicated concepts. Andrew Ng has been able to show that it's able to find
cat faces and dog faces in vast amounts of images. 07:22What my student team
at Stanford has shown is that if you train it on 129,000 images
of skin conditions, including melanoma and carcinomas, you can do as good a job as the best human dermatologists. And to convince ourselves
that this is the case, we captured an independent dataset
that we presented to our network and to 25 board-certified
Stanford-level dermatologists, and compared those. And in most cases, they were either on par or above
the performance classification accuracy of human dermatologists. 07:58CA: You were telling me an anecdote. I think about this image right here. What happened here? 08:03ST: This was last Thursday.
That's a moving piece. What we've shown before and we published
in ""Nature"" earlier this year was this idea that we show
dermatologists images and our computer program images, and count how often they're right. But all these images are past images. They've all been biopsied to make sure
we had the correct classification. This one wasn't. This one was actually done at Stanford
by one of our collaborators. The story goes that our collaborator, who is a world-famous dermatologist,
one of the three best, apparently, looked at this mole and said,
""This is not skin cancer."" And then he had
a second moment, where he said, ""Well, let me just check with the app."" So he took out his iPhone
and ran our piece of software, our ""pocket dermatologist,"" so to speak, and the iPhone said: cancer. It said melanoma. And then he was confused. And he decided, ""OK, maybe I trust
the iPhone a little bit more than myself,"" and he sent it out to the lab
to get it biopsied. And it came up as an aggressive melanoma. So I think this might be the first time
that we actually found, in the practice of using deep learning, an actual person whose melanoma
would have gone unclassified, had it not been for deep learning. 09:12CA: I mean, that's incredible. 09:14(Applause) 09:16It feels like there'd be an instant demand
for an app like this right now, that you might freak out a lot of people. Are you thinking of doing this,
making an app that allows self-checking? 09:25ST: So my in-box is flooded
about cancer apps, with heartbreaking stories of people. I mean, some people have had
10, 15, 20 melanomas removed, and are scared that one
might be overlooked, like this one, and also, about, I don't know, flying cars and speaker inquiries 
these days, I guess. My take is, we need more testing. I want to be very careful. It's very easy to give a flashy result
and impress a TED audience. It's much harder to put
something out that's ethical. And if people were to use the app and choose not to consult
the assistance of a doctor because we get it wrong, I would feel really bad about it. So we're currently doing clinical tests, and if these clinical tests commence
and our data holds up, we might be able at some point
to take this kind of technology and take it out of the Stanford clinic and bring it to the entire world, places where Stanford
doctors never, ever set foot. 10:18CA: And do I hear this right, that it seemed like what you were saying, because you are working
with this army of Udacity students, that in a way, you're applying
a different form of machine learning than might take place in a company, which is you're combining machine learning
with a form of crowd wisdom. Are you saying that sometimes you think
that could actually outperform what a company can do,
even a vast company? 10:41ST: I believe there's now
instances that blow my mind, and I'm still trying to understand. What Chris is referring to
is these competitions that we run. We turn them around in 48 hours, and we've been able to build
a self-driving car that can drive from Mountain View
to San Francisco on surface streets. It's not quite on par with Google
after seven years of Google work, but it's getting there. And it took us only two engineers
and three months to do this. And the reason is, we have
an army of students who participate in competitions. We're not the only ones
who use crowdsourcing. Uber and Didi use crowdsource for driving. Airbnb uses crowdsourcing for hotels. There's now many examples
where people do bug-finding crowdsourcing or protein folding, of all things,
in crowdsourcing. But we've been able to build
this car in three months, so I am actually rethinking how we organize corporations. 11:35We have a staff of 9,000 people
who are never hired, that I never fire. They show up to work
and I don't even know. Then they submit to me
maybe 9,000 answers. I'm not obliged to use any of those. I end up -- I pay only the winners, so I'm actually very cheapskate here,
which is maybe not the best thing to do. But they consider it part
of their education, too, which is nice. But these students have been able
to produce amazing deep learning results. So yeah, the synthesis of great people
and great machine learning is amazing. 12:06CA: I mean, Gary Kasparov said on
the first day [of TED2017] that the winners of chess, surprisingly,
turned out to be two amateur chess players with three mediocre-ish,
mediocre-to-good, computer programs, that could outperform one grand master
with one great chess player, like it was all part of the process. And it almost seems like
you're talking about a much richer version of that same idea. 12:29ST: Yeah, I mean, as you followed
the fantastic panels yesterday morning, two sessions about AI, robotic overlords and the human response, many, many great things were said. But one of the concerns is
that we sometimes confuse what's actually been done with AI
with this kind of overlord threat, where your AI develops
consciousness, right? The last thing I want
is for my AI to have consciousness. I don't want to come into my kitchen and have the refrigerator fall in love
with the dishwasher and tell me, because I wasn't nice enough, my food is now warm. I wouldn't buy these products,
and I don't want them. But the truth is, for me, AI has always been
an augmentation of people. It's been an augmentation of us, to make us stronger. And I think Kasparov was exactly correct. It's been the combination
of human smarts and machine smarts that make us stronger. The theme of machines making us stronger
is as old as machines are. The agricultural revolution took
place because it made steam engines and farming equipment
that couldn't farm by itself, that never replaced us;
it made us stronger. And I believe this new wave of AI
will make us much, much stronger as a human race. 13:41CA: We'll come on to that a bit more, but just to continue with the scary part
of this for some people, like, what feels like it gets
scary for people is when you have a computer that can, one,
rewrite its own code, so, it can create
multiple copies of itself, try a bunch of different code versions, possibly even at random, and then check them out and see
if a goal is achieved and improved. So, say the goal is to do better
on an intelligence test. You know, a computer
that's moderately good at that, you could try a million versions of that. You might find one that was better, and then, you know, repeat. And so the concern is that you get
some sort of runaway effect where everything is fine
on Thursday evening, and you come back into the lab
on Friday morning, and because of the speed
of computers and so forth, things have gone crazy, and suddenly -- 14:33ST: I would say this is a possibility, but it's a very remote possibility. So let me just translate
what I heard you say. In the AlphaGo case,
we had exactly this thing: the computer would play
the game against itself and then learn new rules. And what machine learning is
is a rewriting of the rules. It's the rewriting of code. But I think there was
absolutely no concern that AlphaGo would take over the world. It can't even play chess. 14:59CA: No, no, no, but now,
these are all very single-domain things. But it's possible to imagine. I mean, we just saw a computer
that seemed nearly capable of passing a university entrance test, that can kind of -- it can't read
and understand in the sense that we can, but it can certainly absorb all the text and maybe see increased
patterns of meaning. Isn't there a chance that,
as this broadens out, there could be a different
kind of runaway effect? 15:27ST: That's where
I draw the line, honestly. And the chance exists --
I don't want to downplay it -- but I think it's remote, and it's not
the thing that's on my mind these days, because I think the big revolution
is something else. Everything successful in AI
to the present date has been extremely specialized, and it's been thriving on a single idea, which is massive amounts of data. The reason AlphaGo works so well
is because of massive numbers of Go plays, and AlphaGo can't drive a car
or fly a plane. The Google self-driving car
or the Udacity self-driving car thrives on massive amounts of data,
and it can't do anything else. It can't even control a motorcycle. It's a very specific,
domain-specific function, and the same is true for our cancer app. There has been almost no progress
on this thing called ""general AI,"" where you go to an AI and say,
""Hey, invent for me special relativity or string theory."" It's totally in the infancy. 16:20The reason I want to emphasize this, I see the concerns,
and I want to acknowledge them. But if I were to think about one thing, I would ask myself the question,
""What if we can take anything repetitive and make ourselves
100 times as efficient?"" It so turns out, 300 years ago,
we all worked in agriculture and did farming and did repetitive things. Today, 75 percent of us work in offices and do repetitive things. We've become spreadsheet monkeys. And not just low-end labor. We've become dermatologists
doing repetitive things, lawyers doing repetitive things. I think we are at the brink
of being able to take an AI, look over our shoulders, and they make us maybe 10 or 50 times
as effective in these repetitive things. That's what is on my mind. 17:10CA: That sounds super exciting. The process of getting there seems
a little terrifying to some people, because once a computer
can do this repetitive thing much better than the dermatologist or than the driver, especially,
is the thing that's talked about so much now, suddenly millions of jobs go, and, you know, the country's in revolution before we ever get to the more
glorious aspects of what's possible. 17:36ST: Yeah, and that's an issue,
and it's a big issue, and it was pointed out yesterday morning
by several guest speakers. Now, prior to me showing up onstage, I confessed I'm a positive,
optimistic person, so let me give you an optimistic pitch, which is, think of yourself
back 300 years ago. Europe just survived 140 years
of continuous war, none of you could read or write, there were no jobs that you hold today, like investment banker
or software engineer or TV anchor. We would all be in the fields and farming. Now here comes little Sebastian
with a little steam engine in his pocket, saying, ""Hey guys, look at this. It's going to make you 100 times
as strong, so you can do something else."" And then back in the day,
there was no real stage, but Chris and I hang out
with the cows in the stable, and he says, ""I'm really
concerned about it, because I milk my cow every day,
and what if the machine does this for me?"" 18:31The reason why I mention this is, we're always good in acknowledging
past progress and the benefit of it, like our iPhones or our planes
or electricity or medical supply. We all love to live to 80,
which was impossible 300 years ago. But we kind of don't apply
the same rules to the future. So if I look at my own job as a CEO, I would say 90 percent
of my work is repetitive, I don't enjoy it, I spend about four hours per day
on stupid, repetitive email. And I'm burning to have something
that helps me get rid of this. Why? Because I believe all of us
are insanely creative; I think the TED community
more than anybody else. But even blue-collar workers;
I think you can go to your hotel maid and have a drink with him or her, and an hour later,
you find a creative idea. What this will empower
is to turn this creativity into action. Like, what if you could
build Google in a day? What if you could sit over beer
and invent the next Snapchat, whatever it is, and tomorrow morning it's up and running? 19:37And that is not science fiction. What's going to happen is, we are already in history. We've unleashed this amazing creativity by de-slaving us from farming and later, of course, from factory work and have invented so many things. It's going to be even better,
in my opinion. And there's going to be
great side effects. One of the side effects will be that things like food and medical supply
and education and shelter and transportation will all become much more
affordable to all of us, not just the rich people. 20:10CA: Hmm. So when Martin Ford argued, you know,
that this time it's different because the intelligence
that we've used in the past to find new ways to be will be matched at the same pace by computers taking over those things, what I hear you saying
is that, not completely, because of human creativity. Do you think that that's fundamentally
different from the kind of creativity that computers can do? 20:38ST: So, that's my firm
belief as an AI person -- that I haven't seen
any real progress on creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. What I see right now -- and this is
really important for people to realize, because the word ""artificial
intelligence"" is so threatening, and then we have Steve Spielberg
tossing a movie in, where all of a sudden
the computer is our overlord, but it's really a technology. It's a technology that helps us
do repetitive things. And the progress has been
entirely on the repetitive end. It's been in legal document discovery. It's been contract drafting. It's been screening X-rays of your chest. And these things are so specialized, I don't see the big threat of humanity. In fact, we as people -- I mean, let's face it:
we've become superhuman. We've made us superhuman. We can swim across
the Atlantic in 11 hours. We can take a device out of our pocket and shout all the way to Australia, and in real time, have that person
shouting back to us. That's physically not possible.
We're breaking the rules of physics. When this is said and done,
we're going to remember everything we've ever said and seen, you'll remember every person, which is good for me
in my early stages of Alzheimer's. Sorry, what was I saying? I forgot. 21:50CA: (Laughs) 21:51ST: We will probably have
an IQ of 1,000 or more. There will be no more
spelling classes for our kids, because there's no spelling issue anymore. There's no math issue anymore. And I think what really will happen
is that we can be super creative. And we are. We are creative. That's our secret weapon. 22:09CA: So the jobs that are getting lost, in a way, even though
it's going to be painful, humans are capable
of more than those jobs. This is the dream. The dream is that humans can rise
to just a new level of empowerment and discovery. That's the dream. 22:24ST: And think about this: if you look at the history of humanity, that might be whatever --
60-100,000 years old, give or take -- almost everything that you cherish
in terms of invention, of technology, of things we've built, has been invented in the last 150 years. If you toss in the book and the wheel,
it's a little bit older. Or the axe. But your phone, your sneakers, these chairs, modern
manufacturing, penicillin -- the things we cherish. Now, that to me means the next 150 years will find more things. In fact, the pace of invention
has gone up, not gone down, in my opinion. I believe only one percent of interesting
things have been invented yet. Right? We haven't cured cancer. We don't have flying cars -- yet.
Hopefully, I'll change this. That used to be an example
people laughed about. (Laughs) It's funny, isn't it?
Working secretly on flying cars. We don't live twice as long yet. OK? We don't have this magic
implant in our brain that gives us the information we want. And you might be appalled by it, but I promise you,
once you have it, you'll love it. I hope you will. It's a bit scary, I know. 23:36There are so many things
we haven't invented yet that I think we'll invent. We have no gravity shields. We can't beam ourselves
from one location to another. That sounds ridiculous, but about 200 years ago, experts were of the opinion
that flight wouldn't exist, even 120 years ago, and if you moved faster
than you could run, you would instantly die. So who says we are correct today
that you can't beam a person from here to Mars? 24:00CA: Sebastian, thank you so much for your incredibly inspiring vision
and your brilliance. Thank you, Sebastian Thrun. That was fantastic. (Applause)"
3,A funny look at the unintended consequences of technology,Chuck Nice,Feb 2018,"Technology should work for us, but what happens when it doesn't? Comedian Chuck Nice explores the unintended consequences of technological advancement and human interaction -- with hilarious results.", (30K),"Transcript (22 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Future tech always comes
with two things: promise and unintended consequences. And it's those consequences
that I want to explore. And before we get to how
future tech may affect us, I'd like to spend a little time
exploring the unintended consequences of some of our recent tech, namely, social media. Social media, a few short years ago,
was the tech of future you. Now it just is you. Social media was supposed
to bring us together in ways we could never imagine. And the predictors were correct. These three girls
are talking to one another without the awkward discomfort
of eye contact. 00:44(Laughter) 00:45I call that advancement. 00:49We were supposed to be caught up
in a communication tsunami, the likes of which the world
has never seen. And that did happen. And so did this. 01:01(Sings) One of these things
is not like the other. 01:04(Speaks) Now, look at this picture. If you picked the guy
with the book, you’re wrong -- or, as a certain president
would say, ""Wrong!"" 01:11(Laughter) 01:15Clearly, three of these guys are reading, and one guy, on the end,
is listening to music and playing ""Candy Crush."" 01:21(Laughter) 01:23So are we more connected, or are we just more connected
to our devices? Social media was supposed
to place us in a veritable town square, where we could engage one another
with challenging ideas and debates. And instead what we got were trolls. This is an actual tweet that I received. ""Chuck, no one wants to hear
your stupid, ill-informed political views! I hope you get leprosy and die. Love, Dad"" 01:54(Laughter) 01:56Now, the great thing
about that tweet if you look at it, just like most trolls, it's not that bad, because he wished ""leporsy"" on me
instead of ""leprosy,"" and ""leporsy"" is not dangerous at all. 02:08(Laughter) 02:09(Applause) 02:14Along with trolls, we got
a brand new way of torturing teenagers -- cyberbullying. A concept that my 75-year-old mother
just can't seem to wrap her head around. 02:26""So, uh, did they hit him?"" 02:28""No, Mom, they didn't hit him."" 02:30""Did they take his money?"" 02:31""No, Mom, they didn't take his money."" 02:33""Did they put his face in the toilet?"" 02:35""No, Mom, they didn't --"" 02:36""Well, what did they do?"" 02:38""They attacked him on the internet."" 02:40""Attacked him on the internet?"" 02:42(Laughter) 02:43""Well, why don't you just
turn off the internet?"" 02:45(Laughter) 02:47""Your whole generation
is a bunch of wussies."" 02:49(Laughter) 02:51She's got a point. 02:52(Laughter) 02:54She's got a point. 02:55And I don't even want to talk about
what social media has done to dating. I was on Grindr until I found out
it wasn't a sandwich app. 03:04(Laughter) 03:07And I can't even tell you about Tinder, except for the fact that
if you think there is a limit to the amount of anonymous sex
we can have on this planet, you are sadly mistaken. 03:20(Laughter) 03:21So where do we go from here? Well, let's just jump right in
and play the hits. Driverless cars. Something that has already
been around for many years, just without the assistance of computers. 03:32(Laughter) 03:35(Applause) Because for years, we have
been driving while texting, putting on makeup, shaving, reading -- actually reading -- that would be me. 03:48(Laughter) 03:49The other thing is that since
driverless cars will be shared, most people won't own cars, and that means the DMV will go away. The DMV -- I know what
you're saying right now. ""There's no way this guy
is going to stand up here and make a case for the DMV."" Well, I don't know about you,
but I do not want to live in a world where harsh fluorescent lights, endless lines, terrible forms to fill out and disaffected, soulless
bureaucrats remind me that I am pretty damn lucky
not to work here. 04:19(Laughter) 04:21That is the real service they provide. The DMV: come for the registration renewal, stay for the satisfaction of knowing
you made some pretty good life choices. 04:32(Laughter) 04:37Nobody will own their car in the future, and that means teenagers
will not have a place to make out. So you know what that means. That means they will order
driverless cars to do just that. I do not want to step into a vehicle
and ask the question: ""Why does this car smell like
awkwardness, failure and shame?"" 04:57(Laughter) 05:00If I want to ask that question,
I'll walk into my own bedroom. 05:03(Laughter) 05:05So what else do we have
to look forward to? That's right, artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, yes. You know, there was a time
when artificial intelligence was a joke. I mean, literally a quip
that you would hear at a cocktail party when somebody would
bring it up in conversation: ""Artificial intelligence. The only real artificial intelligence
is our American Congress. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."" Well, it's not funny anymore. 05:29(Laughter) 05:36Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk
and Bill Gates have all gone on record expressing grave reservations
about artificial intelligence. That's like Jesus, Moses and Muhammad
coming together and saying, ""Guy, guys -- here's something
we can all believe in."" 05:50(Laughter) 05:51You might want to go with that,
is all I'm saying. We are actually teaching
machines how to think, how to understand our behavior, how to defend themselves
and even practice deception. What could possibly go wrong? 06:08(Laughter) 06:11The one thing that's for sure: the creation always despises its creator. OK? The Titans rose up against the gods; Lucifer against Jehovah. And anybody who has a teenager
has heard these words: ""I hate you and you're ruining my life! I hate you!"" Now just imagine that sentiment
with a machine that can outthink you and is heavily armed. 06:36(Laughter) 06:39The result? Absolutely. 06:42(Laughter) 06:46What we need to do before we perfect
artificial intelligence is perfect artificial emotions. That way, we can teach
the robots or machines how to love us unconditionally, so that when they figure out
that the only real problem on this planet is us, instead of destroying us -- which, by the way, is totally logical -- they will find us adorable -- 07:12(Laughter) 07:13like baby poop. 07:14(Laughter) 07:15""Oh my god, I just love the way
you just destroyed the planet. I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute! You're so cute!"" 07:22(Laughter) 07:24Can't talk about this without
talking about robotics. OK? Remember when you thought
robotics were cool? I remember when I thought
robotics were cool, until I figured out that they were
going to take everybody's place, from the delivery guy
down to the heart surgeon. The one thing, though,
that is very disappointing about robotics is the holy grail of robotics, and it hasn't even happened. I'm talking about the robot girlfriend, the dream of one lonely geek
in a windowless basement who vowed one day:
""I am going to marry my creation."" And there actually is a movement underway
to stop this from happening, for fear of exploitation. And I, for one, am against that movement. I believe we should
have robot girlfriends. I just believe that they should come
with a feminist protocol and artificial intelligence, so she can take one look at that guy
and go, ""I am too good for you. I'm leaving."" 08:23(Laughter) 08:24(Applause) 08:28And finally, I have to talk about bioengineering, an area of science that promises
to end disease before it even begins, to help us live longer,
fuller, healthier lives. And when you couple that
with implantable hardware, you are looking at the next incarnation
of human evolution. And all of that sounds great, until you figure out
where it's really going. One place: designer babies, where, no matter
where you are on the globe or what your ethnicity, babies will end up looking like that. 09:07(Laughter) 09:09That boy is surprised because he just found out
both his parents are black. 09:15(Laughter) 09:23Can you imagine him
at a cocktail party in 20 years? ""Yeah, both my parents are black. I mean, it's a little awkward at times, but you should see my credit rating. Impressive, very impressive."" 09:34(Laughter) 09:37Now, all of this seems scary, and everybody in this room
knows that it isn't. Technology isn't scary. Never has been and it never will be. What's scary is us and what we will do with technology. Will we allow it to expose our humanity, showing our true selves and reinforcing the fact
that we are indeed our brother's keeper? Or will we allow it to reveal
our deepest, darkest demons? 10:10The true question is not
whether or not technology is scary. The true question is: How human are you? 10:21Thank you. 10:22(Applause)"
3,Could you recover from illness ... using your own stem cells?,Nabiha Saklayen,Sep 2021,"What if diseases could be treated with a patient's own cells, precisely and on demand? Biotech entrepreneur Nabiha Saklayen explains how we could harness advances in biology, machine learning and lasers to create personalized stem cell banks -- and develop medicine uniquely designed for each of our bodies.", (61K),"Transcript (15 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtΕλληνικάעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01You're sitting in the doctor's office
waiting for test results. She comes in and says, ""You have Parkinson's disease."" Your heart sinks, and you think about
everything that will go wrong: you'll be unable to walk, unable to feed
yourself, your hands trembling, drooling, unable to swallow. But before you say anything, she says, ""Not to worry, we'll put
in an order for your cells today."" You come back a week later, and a surgeon transplants
brand new neurons into your brain. You just received an on-demand
functional cure for Parkinson's, made from your cells. 00:49It sounds like science fiction,
but in the future, we will all have the option of having
our stem cells banked ahead of time so that any time you need new neurons,
new muscle cells, new skin cells, they'd be generated from this bank. And because they're
100 percent your cells, your immune system is extremely unlikely
to reject or attack those cells. In fact, the body has no idea that these cells were
actually made in a cell factory. All of this is possible
because of a breakthrough at the intersection of biology,
laser physics and machine learning. 01:30We'll start with biology. The human body is an absolute miracle. Trillions of cells are working
in synchronicity to pump blood, secrete dopamine and let me see and speak to you right now. But as we age, our cells age, too. That's why our skin starts to sag, our cartilage wears away, and your five-mile run
might turn into a 20-minute walk. Yes, we're all getting older. Our bodies are ticking time bombs. But stem cells could offer a solution, because one stem cell can become
almost any cell in your body. 02:12My grandma passed away
due to diabetes in 2012. If the technology
were available at the time, we could have used her stem cells
to generate new pancreatic cells, and it could have cured her. 02:26Now, unfortunately, stem cells
are notoriously difficult to engineer. One fundamental problem
relates to how they're made, which involves taking
a patient's blood cells and adding chemicals to those blood cells
to turn them into stem cells. Now, during this chemical process, you never end up with
a perfect set of stem cells. In fact, you get a very messy plate
of cells going in different directions -- towards the eye, brain, liver -- and every random cell must be removed. 02:58Until recently, the main way
to remove cells was by hand. I remember the first time I visited
the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. I watched a highly skilled scientist
sitting at a bench looking at stem cells, evaluating them one at a time and removing the unwanted cells by hand. It's a slow, tedious
and artisanal process, which is why generating
a personalized stem cell bank today costs about one million dollars. 03:31Now, using a donor's stem cells
is much cheaper, but your immune system will likely
attack or reject those cells unless you take immunosuppressants, which, unfortunately, is not an option
for a lot of people, especially the elderly. To avoid this problem, some scientists are banking stem cells from individuals with the most
common genetic backgrounds. Here in the US, let's say we made a cell bank
with 100 of the most common cell lines. It could work for about
75 percent of Caucasians, 50 percent of African Americans. But it gets harder. My cofounder is Filipina-Mexican, and it's unclear if she would
be ever covered by a bank. And regardless, if you could choose between using
a stranger's cells versus your own, wouldn't you choose your own? 04:31Personalized stem cells
are our opportunity to make medicines that truly work
for me, for you and everyone. And in order to make this process of stem
cell production affordable and scalable, we have to automate it. Different people are taking
different approaches to doing that, and I decided to use physics. Since childhood, I've been
a die-hard physics fan, gazing at the stars, daydreaming about space travel. Thanks, Mom, for not thinking I was weird! My family moved around a lot, from Saudi Arabia to Germany
to Sri Lanka to Bangladesh, and each time, I had to learn
new languages and cultures. Eventually, I fell in love with physics
because it was a universal language that I didn't have to relearn every time. 05:23When I started my PhD,
I joined a laser physics lab, because lasers are the coolest. But I also decided to dabble in biology. I started using lasers
to engineer human cells, and when I talked to biologists
about it, they were amazed. Here's why: scientists are always looking
for ways to make biology more precise. Sometimes cell culture
can feel a lot like cooking: take some chemicals, put it in a pot,
stir it, heat it, see what happens, try it all over again. In contrast, lasers are so precise, you can target one cell in millions
at precise intervals -- every second, every minute,
every hour -- you name it. I realized that instead of doing
this tedious process of stem cell culture by hand, we could use lasers to remove
the unwanted cells. And to automate the entire process, we decided to use machine learning
to identify those unwanted cells and zap them. Algorithms today are great at finding
useful information and images, making this a perfect use case
for machine learning. 06:34Here's how it works: Take some blood cells,
put it in a cassette. Add chemicals to those blood cells to turn
them into stem cells like always. Now, instead of having a human
look for those unwanted cells and remove them by hand, the machine identifies the unwanted cells and zaps them with a laser. As you can see, this entire process
happens by machine. The computer decides when
and how often to print the cells and uses a fully automated system
to run the process. After repeated pruning, you end up with a perfect culture
of your stem cells, ready to be banked and used at any time. In the future, we're going to have
stem cell farms with stacks and stacks of hundreds
and then eventually millions of cassettes, each cassette a personalized
bank for one human. Nurses will take a sample
of your cord blood right at birth and ship it off for cultivation, so that for the rest of your life,
your stem cells are on file, banked, ready to go, should any
medical need arise. Let's say you develop heart disease. Your doctor can order up new heart cells. Hair loss. They can order up new hair. 07:50The most immediate application
of this technology is for implants. Dr. Kapil Bharti's research
at the National Eye Institute has informed a breakthrough clinical trial for a stem cell derived
therapy for blindness. As the process becomes cheaper, scientists can run larger and larger
clinical trials at scale to develop new treatments
that don't exist today, because what costs
one million dollars today will soon be less than 50,000, and then even cheaper with time. 08:23Now, it gets even more
interesting than that. And perhaps you have longevity in mind. That is certainly a possibility. In the future, we might use
these exact same stem cell banks to generate entire new organs,
new tissues, new skin ... New bone, teeth, anyone? This technology also has the potential to revolutionize
personalized pharmaceuticals. Today, taking medicine is,
to some degree, trial and error. You don't really know
if the drug is going to work for you until you put it in your body. But what if we had a miniature
human replica of you with your cells -- eye cells, brain cells, heart cells,
muscle cells, blood cells -- on a chip? A miniature human replica of you. We could take the drugs, test
them on the cells in the lab first to see how it works. If it works, fantastic.
Go ahead and take the drug. If it doesn't, pharmacists can
order up custom drugs just for you. This has been the hope and dream
of scientists for decades. 09:41With this technology, we can finally realize
the true potential of stem cells: on-demand functional cures
made from your cells. Cures that your body won't reject. Cures that truly work for everyone. The future of regenerative medicine
is 100 percent personalized, and it's a lot closer than you think. 10:12Thank you. 10:14(Applause)"
3,The real reason for brains,Daniel Wolpert,Nov 2011,"Neuroscientist Daniel Wolpert starts from a surprising premise: the brain evolved, not to think or feel, but to control movement. In this entertaining, data-rich talk he gives us a glimpse into how the brain creates the grace and agility of human motion.", (64K),"Transcript (30 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I'm a neuroscientist. And in neuroscience, we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain. But I want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life, because it's a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function. And that is, why do we and other animals have brains? Not all species on our planet have brains, so if we want to know what the brain is for, let's think about why we evolved one. Now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think, and that's completely wrong. If you think about this question for any length of time, it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain. We have a brain for one reason and one reason only, and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements. There is no other reason to have a brain. Think about it. Movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you. Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating. But apart from that, everything else goes through contractions of muscles. 00:59So think about communication -- speech, gestures, writing, sign language -- they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles. So it's really important to remember that sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important, but they're only important to either drive or suppress future movements. There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life. 01:26Now for those who don't believe this argument, we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain, but the clinching evidence is this animal here -- the humble sea squirt. Rudimentary animal, has a nervous system, swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life. And at some point of its life, it implants on a rock. And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves, is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food. So once you don't need to move, you don't need the luxury of that brain. And this animal is often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure, but that's a different subject. 02:04(Applause) 02:06So I am a movement chauvinist. I believe movement is the most important function of the brain -- don't let anyone tell you that it's not true. Now if movement is so important, how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement? And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem. But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do. 02:27Think about the game of chess. How well are we doing determining what piece to move where? If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail, against IBM's Deep Blue, well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win. And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time. That problem is solved. What about the problem of picking up a chess piece, dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board? If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today, the answer is simple: the child wins easily. There's no competition at all. 03:01Now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard? One reason is a very smart five year-old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem -- look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win. So it's a very simple algorithm. Now of course there are other moves, but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution. When it comes to being dexterous, it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous. And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world, which has a lot of problems. 03:29But let me show you cutting-edge robotics. Now a lot of robotics is very impressive, but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes. And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass. It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it. But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human. Now if you want this robot to do a different task, that's another three-year Ph.D. program. There is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics. 04:00Now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance. So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking. Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking. It's a high school sport where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order. And this is her getting the world record in real time. (Laughter) (Applause) And she's pretty happy. We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that, and that's what we'd like to know. 04:43So in my group, what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement. And it sounds like an easy problem. You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract. Your arm or body moves, and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on. The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be. So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy. Now by noise, I do not mean sound. We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal. So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard ""crrcckkk"" on the station you wanted to hear, that was the noise. But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal. 05:23So for example, if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand, you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. Similarly, when you put motor output on movement output, it's extremely noisy. Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts, just aim for the same spot over and over again. You have a huge spread due to movement variability. And more than that, the outside world, or task, is both ambiguous and variable. The teapot could be full, it could be empty. It changes over time. So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise. 05:54Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise. So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick, our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars. 06:12Now what I want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability. And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years called Bayesian decision theory. And it's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty. And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions. 06:36So let's think about the inference. You want to generate beliefs about the world. So what are beliefs? Beliefs could be: where are my arms in space? Am I looking at a cat or a fox? But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities. So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one -- zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain. And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty. And the key idea to Bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference. You have data, and data in neuroscience is sensory input. So I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs. But there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge. You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories. And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs. 07:28And I've put the formula up there. I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful. And it has real beauty and real explanatory power. And what it really says, and what you want to estimate, is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input. So let me give you an intuitive example. Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you. There are two sources of information Bayes' rule tells you. There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information, and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. But you know that your senses are not perfect, and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red, representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1. 08:11That information is available in the current shot, but there's another source of information not available on the current shot, but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis, and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match. If you're playing against a very good opponent, they may distribute it in that green area, which is the prior distribution, making it hard for you to return. Now both these sources of information carry important information. And what Bayes' rule says is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses, and that's my belief. So it's the optimal way of combining information. 08:47Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago, we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills. And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines. As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down, but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is, and then combine those in a real Bayesian way. 09:09Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula. And what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs. So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get. And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do. And to do that, I'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input. So you send a command out, you get sensory feedback back, and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus. 09:45But you can imagine looking inside the brain. And here's inside the brain. You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator, of the physics of your body and your senses. So as you send a movement command down, you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions. So as I shake this ketchup bottle, I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row. And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing. 10:11Well why would I bother doing that? I'm going to get the same feedback anyway. Well there's good reasons. Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle, someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me. Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act. So I get two sources. I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it, but from my senses' point of view, that is combined together into one source of information. 10:36Now there's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events. Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that's going on inside my body. So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction -- which is only based on your movement commands -- with the reality. Any discrepancy should hopefully be external. So as I go around the world, I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off. Everything left over is external to me. 11:05What evidence is there for this? Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person. And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling. It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can. But it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator, simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense. So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem. And in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot, and they're going to move that back and forward. And then we're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot, which is going to tickle their palm with another stick. And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness. 11:49I'll show you just one part of our study. And here I've taken away the robots, but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay. Either no time delay, in which case light would just tickle your palm, or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second. So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement. The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle. All we're playing with is a tempo causality. And as we go from naught to 0.1 second, it becomes more ticklish. As you go from 0.1 to 0.2, it becomes more ticklish at the end. And by 0.2 of a second, it's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything. So whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality. And based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations. 12:44Now I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run. Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes, you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena. And in the intervening years I had two daughters. And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys, they get into fights -- which started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating. It quickly escalates. And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force. Now when I screamed at my children to stop, sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder. 13:19Now I happen to know my children don't lie, so I thought, as a neuroscientist, it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths. And we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another, they generate the movement command. They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off. So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have -- rather like the tickling. Whereas the passive recipient doesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow. So if they retaliate with the same force, the first person will think it's been escalated. 13:48So we decided to test this in the lab. (Laughter) Now we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting, but the concept is identical. We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game. And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. And the game is very simple. We started with a motor with a little lever, a little force transfuser. And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that. And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force. Use your other hand to apply the force back down. And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. 14:33But critically, they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms. So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by. And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms. And if we look at what we start with, a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns, perfect would be that red line. And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go. So it really suggests, when you're doing this -- based on this study and others we've done -- that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. So it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts. So we've made inferences, we've done predictions, now we have to generate actions. And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs, the action should in some sense be optimal. 15:19But we've got a problem. Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance -- but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles in a particular sequence. And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system. So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways. So think about just a point to point movement. I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths. Having chosen a particular path, I can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations. And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed. So I have a huge amount of choice to make. Now it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical. We all move the same way pretty much. 15:59And so it turns out we're so stereotypical, our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping. So if I take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion, your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on. Now this is a bunch of dots moving. You will know what this person is doing, whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information. If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit, you would have absolutely no idea what's going on. 16:26So why is it that we move the particular ways we do? Well let's think about what really happens. Maybe we don't all quite move the same way. Maybe there's variation in the population. And maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation. So in evolutionary scales, movements get better. And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning. 16:47So what is it about a movement which is good or bad? Imagine I want to intercept this ball. Here are two possible paths to that ball. Well if I choose the left-hand path, I can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time. But there's noise added to this. So what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force, is a very noisy version. So if I pick the same command through many times, I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time. So what I can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if I choose that way. If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then I'll have a different command, different noise, playing through a noisy system, very complicated. All we can be sure of is the variability will be different. If I move in this particular way, I end up with a smaller variability across many movements. So if I have to choose between those two, I would choose the right one because it's less variable. 17:39And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise. And one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger. So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. So we've shown that using this, we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise. 18:05So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement. And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that. But it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation. There are many diseases which effect movement. And hopefully if we understand how we control movement, we can apply that to robotic technology. And finally, I want to remind you, when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks, the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. 18:31Thank you very much. 18:33(Applause) 18:41Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan. So you're a movement -- (DW: Chauvinist.) -- chauvinist. Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about -- the dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things -- are a kind of side show, an accident? 18:56DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end. So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example, is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. 19:15CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally, could get real insight by saying, where does movement play in this game? 19:22DW: So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake. You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision. And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way. 19:34CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. 19:37(Applause)"
3,How AI is making it easier to diagnose disease,Pratik Shah,Jul 2018,"Today's AI algorithms require tens of thousands of expensive medical images to detect a patient's disease.

are performing incredible tasks with high accuracies, at a massive scale,
using human-like intelligence. And this intelligence of computers
is often referred to as AI or artificial intelligence. AI is poised to make an incredible impact
on our lives in the future. Today, however,
we still face massive challenges in detecting and diagnosing
several life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases and cancer. Thousands of patients every year lose their lives
due to liver and oral cancer. 00:37Our best way to help these patients is to perform early detection
and diagnoses of these diseases. So how do we detect these diseases today,
and can artificial intelligence help? In patients who, unfortunately,
are suspected of these diseases, an expert physician first orders very expensive
medical imaging technologies such as fluorescent imaging,
CTs, MRIs, to be performed. Once those images are collected, another expert physician then diagnoses
those images and talks to the patient. As you can see, this is
a very resource-intensive process, requiring both expert physicians,
expensive medical imaging technologies, and is not considered practical
for the developing world. And in fact, in many
industrialized nations, as well. 01:27So, can we solve this problem
using artificial intelligence? Today, if I were to use traditional
artificial intelligence architectures to solve this problem, I would require 10,000 -- I repeat, on an order of 10,000
of these very expensive medical images first to be generated. After that, I would then go
to an expert physician, who would then analyze
those images for me. And using those two pieces of information, I can train a standard deep neural network
or a deep learning network to provide patient's diagnosis. Similar to the first approach, traditional artificial
intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. Large amounts of data, expert physicians
and expert medical imaging technologies. 02:08So, can we invent more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial
intelligence architectures to solve these very important
problems facing us today? And this is exactly
what my group at MIT Media Lab does. We have invented a variety
of unorthodox AI architectures to solve some of the most important
challenges facing us today in medical imaging and clinical trials. 02:32In the example I shared
with you today, we had two goals. Our first goal was to reduce
the number of images required to train
artificial intelligence algorithms. Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, we wanted to reduce the use
of expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients. So how did we do it? 02:50For our first goal, instead of starting
with tens and thousands of these very expensive medical images,
like traditional AI, we started with a single medical image. From this image, my team and I
figured out a very clever way to extract billions
of information packets. These information packets
included colors, pixels, geometry and rendering of the disease
on the medical image. In a sense, we converted one image
into billions of training data points, massively reducing the amount of data
needed for training. 03:20For our second goal, to reduce the use of expensive medical
imaging technologies to screen patients, we started with a standard,
white light photograph, acquired either from a DSLR camera
or a mobile phone, for the patient. Then remember those
billions of information packets? We overlaid those from
the medical image onto this image, creating something
that we call a composite image. Much to our surprise,
we only required 50 -- I repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images to train
our algorithms to high efficiencies. 03:50To summarize our approach, instead of using 10,000
very expensive medical images, we can now train the AI algorithms
in an unorthodox way, using only 50 of these high-resolution,
but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras
and mobile phones, and provide diagnosis. More importantly, our algorithms can accept,
in the future and even right now, some very simple, white light
photographs from the patient, instead of expensive
medical imaging technologies. 04:17I believe that we are poised
to enter an era where artificial intelligence is going to make an incredible
impact on our future. And I think that thinking
about traditional AI, which is data-rich but application-poor, we should also continue thinking about unorthodox artificial
intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data and solve some of the most important
problems facing us today, especially in health care. 04:40Thank you very much. 04:42(Applause)"
3,How AI could compose a personalized soundtrack to your life,Pierre Barreau,Sep 2018,"Meet AIVA, an artificial intelligence that has been trained in the art of music composition by reading more than 30,000 of history's greatest scores. In a mesmerizing talk and demo, Pierre Barreau plays compositions created by AIVA and shares his dream: to create original live soundtracks based on our moods and personalities.", (47K),"Transcript (21 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00About two and a half years ago,
I watched this movie called ""Her."" And it features Samantha,
a superintelligent form of AI that cannot take physical form. And because she can't
appear in photographs, Samantha decides to write a piece of music that will capture a moment of her life
just like a photograph would. 00:20As a musician and an engineer,
and someone raised in a family of artists, I thought that this idea of musical
photographs was really powerful. And I decided to create an AI composer. Her name is AIVA,
and she's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art
of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores
of history's greatest. So here's what one score
looks like to the algorithm in a matrix-like representation. And here's what 30,000 scores, written by the likes
of Mozart and Beethoven, look like in a single frame. 00:55So, using deep neural networks,
AIVA looks for patterns in the scores. And from a couple of bars
of existing music, it actually tries to infer what notes
should come next in those tracks. And once AIVA gets good
at those predictions, it can actually build a set
of mathematical rules for that style of music in order to create
its own original compositions. 01:18And in a way, this is kind of
how we, humans, compose music, too. It's a trial-and-error process, during which we may not
get the right notes all the time. But we can correct ourselves, either with our musical ear
or our musical knowledge. But for AIVA, this process
is taken from years and years of learning, decades of learning as an artist,
as a musician and a composer, down to a couple of hours. 01:43But music is also a supersubjective art. And we needed to teach AIVA how to compose the right music
for the right person, because people have different preferences. And to do that, we show to the algorithm
over 30 different category labels for each score in our database. So those category labels are like mood or note density or composer
style of a piece or the epoch during which it was written. And by seeing all this data, AIVA can actually respond
to very precise requirements. 02:11Like the ones, for example,
we had for a project recently, where we were commissioned
to create a piece that would be reminiscent
of a science-fiction film soundtrack. And the piece that was created
is called ""Among the Stars"" and it was recorded
with CMG Orchestra in Hollywood, under great conductor John Beal, and this is what they
recorded, made by AIVA. 02:35(Music) 03:18(Music ends) 03:22What do you think? 03:23(Applause) 03:28Thank you. 03:30So, as you've seen, AI can create
beautiful pieces of music, and the best part of it is that humans can actually
bring them to life. And it's not the first time in history that technology has augmented
human creativity. Live music was almost always
used in silent films to augment the experience. 03:49But the problem with live music
is that it didn't scale. It's really hard to cram a full symphony
into a small theater, and it's really hard to do that
for every theater in the world. So when music recording
was actually invented, it allowed content creators,
like film creators, to have prerecorded and original music tailored to each and every frame
of their stories. And that was really
an enhancer of creativity. 04:14Two and a half years ago,
when I watched this movie ""Her,"" I thought to myself
that personalized music would be the next single biggest change
in how we consume and create music. Because nowadays, we have
interactive content, like video games, that have hundreds of hours
of interactive game plays, but only two hours of music, on average. And it means that the music
loops and loops and loops over and over again,
and it's not very immersive. So what we're working on
is to make sure that AI can compose hundreds of hours of personalized music for those use cases
where human creativity doesn't scale. 04:51And we don't just want
to do that for games. Beethoven actually wrote a piece
for his beloved, called ""Für Elise,"" and imagine if we could
bring back Beethoven to life. And if he was sitting next to you,
composing a music for your personality and your life story. 05:10Or imagine if someone like
Martin Luther King, for example, had a personalized AI composer. Maybe then we would remember ""I Have a Dream"" not only
as a great speech, but also as a great piece of music,
part of our history, and capturing Dr. King's ideals. 05:24And this is our vision at AIVA: to personalize music
so that each and every one of you and every individual in the world can have access to a personalized
live soundtrack, based on their story
and their personality. So this moment here together at TED
is now part of our life story. So it only felt fitting that AIVA
would compose music for this moment. And that's exactly what we did. So my team and I worked on biasing AIVA
on the style of the TED jingle, and on music that makes us feel
a sense of awe and wonder. And the result is called
""The Age of Amazement."" Didn't take an AI to figure that one out. 06:04(Laughter) 06:06And I couldn't be more proud
to show it to you, so if you can, close your eyes
and enjoy the music. 06:11Thank you very much. 06:13(Music) 06:23[The Age of Amazement
Composed by AIVA] 08:07(Music ends) 08:08This was for all of you. 08:10Thank you. 08:11(Applause)"
3,How we're using AI to discover new antibiotics,Jim Collins,May 2020,"Before the coronavirus pandemic, bioengineer Jim Collins and his team combined the power of AI with synthetic biology in an effort to combat a different looming crisis: antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Collins explains how they pivoted their efforts to begin developing a series of tools and antiviral compounds to help fight COVID-19 -- and shares their plan to discover seven new classes of antibiotics over the next seven years. (This ambitious plan is part of The Audacious Project,...", (59K),"Transcript (26 Languages)CatalàDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00So how are we going to beat
this novel coronavirus? By using our best tools: our science and our technology. In my lab, we're using
the tools of artificial intelligence and synthetic biology to speed up the fight
against this pandemic. Our work was originally designed to tackle the antibiotic
resistance crisis. Our project seeks to harness
the power of machine learning to replenish our antibiotic arsenal and avoid a globally devastating
postantibiotic era. Importantly, the same
technology can be used to search for antiviral compounds that could help us fight
the current pandemic. 00:42Machine learning is turning
the traditional model of drug discovery on its head. With this approach, instead of painstakingly testing
thousands of existing molecules one by one in a lab for their effectiveness, we can train a computer
to explore the exponentially larger space of essentially all possible molecules
that could be synthesized, and thus, instead of looking
for a needle in a haystack, we can use the giant magnet
of computing power to find many needles
in multiple haystacks simultaneously. 01:18footnotefootnoteWe've already had some early success. Recently, we used machine learning
to discover new antibiotics that can help us fight off
the bacterial infections that can occur alongside
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Two months ago, TED's Audacious Project
approved funding for us to massively scale up our work with the goal of discovering
seven new classes of antibiotics against seven of the world's
deadly bacterial pathogens over the next seven years. For context: the number of new class of antibiotics that have been discovered
over the last three decades is zero. 01:58While the quest for new antibiotics
is for our medium-term future, the novel coronavirus poses
an immediate deadly threat, and I'm excited to share that we think
we can use the same technology to search for therapeutics
to fight this virus. So how are we going to do it? Well, we're creating
a compound training library and with collaborators applying these
molecules to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to see which of them exhibit
effective activity. These data will be use to train
a machine learning model that will be applied to an in silico
library of over a billion molecules to search for potential
novel antiviral compounds. We will synthesize and test
the top predictions and advance the most promising
candidates into the clinic. 02:46Sound too good to be true? Well, it shouldn't. The Antibiotics AI Project is founded
on our proof of concept research that led to the discovery
of a novel broad-spectrum antibiotic called halicin. Halicin has potent antibacterial activity against almost all antibiotic-resistant
bacterial pathogens, including untreatable
panresistant infections. Importantly, in contrast
to current antibiotics, the frequency at which bacteria
develop resistance against halicin is remarkably low. We tested the ability of bacteria
to evolve resistance against halicin as well as Cipro in the lab. In the case of Cipro, after just one day, we saw resistance. In the case of halicin, after one day,
we didn't see any resistance. Amazingly, after even 30 days, we didn't see any resistance
against halicin. 03:41In this pilot project, we first tested
roughly 2,500 compounds against E. coli. This training set included
known antibiotics, such as Cipro and penicillin, as well as many drugs
that are not antibiotics. These data we used to train a model to learn molecular features
associated with antibacterial activity. We then applied this model
to a drug-repurposing library consisting of several thousand molecules and asked the model to identify molecules that are predicted
to have antibacterial properties but don't look like existing antibiotics. Interestingly, only one molecule
in that library fit these criteria, and that molecule
turned out to be halicin. Given that halicin does not look
like any existing antibiotic, it would have been impossible for a human,
including an antibiotic expert, to identify halicin in this manner. Imagine now what we could do
with this technology against SARS-CoV-2. 04:39footnotefootnoteAnd that's not all. We're also using the tools
of synthetic biology, tinkering with DNA
and other cellular machinery, to serve human purposes
like combating COVID-19, and of note, we are working
to develop a protective mask that can also serve
as a rapid diagnostic test. So how does that work? Well, we recently showed that you can take the cellular
machinery out of a living cell and freeze-dry it along with
RNA sensors onto paper in order to create low-cost
diagnostics for Ebola and Zika. The sensors are activated when
they're rehydrated by a patient sample that could consist of blood
or saliva, for example. It turns out, this technology
is not limited to paper and can be applied
to other materials, including cloth. For the COVID-19 pandemic, we're designing RNA sensors
to detect the virus and freeze-drying these
along with the needed cellular machinery into the fabric of a face mask, where the simple act of breathing, along with the water vapor
that comes with it, can activate the test. Thus, if a patient is infected
with SARS-CoV-2, the mask will produce
a fluorescent signal that could be detected by a simple,
inexpensive handheld device. In one or two hours, a patient
could thus be diagnosed safely, remotely and accurately. 06:06footnotefootnoteWe're also using synthetic biology to design a candidate
vaccine for COVID-19. We are repurposing the BCG vaccine, which had been used against TB
for almost a century. It's a live attenuated vaccine, and we're engineering it
to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which should trigger the production
of protective antibodies by the immune system. Importantly, BCG
is massively scalable and has a safety profile that's among
the best of any reported vaccine. 06:37With the tools of synthetic biology
and artificial intelligence, we can win the fight
against this novel coronavirus. This work is in its very early stages,
but the promise is real. Science and technology
can give us an important advantage in the battle of human wits
versus the genes of superbugs, a battle we can win. 06:59Thank you."
3,How I'm using biological data to tell better stories — and spark social change,Heidi Boisvert,Dec 2019,"What kinds of stories move us to act? To answer this question, creative technologist Heidi Boisvert is measuring how people's brains and bodies unconsciously respond to different media. She shows how she's using this data to determine the specific narrative ingredients that inspire empathy and justice -- and spark large-scale social change.", (61K),"Transcript (21 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийУкраїнськаالعربيةفارسىမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01footnotefootnoteFor the past 15 years I've been trying
to change your mind. In my work I harness pop culture
and emerging technology to shift cultural norms. I've made video games
to promote human rights, I've made animations to raise awareness
about unfair immigration laws and I've even made location-based
augmented reality apps to change perceptions around homelessness well before Pokémon Go. 00:29(Laughter) 00:30But then I began to wonder
whether a game or an app can really change attitudes and behaviors, and if so, can I measure that change? What's the science behind that process? So I shifted my focus
from making media and technology to measuring their
neurobiological effects. 00:51footnotefootnoteHere's what I discovered. The web, mobile devices,
virtual and augmented reality were rescripting our nervous systems. And they were literally changing
the structure of our brain. The very technologies I had been using
to positively influence hearts and minds were actually eroding functions
in the brain necessary for empathy and decision-making. In fact, our dependence
upon the web and mobile devices might be taking over
our cognitive and affective faculties, rendering us socially
and emotionally incompetent, and I felt complicit
in this dehumanization. 01:31I realized that before I could continue
making media about social issues, I needed to reverse engineer
the harmful effects of technology. To tackle this I asked myself, ""How can I translate
the mechanisms of empathy, the cognitive, affective
and motivational aspects, into an engine that simulates
the narrative ingredients that move us to act?"" To answer this, I had to build a machine. 02:00(Laughter) 02:02I've been developing
an open-source biometric lab, an AI system which I call the Limbic Lab. The lab not only captures the brain and body's unconscious response
to media and technology but also uses machine learning
to adapt content based on these biological responses. 02:20My goal is to find out what combination
of narrative ingredients are the most appealing and galvanizing to specific target audiences to enable social justice, cultural
and educational organizations to create more effective media. 02:35The Limbic Lab consists of two components: a narrative engine and a media machine. While a subject is viewing
or interacting with media content, the narrative engine takes in and syncs
real-time data from brain waves, biophysical data like heart rate,
blood flow, body temperature and muscle contraction, as well as eye-tracking
and facial expressions. Data is captured at key places
where critical plot points, character interaction
or unusual camera angles occur. Like the final scene
in ""Game of Thrones, Red Wedding,"" when shockingly, everybody dies. 03:14(Laughter) 03:17Survey data on that
person's political beliefs, along with their psychographic
and demographic data, are integrated into the system to gain a deeper understanding
of the individual. 03:28footnotefootnoteLet me give you an example. Matching people's TV preferences
with their views on social justice issues reveals that Americans who rank
immigration among their top three concerns are more likely to be fans
of ""The Walking Dead,"" and they often watch
for the adrenaline boost, which is measurable. 03:49A person's biological signature
and their survey response combines into a database
to create their unique media imprint. Then our predictive model
finds patterns between media imprints and tells me which narrative ingredients are more likely to lead
to engagement in altruistic behavior rather than distress and apathy. The more imprints added to the database across mediums from episodic
television to games, the better the predictive models become. In short, I am mapping
the first media genome. 04:24(Applause and cheers) 04:32Whereas the human genome
identifies all genes involved in sequencing human DNA, the growing database of media imprints
will eventually allow me to determine the media DNA
for a specific person. 04:46Already the Limbic Lab's narrative engine helps content creators
refine their storytelling, so that it resonates with their target
audiences on an individual level. 04:59The Limbic Lab's other component, the media machine, will assess how media elicits
an emotional and physiological response, then pulls scenes from a content library targeted to person-specific media DNA. 05:14Applying artificial intelligence
to biometric data creates a truly personalized experience. One that adapts content based
on real-time unconscious responses. Imagine if nonprofits and media makers
were able to measure how audiences feel as they experience it and alter content on the fly. I believe this is the future of media. 05:41To date, most media
and social-change strategies have attempted to appeal
to mass audiences, but the future is media
customized for each person. As real-time measurement
of media consumption and automated media production
becomes the norm, we will soon be consuming media
tailored directly to our cravings using a blend of psychographics,
biometrics and AI. It's like personalized medicine
based on our DNA. I call it ""biomedia."" 06:13I am currently testing
the Limbic Lab in a pilot study with the Norman Lear Center, which looks at the top 50
episodic television shows. But I am grappling
with an ethical dilemma. If I design a tool
that can be turned into a weapon, should I build it? By open-sourcing the lab
to encourage access and inclusivity, I also run the risk
of enabling powerful governments and profit-driven companies
to appropriate the platform for fake news, marketing
or other forms of mass persuasion. For me, therefore,
it is critical to make my research as transparent to
lay audiences as GMO labels. However, this is not enough. As creative technologists, we have a responsibility not only to reflect upon how present
technology shapes our cultural values and social behavior, but also to actively challenge
the trajectory of future technology. It is my hope that we make
an ethical commitment to harvesting the body's intelligence for the creation of authentic
and just stories that transform media and technology from harmful weapons
into narrative medicine. 07:30Thank you. 07:32(Applause and cheers)"

Instead, he believes developments in artificial intelligence will make all of our lives better, healthier and safer. He takes us on a tour of the next 20 years of AI and shares some astonishing predictions for the advancements in science and technology that could await us.

The world is even stranger than fiction. Full of astonishing technologies
and scientific advances. But there's still one thing
that is very familiar. COVID is still with us. We've just figured out
how to live with it. You haven't been outside
of your apartment for three years. The pandemic of 2021 traumatized you. You still have the nightmares
about losing your grandparents and despite advances, fear of infection has kept you
inside and isolated. You've just found out that the lover you met
in an immersive online game has flown halfway
around the world to meet you. But now he's quarantined in the hospital, stricken with a new, extremely virulent variant of the virus. It looks like he might die
even before you met him. You decide you've got to venture out, into the dangerous world
beyond your four walls. 01:21Luckily, there are robots to help you. Your housekeeping robot
takes you to a special elevator reserved for robots only, allowing you to completely avoid people. It’s crammed with all manners of bots. DeliveryBot, CleaningBot, SeniorCareBot,
DogWalkingBot, even the walls and ceiling
are covered with DisinfectionBots that resemble insects. 01:54You cautiously step out on the street
for the first time, eyeing the passers-by with suspicion. You rely on your Safety Circle app
on your mobile device to keep you safe. It alerts you with a vibration or buzz if potential virus carriers
step too close. The biosensor membranes
on your inner wrist display real time physiological data, including the expiration
of various vaccines -- and yours are three years out of date! Without this electric identification film, you definitely can’t get to the hospital, or anywhere, as it’s needed
to access transportation. Meanwhile, your device streams real-time medical status
of your dying lover, making it hard not to panic. You race against the clock. When you make it in time? Can you even get there? 03:07You can. Thanks to AI-automated processes, it was possible to synthesize
a quick-fix drug for your lover. And technologies such as AlphaFold will accelerate the speed of vaccine
development from years to weeks. 03:24So, what else could happen in 2041? Anti-fake detectors are part
of the standard configuration for cybersecurity. The abuse of technology such as deepfakes to spread rumors and hatred increase conflicts
and tear the society apart, it's a thing of the past. Real personalized learning finally arrives with customized AI companions
that calibrate creativity, communication and compassion
to each individual equally. Educational technology no longer
exacerbates class divisions. With digital twins enabled
by natural language processing and XR technologies, Kobe Bryant, Maradona
and Whitney Houston would be reborn and become immortal virtual characters in your customized
entertainment experience. 04:332041 is just around the corner. Only 20 years away. And most of us watching this talk
will, if lucky enough, be alive to experience it. That's why, together
with the artificial intelligence expert, Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, I chose to write a book
that blends science fiction realism with the analysis, not just of technology, but also the big ideas
that animate technology. When most think of AI in science fiction, it's often dystopian. HAL 9000, Terminator, Ex Machina -- The AI always feels competitive, hostile, the outlook for humanity bleak. But with our book,
we explore a different approach. 05:28We spent almost two years visiting labs and AI scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers and scholars, trying to figure out the most realistic
road map of AI development over the next 20 years. The AI technology
we researched into for the book range from natural-language processing to GPT-3, to augmented
mixed virtual reality, computer vision, GANs,
brain-computer interfaces. We put all this solid know-how into predictions
and futuristic storytellings, set in 10 different cities
all around the world. 06:16It was not easy
to tell stories in that way. But without disregarding
AI's faults and nuances, Kai-Fu and I endeavor to portray a future where AI technology could influence
individuals and societies positively. We wish to represent how individuals
from disparate cultures and industries, with different identities would react
to the future shock induced by AI. 06:49footnotefootnoteLet's get back to 2021, the present. The pandemic still spans the world. The people are still unemployed, isolated from friends, family and nature. Will AI really solve
all these problems? From modern submarine to the laser gun, from mobile phones to CRISPR, many scientists will admit
inspiration from fiction. Imagination does shape the world. So for every future we wish to create, we must first learn to imagine it. By imagining the future
through science fiction, we can even step in, make changes and actively play a role
in shaping our reality. 07:46Thank you."
1,The magic of the Amazon: A river that flows invisibly all around us,Antonio Donato Nobre,Sep 2014,"The Amazon River is like a heart, pumping water from the seas through it, and up into the atmosphere through 600 billion trees, which act like lungs.

For those who watched
Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk, I am a typical example 
of what he describes as ""the body as a form
of transport for the head,"" a university professor. 00:15You might think it was not fair that I've been lined up to speak
after these first two talks to speak about science. I can't move my body to the beat, and after a scientist
who became a philosopher, I have to talk about hard science. It could be a very dry subject. Yet, I feel honored. Never in my career, and it's been a long career, have I had the opportunity to start a talk feeling so inspired, like this one. 00:48Usually, talking about science is like exercising in a dry place. However, I've had the pleasure of being invited to come here
to talk about water. The words ""water"" and ""dry""
do not match, right? It is even better to talk about
water in the Amazon, which is the splendid cradle 
of life. Fresh life. So this is what inspired me. That's why I'm here,
although I'm carrying my head over here. I am trying, or will try to convey
this inspiration. I hope this story will inspire you
and that you'll spread the word. 01:31We know that there is controversy. The Amazon is the ""lung of the world,"" because of its massive power
to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere. We also hear about
the storehouse of biodiversity. While many believe it, few know it. If you go out there, in this marsh, you'll be amazed at the -- You can barely see the animals. The Indians say, ""The forest
has more eyes than leaves."" That is true, and I will try
to show you something. 02:10But today, I'm going to use
a different approach, one that is inspired by these
two initiatives here, a harmonic one and a philosophical one. I'll try to use an approach
that's slightly materialistic, but it also attempts to convey
that, in nature, there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony. There'll be no music in my presentation, but I hope you'll all notice the music
of the reality I'm going to show you. I'm going to talk about physiology —
not about lungs, but other analogies with human physiology, especially the heart. 02:44We'll start by thinking that water is like blood. The circulation in our body
distributes fresh blood, which feeds, nurtures and supports us, and brings the used blood back
to be renewed. In the Amazon, things happen similarly. We'll start by talking about
the power of all these processes. This is an image of rain in motion. What you see there
is the years passing in seconds. Rains all over the world.
What do you see? The equatorial region, in general, and the Amazon specifically, is extremely important
for the world's climate. It's a powerful engine. There is a frantic evaporation
taking place here. 03:44If we take a look at this other image, which shows the water vapor flow, you have dry air in black,
moist air in gray, and clouds in white. What you see there is an extraordinary
resurgence in the Amazon. What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert, what phenomenon makes water
gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power 
that it can be seen from space? What phenomenon is this? It could be a geyser. A geyser is underground water
heated by magma, exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water 
into the atmosphere. There are no geysers in the Amazon,
unless I am wrong. I don't know of any. But we have something
that plays the same role, with much more elegance though: the trees, our good old friends that, like geysers, can transfer an enormous amount of water
from the ground into the atmosphere. 04:47There are 600 billion trees
in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers. That is done with
an extraordinary sophistication. They don't need the heat of magma. They use sunlight to do this process. So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon, a big tree manages
to transfer 1,000 liters of water through its transpiration -- 1,000 liters. If we take all the Amazon, which is a very large area, and add it up to all that water
that is released by transpiration, which is the sweat of the forest, we'll get to an incredible number: 20 billion metric tons of water. In one day. 05:31Do you know how much that is? The Amazon River,
the largest river on Earth, one fifth of all the fresh water that leaves the continents of the
whole world and ends up in the oceans, dumps 17 billion metric tons
of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean. This river of vapor that comes up from the forest
and goes into the atmosphere is greater than the Amazon River. Just to give you an idea. If we could take a gigantic kettle, the kind you could plug into
a power socket, an electric one, and put those 20 billion
metric tons of water in it, how much power would you need
to have this water evaporated? Any idea? A really big kettle. A gigantic kettle, right? 50 thousand Itaipus. Itaipu is still the largest
hydroelectric plant in the world. and Brazil is very proud of it because it provides more 
than 30 percent of the power that is consumed in Brazil. And the Amazon is here,
doing this for free. It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,
providing environmental services. 06:34Related to this subject, we are going to talk about
what I call the paradox of chance, which is curious. If you look at the world map -- it's easy to see this -- you'll see that there are forests
in the equatorial zone, and deserts are organized
at 30 degrees north latitude, 30 degrees south latitude, aligned. Look over there, in the southern
hemisphere, the Atacama; Namibia and Kalahari in Africa;
the Australian desert. In the northern hemisphere,
the Sahara, Sonoran, etc. There is an exception, and it's curious: It's the quadrangle that ranges from
Cuiabá to Buenos Aires, and from São Paulo to the Andes. This quadrangle
was supposed to be a desert. It's on the line of deserts. Why isn't it? That's why
I call it the paradox of chance. What do we have in South America
that is different? 07:24If we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies, like the water
circulating in the landscape, we see that rivers are veins, they drain the landscape,
they drain the tissue of nature. Where are the arteries? Any guess? What takes -- How does water get to irrigate
the tissues of nature and bring everything back through rivers? There is a new type of river, which originates in the blue sea, which flows through the green ocean -- it not only flows, but it is also
pumped by the green ocean -- and then it falls on our land. All our economy, that quadrangle, 70 percent of South America's 
GDP comes from that area. It depends on this river. This river flows invisibly above us. We are floating here
on this floating hotel, on one of the largest rivers on Earth,
the Negro River. It's a bit dry and rough,
but we are floating here, and there is this
invisible river running above us. 08:34This river has a pulse. Here it is, pulsing. That's why we also talk about the heart. You can see the different seasons there. There's the rainy season. In the Amazon,
we used to have two seasons, the humid season
and the even more humid season. Now we have a dry season. You can see the river covering that region which, otherwise, would be a desert.
And it is not. 09:01We, scientists --
You see that I'm struggling here to move my head
from one side to the other. Scientists study how it works, why, etc. and these studies
are generating a series of discoveries, which are absolutely fabulous, to raise our awareness of the wealth, the complexity,
and the wonder that we have, the symphony we have in this process. One of them is: How is rain formed? Above the Amazon, there is clean air, as there is clean air above the ocean. The blue sea has clean air above it
and forms pretty few clouds; there's almost no rain there. The green ocean has the same clean air,
but forms a lot of rain. What is happening here that is different? 09:46The forest emits smells, and these smells are condensation nuclei, which form drops in the atmosphere. Then, clouds are formed
and there is torrential rain. The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden. This relation between a living thing,
which is the forest, and a nonliving thing,
which is the atmosphere, is ingenious in the Amazon, because the forest provides
water and seeds, and the atmosphere forms the rain
and gives water back, guaranteeing the forest's survival. 10:24There are other factors as well. We've talked a little about the heart, and let's now talk about
another function: the liver! When humid air, high humidity
and radiation are combined with these organic compounds, which I call exogenous vitamin C,
generous vitamin C in the form of gas, the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants. You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air
on Earth, here in the Amazon, because the plants take care
of this characteristic as well. This benefits the very way plants work, which is another ingenious cycle. 11:01Speaking of fractals, and their relation with the way we work, we can establish other comparisons. As in the upper airways of our lungs, the air in the Amazon
gets cleaned up from the excess of dust. The dust in the air that we breathe
is cleaned by our airways. This keeps the excess of dust
from affecting the rainfall. When there are fires in the Amazon, the smoke stops the rain, 
it stops raining, the forest dries up and catches fire. There is another fractal analogy. Like in the veins and arteries, the rain water is a feedback. It returns to the atmosphere. Like endocrinal glands and hormones, there are those gases
which I told you about before, that are formed and released
into the atmosphere, like hormones, which help in the formation of rain. Like the liver and the kidneys,
as I've said, cleaning the air. And, finally, like the heart: pumping water from outside, from the sea, into the forest. We call it the biotic moisture pump, a new theory that is explained
in a very simple way. 12:15If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea, evaporation's greater on the sea, and it sucks the air above the desert. The desert is trapped in this condition.
It will always be dry. If you have
the opposite situation, a forest, the evaporation, as we showed,
is much greater, because of the trees, and this relation is reversed. The air above the sea
is sucked into the continent and humidity is imported. This satellite image
was taken one month ago — that's Manaus down there,
we're down there — and it shows this process. It's not a common little river
that flows into a canal. It's a mighty river
that irrigates South America, among other things. This image shows those paths, all the hurricanes
that have been recorded. You can see that, in the red square,
there hardly are any hurricanes. That is no accident. This pump that sucks
the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea, and this prevents hurricane formations. 13:21To close this part and sum up, I'd like to talk about
something a little different. I have several colleagues who worked in the development
of these theories. They think, and so do I, that we can save planet Earth. I'm not talking only about the Amazon. The Amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works. We didn't understand
these processes before because the rest of the world
is messed up. We could understand it here, though. These colleagues propose
that, yes, we can save other areas, including deserts. If we could establish forests
in those other areas, we can reverse climate change, including global warming. 14:10I have a dear colleague in India, whose name is Suprabha Seshan,
and she has a motto. Her motto is,
""Gardening back the biosphere,"" ""Reajardinando a biosfera"" in Portuguese. She does a wonderful job
rebuilding ecosystems. We need to do this. Having closed this quick introduction, we see the reality that we have out here, which is drought, this climate change, things that we already knew. 14:40I'd like to tell you a short story. Once, about four years ago, I attended a declamation,
of a text by Davi Kopenawa, a wise representative
of the Yanomami people, and it went more or less like this: ""Doesn't the white man know that, if he destroys the forest,
there will be no more rain? And that, if there's no more rain, there'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"" I heard that, and my eyes welled up and I went, ""Oh, my! I've been studying this for 20 years,
with a super computer, dozens, thousands of scientists, and we are starting to get to this
conclusion, which he already knows!"" A critical point is the Yanomami
have never deforested. How could they know the rain would end? This bugged me and I was befuddled. How could he know that? 15:35Some months later,
I met him at another event and said, ""Davi, how did you know that if the forest
was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"" He replied:
""The spirit of the forest told us."" For me, this was a game changer, a radical change. I said, ""Gosh! Why am I doing all this science to get to a conclusion
that he already knows?"" Then, something 
absolutely critical hit me, which is, seeing is believing. Out of sight, out of mind. This is a need the previous speaker
pointed out: We need to see things -- I mean, we, Western society, which is becoming global, civilized -- we need to see. If we don't see,
we don't register the information. We live in ignorance. 16:40So, I propose the following -- of course, the astronomer
wouldn't like the idea -- but let's turn the Hubble telescope
upside down. And let's make it look down here, rather than to the far reaches
of the universe. The universe is wonderful, but we have a practical reality, which is we live in an unknown cosmos, and we're ignorant about it. We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us. Talk to any astrophysicist. The Earth is a statistical improbability. The stability and comfort that we enjoy,
despite the droughts of the Negro River, and all the heat and cold
and typhoons, etc., there is nothing like it in the universe,
that we know of. 17:22Then, let's turn Hubble in our direction, and let's look at the Earth. Let's start with the Amazon! Let's dive, let's reach out the reality
we live in every day, and look carefully at it,
since that's what we need. Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this. He has something already
that I think I missed. I was educated by television. I think that I missed this, an ancestral record, a valuation of what I don't know,
what I haven't seen. He is not a doubting Thomas. He believes, 
with veneration and reverence, in what his ancestors
and the spirits taught him. We can't do it,
so let's look into the forest. Even with Hubble up there -- this is a bird's-eye view, right? Even when this happens, we also see something that we don't know. The Spanish called it the green inferno. If you go out there
into the bushes and get lost, and, let's say, if you head west, it's 900 kilometers to Colombia, and another 1,000 to somewhere else. So, you can figure out
why they called it the green inferno. 18:31But go and look at what is in there. It is a live carpet. Each color you see is a tree species. Each tree, each tree top, has up to 10,000 species of insects in it, let alone the millions of species
of fungi, bacteria, etc. All invisible. All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us than the galaxies billions
of light years away from the Earth, which Hubble brings
to our newspapers everyday. 19:00I'm going to end my talk here -- I have a few seconds left -- by showing you this wonderful being. When we see the morpho butterfly
in the forest, we feel like someone's left open
the door to heaven, and this creature escaped from there,
because it's so beautiful. However, I cannot finish without showing you a tech side. We are tech-arrogant. We deprive nature of its technology. A robotic hand is technological, mine is biological, and we don't think about it anymore. 19:31Let's then look at the morpho butterfly, an example of an invisible
technological competence of life, which is at the very heart of our
possibility of surviving on this planet, and let's zoom in on it.
Again, Hubble is there. Let's get into the butterfly's wings. Scholars have tried to explain:
Why is it blue? Let's zoom in on it. What you see is that the architecture
of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world. All of this on a tiny scale. Besides its beauty and functioning,
there is another side to it. In nature, all that is organized in extraordinary
structures has a function. This function of the morpho butterfly —
it is not blue; it does not have blue pigments. It has photonic crystals on its surface,
according to people who studied it, which are extremely 
sophisticated crystals. Our technology had
nothing like that at the time. Hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology, and it is used in optical fibers
to transmit -- Janine Benyus, who's been here several
times, talks about it: biomimetics. My time's up. 20:42Then, I'll wrap it up with
what is at the base of this capacity, of this competence of biodiversity, producing all these wonderful services: the living cell. It is a structure with a few microns,
which is an internal wonder. There are TED Talks about it.
I won't talk much longer, but each person in this room,
including myself, has 100 trillion of these
micromachines in their body, so that we can enjoy well-being. Imagine what is out there
in the Amazon forest: 100 trillion. This is greater
than the number of stars in the sky. And we are not aware of it. 21:19Thank you so much. (Applause)"

Experimental Forest in New Hampshire made a shocking discovery. Their most recent rainfall samples were
nearly 100 times more acidic than usual. At these levels, additional downpours
of acid rain would destroy the region’s 
marine and arboreal ecosystems in a matter of decades. Urgently sharing their findings
with fellow researchers, they were determined 
to answer two questions: what was causing this deadly rainfall?
And what could be done to stop it? 00:43Rain is never just composed of water. Chemicals and particulates in the
atmosphere can be found in every drop, and some compounds— like carbon dioxide— make even regular rainfall 
slightly acidic. But this pales in comparison 
to the powerful acids produced when water interacts with oxides 
of nitrogen or sulfur dioxide. On the pH scale which measures acidity, each whole number is 10 times 
more acidic than the one above it. And where normal rain has a pH 
of roughly 5.4, rain that’s interacted with these gases 
can rank as low as 3.7. Oxides of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide
can appear naturally as a short-lived byproduct of 
volcanic eruptions or lightning strikes. But power plants, refineries, 
and vehicles that use fossil fuels consistently pump large quantities 
into the air. 01:43These dangerous gases travel with the wind spreading hundreds of kilometers
from the pollution’s source. Acting like roaming clouds of destruction, their presence dramatically increases
the acidity of local precipitation, creating acid rain, acid snow, 
and acid fog. These all acidify lakes and streams,
kill crops and forests, and damage soil to inhibit future growth. Over time, acid rain can even corrode
human structures made of stone or metal. 02:17By the 1970s, scientists in North America
and Europe classified acid rain as a major environmental threat. But despite clear evidence tying
the problem to air pollution, companies denied responsibility 
and cast doubt on the research. In the United States, corporations lobbied
against regulating pollution, and convinced politicians 
that such policies would raise energy costs
and threaten jobs. These obstacles led
the government to delay changes, and mandate further research
into the issue. But after a decade of mounting concern,
Congress finally took action. 02:56Since the bulk of sulfur dioxide emissions
came from power plants, the government set a limit
on the total amount of it the electric power sector
could emit each year. Then, they divided the permitted emissions
into a fixed number of “allowances” distributed to each power plant. A plant could then choose to emit as much 
sulfur dioxide as they were allowed, or reduce their emissions and sell their 
unused allowances to other power plants. This system, known as “cap and trade,” offered power plants 
the economic flexibility to keep costs low while strictly limiting pollution. 03:35Many critics called these allowances
licenses to pollute, or said the government 
was selling clean air. But since the cap was set to lower
five years into the program, it forced every utility company to reduce
emissions in the long term. Some plants added desulfurizing
scrubbers to their smokestacks, or switched to low-sulfur coal 
and natural gas. Oxides of nitrogen emissions 
were also reduced with relatively low-cost technologies. These advances allowed
the power sector to grow while the cap kept pollution 
under control. By 1985, Canada and the European Union
adopted their own solutions, and international treaties 
began circulating to reduce air pollution worldwide. 04:23Today, this science-driven economic 
policy has largely eliminated acid rain across the United States and Canada. And while many ecosystems still
need time to recover, scientists have sped up the restoration 
of other areas by reintroducing essential organisms 
killed off by acid rain. Some countries, like Russia, 
India, and China still rely heavily on high-sulfur coal and continue to struggle 
with the environmental consequences. However, acid rain’s relatively quick
journey from major threat to minor issue is rightly celebrated as a victory
for policies that protect the environment. Cap and trade can’t
solve every environmental problem. But by using scientific consensus
to guide policy, adopting efficient technology, and being unafraid to impose 
reasonable costs for pollution, countries can stop a growing storm 
of destruction before it’s too late."
1,Why we should archive everything on the planet,Chris Fisher,Oct 2019,"The climate crisis could destroy our entire cultural and ecological heritage in a matter of decades – how can we document everything before it disappears? Archaeologist Chris Fisher explains how we could scan the surface of the Earth, not just as a record for future generations, but as a tool to fight climate change.", (1.6K),"Transcript (2 Languages)EnglishEspañolSofía García Lienhard, TranslatorZsuzsanna Lőrincz, Reviewer00:11The most astounding place I've ever been is the Mosquitia rainforest in Honduras. I've done archaeological fieldwork
all over the world, so I thought I knew what to expect
venturing into the jungle, but I was wrong - for the first time in my life, 
I might add. (Laughter) First of all, it's freezing. It's 90 degrees, but you're soaking wet
from the humidity, and the canopy of trees is so thick that sunlight never reaches the surface. You can't get dry. Immediately, I knew that I hadn't brought
enough clothing. That first night, I kept feeling things moving
underneath my hammock, unknown creatures brushing and poking 
against the thin nylon fabric. And I could barely sleep 
through all the noise. The jungle is loud. 
It's shockingly loud. It's like being downtown
in a bustling city. As the night wore on, I became increasingly frustrated
with my sleeplessness, knowing I had a full day ahead. When I finally got up at dawn,
 my sense of unseen things
was all too real. There were hoofprints, paw prints, linear snake tracks everywhere. And what's even more shocking, we saw those same animals in the daylight, and they were completely unafraid of us. They had no experience with people. They had no reason to be afraid. As I walked towards the undocumented city, my reason for being there, I realized that this was the only place
that I'd ever been where I didn't see
a single shred of plastic. That's how remote it was. Perhaps it's surprising to learn
that there are still places on our planet that are so untouched by people, but it's true. There are still hundreds of places where people haven't stepped
for centuries, or maybe forever. It's an awesome time 
to be an archaeologist. We have the tools and the technology to understand our planet
like never before. And yet we're running out of time. The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our ecological and cultural patrimony. I feel an urgency to my work
that I didn't feel 20 years ago. How can we document everything
before it's too late? I was trained
as a traditional archaeologist using methodologies 
that have been around since the '50s. That all changed in July of 2009 in Michoacán, Mexico. I was studying the ancient
Purépecha empire, which is a lesser known but equally important
contemporary of the Aztec. Two weeks earlier, my team had documented
an unknown settlement, so we were painstakingly mapping
building foundations by hand - hundreds of them. Basic archaeological protocol
is to find the edge of a settlement so you know 
what you're dealing with. And my graduate students
convinced me to do just that. So I grabbed a couple of CLIF Bars,
some water, a walkie, and I set out alone on foot, expecting to encounter the edge 
in just a few minutes. A few minutes passed,
and then an hour. Finally, I reached
the other side of the malpais. Oh, there were ancient
building foundations all the way across. It's a city? Oh, shit. (Laughter) It's a city. Turns out that this
seemingly small settlement was actually an ancient urban megalopolis, 26 square kilometers in size, with as many building foundations 
as modern-day Manhattan, an archaeological settlement so large that it would take me decades
to survey fully, the entire rest of my career, which was exactly how I didn't want
to spend the entire rest of my career ... (Laughter) sweating, exhausted, placating stressed-out
graduate students ... (Laughter) tossing scraps of PB&amp;J sandwiches to feral dogs, which is pointless, by the way,
 because Mexican dogs
really don't like peanut butter. (Laughter) Just the thought of it bored me to tears. So I returned home to Colorado, and I poked my head 
through a colleague's door. Dude! There's got to be a better way! He asked if I had heard 
of this new technology called LiDAR - Light Detection and Ranging. I looked it up. LiDAR involves shooting 
a dense grid of laser pulses from an airplane to the ground's surface. What you end up with
is a high resolution scan of the earth's surface
and everything on it. It's not an image,
 but instead it's a dense, 
three dimensional plot of points. We had enough money in to scan, so we did just that. The company went to Mexico,
they flew the LiDAR, and they sent back the data. Over the next several months, I learned to practice 
digital deforestation, filtering away trees, brush
and other vegetation to reveal the ancient
cultural landscape below. When I looked at my first visualization, I began to cry, which I know comes
as quite a shock to you given how manly I must seem. (Laughter) In just 45 minutes of flying, the LiDAR had collected 
the same amount of data as what would have taken decades by hand: every house foundation, building, 
road and pyramid, incredible detail, representing the lives 
of thousands of people who lived and loved and died
in these spaces. And what's more, the quality of the data wasn't comparable to traditional
archaeological research. It was much, much better. I knew that this technology would change the entire field
of archaeology in the coming years. And it did. Our work came to the attention
of a group of filmmakers who were searching 
for a legendary lost city in Honduras. They failed in their quest, 
 but they instead 
documented an unknown culture now buried under a pristine 
wilderness rainforest, using LiDAR. I agreed to help interpret their data, which is how I found myself
deep in that Mosquitia jungle, plastic-free and filled
with curious animals. Our goal was to verify that the archaeological features 
we identified in our LiDAR were actually there on the ground,
and they were. Eleven months later, I returned 
with a crack team of archaeologists, sponsored by
the National Geographic Society and the Honduran government. In a month, we excavated over 400 objects from what we now call
the City of the Jaguar. We felt a moral and ethical responsibility
to protect the site as it was, but in the short time that we were there, things inevitably changed. The tiny gravel bar
where we first landed our helicopter was gone. The brush had been cleared away
and the trees were moved to create a large landing zone
for several helicopters at once. Without it, after just one rainy season, the ancient canals 
that we had seen in our LiDAR scan were damaged or destroyed. And the Eden I described
soon had a large clearing, central camp, lights and an outdoor chapel. In other words, 
 despite our best efforts 
to protect the site as it was, things changed. Our initial LiDAR scan 
of this City of the Jaguar is the only record of this place
as it existed just a few years ago. And broadly speaking,
this is a problem for archaeologists. We can't study an area
without changing it somehow, and regardless, the earth is changing. Archaeological sites are destroyed, history is lost. Just this year, we watched in horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral
went up in flames. The iconic spire collapsed,
and the roof was all but destroyed. Miraculously, the art historian Andrew Tallon
and colleagues scanned the cathedral in 2010 using LiDAR. At the time, their goal was to understand
how the building was constructed. Now, their LiDAR scan is the most comprehensive record 
of the cathedral, and it will prove invaluable
in the reconstruction. They couldn't have anticipated the fire
or how their scan would be used, but we are lucky to have it. We take for granted that our cultural
and ecological patrimony will be around forever. It won't. Organizations like SCI-Arc 
and Virtual Wonders are doing incredible work to record
the world's historic monuments, but nothing similar exists
for the earth's landscapes. We've lost 50 percent of our rainforest. We lose 18 million acres
of forest every year. And rising sea levels will make cities,
countries and continents completely unrecognizable. Unless we have a record of these places, no one in the future
will know they existed. If the earth is the Titanic,
we've struck the iceberg, everyone's on deck,
and the orchestra is playing. The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our cultural and ecological patrimony within decades. But sitting on our hands 
and doing nothing is not an option. Shouldn't we save everything
we can on the lifeboats? (Applause) Looking at my scans
from Honduras and Mexico, it's clear that we need
to scan, scan, scan now as much as possible, while we still can. That's what inspired the Earth Archive, an unprecedented scientific effort
to LiDAR-scan the entire planet, starting with areas
that are most threatened. Its purpose is threefold. Number one: create a baseline record
of the earth as it exists today to more effectively mitigate
the climate crisis. To measure change,
you need two sets of data: a before and an after. Right now, we don't have
a high-resolution before-data set for much of the planet, so we can't measure change, and we can't evaluate which of our current efforts
to combat the climate crisis are making a positive impact. Number two: create a virtual planet so that any number of scientists
can study our earth today. Archaeologists like me
can look for undocumented settlements. Ecologists can study tree size,
forest composition and age. Geologists can study hydrology,
faults, disturbance. The possibilities are endless. Number three: preserve a record of the planet
for our grandchildren's grandchildren so they can reconstruct and study
lost cultural patrimony in the future. As science and technology advance,
they'll apply new tools, algorithms, even AI to LiDAR scans done today and ask questions 
that we can't currently conceive of. Like Notre Dame, we can't imagine
how these records will be used, but we know that they'll be
critically important. The Earth Archive is the ultimate gift
to future generations. Because the truth be told, I won't live long enough
to see its full impact and neither will you. That's exactly why it's worth doing. The Earth Archive is a bet
on the future of humanity. It's a bet that together, collectively,
 as people and as scientists, that we'll face the climate crisis, and that we'll choose
to do the right thing, not just for us today, but to honor those who came before us and to pay it forward
to future generations who will carry on our legacy. Thank you. (Applause)"

In this action-oriented talk, Steiner shows how this power is putting our own survival at risk -- and takes us on a global tour of individuals and societies that are choosing to write a new, sustainable and equitable chapter for people and the planet.", (39K),"Transcript (10 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийالعربيةفارسى한국어00:01I work at the United Nations. And for the past couple of years, I have served as the head
of the UN's Development Programme. When I first walked
into the UN headquarters in New York City, many years ago, the first thing I noticed
was a sculpture standing outside under the flags
of the nations of the world. It's called the Knotted Gun. And it still stands there today. To me, that sculpture symbolizes exactly what the UN was created
to do 75 years ago: to build peace out of the ashes of war. War that had been defined
for so much of human history as the struggle of nations against nations or the kind still raging in countries
like Syria and Yemen that the United Nations
works to end every day. That's what I imagined
that knotted gun to represent. But now, another kind of war is brewing. One that increasingly defines
the 21st century where the dominant risk
to our own survival is ourselves. 01:04A few years or even months ago, if I had suggested
that we’re all at war with ourselves, it may have felt strange, especially when, according to so many metrics, humans are on average, healthier, wealthier, and more educated
than at any time in history. We have more knowledge, more science, more choices today than the founders of the United Nations
could have ever imagined. But somewhere along the way, we lost our balance. 01:33In fact, think about this. Scientists are considering whether for the very first time
in human history, instead of the planet shaping humans, humans are knowingly shaping the planet. It's called the Anthropocene and it represents a new geological era. Today, humans literally have the power
to alter the atmosphere and the biosphere in which we live. The power to destroy
and the power to repair. No species has ever had
that kind of power before. With it, we humans have achieved
incredible things together from closing a giant hole
in the ozone layer, to preventing nuclear proliferation, to eradicating smallpox. But we have also taken the Earth
and all the people on it to the brink. 02:22It's not rational nor fair
what we are doing. Today, one third of all the food
produced on the planet goes to waste. While one in 10 people go hungry. Inequality has become extreme. Twenty-six people own the same wealth
as half of humanity, based on recent data. Today, seven million people die
from air pollution each year, while about 7 million trees, the very things that keep our air clean, are cut down every few hours. We spend over 10 times more
on fossil fuel subsidies alone than we do on all the investments
in renewable power, prolonging our carbon habit like a drug running through
the economy’s veins. You don't have to be an economist like me to know that these numbers
just don't add up. That our economic paradigm
is neither sustainable nor equitable. 03:14Climate change, rupturing inequalities, record numbers of people
forced from their homes by conflict and crisis. For all of our power, these are the weapons we have built. Less tangible than a gun, but just as real, just as deadly. Add an epic pandemic and this year,
for the first time in 20 years, global extreme poverty
is projected to rise, and global human development, a measure of the world's education,
health and living standards, is set to decline for the first time since the measure began 30 years ago. 03:52COVID-19 has not changed the future yet, but it has revealed
these deep flaws in our present bringing clarity to the fact that ending this war against
ourselves is not about trade-offs. It's not about choosing
between people or trees, between poverty or progress. It's about choosing
to do things differently. 04:16In the midst of tragedy, the pandemic has also given us
a glimpse of what peace could look like, where we can see the snow cap
of a mountain for the first time, because the smog has cleared. That's what happened in Nairobi,
my home of many years, and one of the cities
where air pollution plummeted as human activity slowed down. Where it takes 10 days and not 10 years for our government
to get support to those in need. That's what happened in Togo, which set up a digital system
in record time to get cash to people unemployed or unable to work
because of COVID-19 lockdowns. The idea of a green economy
that is fair and just, where people and planet live in balance, is not new. But this moment is. 05:04And if I have learned one thing since starting out
as a young economist years ago, whether I was working with Pattan elders to improve the lives
of farmers in Pakistan, or navigating the controversies
of building colossal dams, it's that systems don't change systems; people change systems. And whether you're a prime minister, a paramedic or a protestor on the street, you can choose to change this one. The people who are choosing
to build forward better from COVID-19 build on growing momentum, the momentum of people
coming onto the streets in protest from Beirut to Bogota, Quito to Cairo, or New York to New Delhi against racism and discrimination, climate change, the price of petrol
or the cost of a train ticket, all united in a deep
and rising frustration with this war we have been
waging against ourselves. 06:01This moment builds on the choices
of leaders I met, as I traveled with
the United Nations before lockdown. Leaders who choose
to do things differently. Costa Rica made a choice
to abolish its army and redirect military spending
to education, health and the environment. Today, they pay people
to protect the trees. And as a result, forests have regenerated
and now cover over half of the country. Or consider Denmark. It has chosen to produce
all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050, and has already passed the halfway mark. One of many countries
moving in this direction. Thirty years ago, powering our economy with renewable
energy was science fiction. Ten years ago, it was considered too expensive. Today, renewable energy costs less and creates more jobs than fossil fuels
in many parts of the world, and offers the potential to put power, quite literally, back with the people. 06:59I saw this in Kenya. Two youth football teams
playing their final match in the Mathare settlement at night, who kept the game going, thanks to solar-powered LED lights. I saw this change, these better choices, with His Majesty the king of Bhutan just turned 40 years old, who chooses to measure progress
based on gross national happiness, not gross domestic product. And I saw it on a rooftop in Khartoum with the young people
who led the revolution in Sudan in 2019. Young women and men who came out onto the streets
with everything to lose, who spoke up for political change
with conviction and courage and who ultimately changed
the course of their country. These are the people, the first generation of the Anthropocene
who are writing the next chapter for people and planet
in this unprecedented moment. And with each choice they make, with each choice we all make, the future we want gets closer. 08:05Just like the Knotted Gun, there is another piece of art
at the United Nations that I think about. A poem by a great Persian poet, Saadi. The poem is embroidered on a giant carpet that hangs on the wall
inside the UN building. beneath which diplomats
and staff from all nations work together every day
towards that future we want. Saadi wrote that all
the people on the planet are like different parts of the same body. Different, but united
as if limbs of each other. It was that idea that led
the generation before us to come together in the wake of war to create the United Nations 75 years ago. The idea that though we are different,
we must choose to be united, but now it's our turn. Our challenge is to come together
to preserve our collective self-interest and humanity rather than tearing ourselves asunder. People and planet in balance, building lasting sustainable peace. 09:13Thank you."
1,How to turn climate anxiety into action,Renée Lertzman,Mar 2020,"It's normal to feel anxious or overwhelmed by climate change, says psychologist Renée Lertzman. Can we turn those feelings into something productive? In an affirming talk, Lertzman discusses the emotional effects of climate change and offers insights on how psychology can help us discover both the creativity and resilience needed to act on environmental issues.", (65K),"Transcript (14 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSvenskaTürkçeالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00It's deeply painful to face what's happening
on our planet right now. From forests burning, ocean plastic, species just gone each day, displacement. It's easy to feel totally overwhelmed. Maybe a bit helpless. Powerless. Angry. On fire. Numb. Disconnected. Perhaps all of the above. 00:42These messy and complicated feelings, they make total sense. I wish that someone
had said this to me 30 years ago. I was a college freshman
taking environmental studies, which is basically a semester
of really bad news about all the ways that humans
have profoundly damaged our beautiful earth. And I felt like I had been dropped
into a dark tunnel, given no tools to get out and yet expected to carry on
with my everyday life as if things were normal. But once you're exposed
to that kind of information, things are not normal anymore. And I was anxious, I was terrified, no one was talking about this, and I almost dropped out
of school, for real. 01:42But instead, I signed up
for a field study in California, and we were backpacking together
as a small group for two months, which I know sounds very intense. And it was, but what I found
is that we talked a lot. We talked about how we were feeling about the world, openly and honestly, and no one told me at any point
to be more positive or more hopeful. Not once. And surprisingly,
I found myself feeling better. I actually felt like
I could face these issues that had seemed so insurmountable more head on. And I had this epiphany: What if by understanding ourselves and one another, we could find our way through this crisis in a new and different way? You know, what if psychology actually held a missing key to unlocking action on the greatest challenges
facing our planet right now? 02:45So when I got back from the field study, I focused on clinical psychology, and I researched the relationships between trauma and grief and creativity. And the paradox at the heart of,
I think, all of this is how do we stay present with what's really painful, how do we stay connected in the face of what's threatening
and overwhelming and scary? And it turns out that psychology
knows a lot about these things. Truly, a lot. But I wasn't hearing any of this
being referenced in my environmental studies class, or the climate action meetings
I started going to, or the international conferences, where everyone is asking: Why aren't we acting faster,
and what's it going to take? 03:36And so this has become
my mission of sorts, which is that I take insights
from psychology and I translate them
into resources and tools to support those working on the frontlines
to turn things around. And that means for anyone, by the way. We're all on the frontlines right now. And it's my belief, after years of straddling these worlds between environment and
climate and psychology, that this actually is
a missing ingredient in our work that can exponentially accelerate
our capacities to be creative and resilient and capable
and skillful and courageous and all those things that the world
is needing from us right now. 04:17footnotefootnoteSo I'm going to share
three concepts with you that I found particularly game-changing and how I make sense of this moment for us as humans. And the first is something
called our window of tolerance. So Dr. Dan Siegel has described
us all as having a window. How much stress can we tolerate while staying connected and what clinicians
would call ""integrated."" Integrated, where we can actually be in touch with our thoughts and feelings and not just get kind of co-opted. And we all have a threshold. And what happens when we experience stress beyond what we can tolerate? We tend to go into the edges
of our window. And on one hand, we might go into a sort of collapse, what's called a chaotic response, which looks like depression, despair, kind of a shutting down. And on the other side of this window
is a more rigid response: denial, anger, rigid. 05:23And so when that happens, we actually lose our capacity
to be integrated, resilient, adaptive, all those things that we want to be. And this is totally normal, but it's happening
all around the world right now, right? We're all vacillating between
these different feelings and emotions. 05:41And so with something like climate change, with every new scientific report, documentary, connecting the dots between,
you know, what we're doing and the impact it's having, it can collectively be pushing us
outside of our window of tolerance. And we lose that capacity, right? 06:01So, over the years,
I've interviewed hundreds of people from all backgrounds
and political affiliations, from the Midwest US to China, and I talked to people
about how are we feeling about what's happening. Not what opinions or beliefs. What are we feeling about what's going on
with your local environment, with your water, your soil,
the big picture. And what I hear from people almost across the board, I'm telling you, is a bind. People tell me at some point
in the conversation, ""I care very deeply
about what's happening, I'm incredibly freaked out. I'm scared, I love this land, I love the birds,"" whatever that is, ""But I feel like my actions
are insignificant. And I don't know where to start. And I'm also --"" I hear between the lines
of what people say -- ""I'm really scared to change. Really scared of any change, it's so -- I can't even think about it,
it's like, unthinkable."" 07:01And this is the second concept, which is something called a double bind. And a double bind is when we feel
sort of like, damned if you do, and damned if you don't, and you're just kind of stuck there. It's a very intolerable human experience. And we will do anything we can
to get rid of it and just push it away. And so all that care and concern, it's there, it just goes down,
it goes underground. 07:28But what happens is, it looks like people don't care,
it looks like apathy. And so a lot of folks who are seeing
the urgency of the situation are like, ""We've got to motivate you. We've got to get you psyched."" And we become cheerleaders for solutions. Or like, ""Here's the facts,
this is happening, wake up."" And these things
are actually not inherently bad, because we need solutions
and we need to face the facts. But inadvertently, this can backfire and lead to more numbing and inaction, which is very perplexing
for a lot of people. It's like, what the heck
is going on, right? And so, this is because of this, you know, it's not really touching
what's going on underneath. 08:19So imagine that you go see a therapist, and you've got a double bind. You're feeling really stuck, you know you've got to change and the therapist starts shouting at you and saying, ""Don’t you see
what's happening? If you don't act now, you're going to face
terrifying consequences. Don’t you care? What's wrong with you? What's it going to take?"" Or you see a therapist
and you're feeling actually sad and grief. And this therapist says, ""You know, don't think about it too much. Here's some simple things you can do. Simple positive things."" And sends you on your way. 09:00footnotefootnoteSo if it were me, I would fire this therapist immediately, because a good therapist
practices something called attunement. I love this concept so much. Attunement, right, the word ""to tune."" And attunement is when
we're feeling in sync, when we feel understood and we feel accepted
for exactly where we are. And we feel that, you know, we're in relationship with the world
in a way that makes sense, no one's trying to change us or shame us or judge us. Right? 09:38And attunement takes skill. When the stakes are high, let me tell you, it's very hard
to want to attune with anything, when we're facing such urgent threats. But the paradox of the moment we're in is that when we are more in tune
in our window of tolerance, we are so much more capable
of solving problems, being creative, being adaptive, being flexible, being our brilliant selves, right? 10:10So what if our climate
and environmental work was informed by these concepts, right, of window of tolerance, lot of double binds and attunement? So it can look like a whole lot of things. So I'm asked all the time, ""OK, Renee, this sounds awesome
for a clinical context, we don't have time for this."" And that is absolutely not true. Because we can bring attunement into every aspect
of our work on this issue. And it starts with ourselves. 10:46footnotefootnoteYou actually can't do attunement
unless you're in touch with yourself, I'm sorry to break it to you. There's no way around it. It's from the inside out. And so it starts with actually
tuning in to ""how am I feeling?"" And being compassionate. I know it's easy to say but really being compassionate, it's like, these are hard issues. This is a hard moment to be a human being, we're waking up. I'm not a bad person. What's going on, bring curiosity into our own experience, which then allows us to attune socially, that's the next way we can apply this, is attuning, whether it's in small groups or one-on-one, campaigning, strategy,
classrooms, movie theaters, parks. Where we can give each other permission
to just be who we are, and again, this allows us to move into the higher level functioning. The executive function,
the prefrontal cortex, when we feel that our
nervous system can calm down and we are understood by the other. 11:52And the third way
is leading with attunement. As leaders and influencers, showing up as human, as real, saying, ""You know what? I am really scared. I don't know what all the answers are."" Can you imagine leaders saying that? ""I don't know. But here we are, and we're all needed. And we're in this together. And we can do this."" That's a very different message
than just, ""We can do this,"" right. It's like, ""Here we are. I'm scared, but this is happening."" 12:30So here's the thing, all of this work exists, we have the tools
to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves. And I know, without doubt, 100 percent, that each one of us has the capacity to meet these challenges
with the ingenuity and brilliance and bravery
that we as humans have. We just need to cultivate
the conditions together. We need each other. To support each other and allow ourselves to really meet this. That's what we need, so ... Let's take a deep breath. Have compassion for ourselves and one another in this moment,
time in history, so we collectively process
these painful truths, these difficult realities. Let's do this together. The world is ready for us to do this. And we can do this. 13:38Thank you. 13:40(Applause)"
1,Why wildfires have gotten worse — and what we can do about it,Paul Hessburg,Nov 2017,"Megafires, individual fires that burn more than 100,000 acres, are on the rise in the western United States -- the direct result of unintentional yet massive changes we've brought to the forests through a century of misguided management. What steps can we take to avoid further destruction? Forest ecologist Paul Hessburg confronts some tough truths about wildfires and details how we can help restore the natural balance of the landscape.", (43K),"Transcript (16 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:01As you've probably noticed, in recent years, a lot
of western forests have burned in large and destructive wildfires. If you're like me -- this western landscape
is actually why my family and I live here. And as a scientist and a father, I've become deeply concerned
about what we're leaving behind for our kids, and now my five grandkids. 00:28In the US, an area that's larger
than the state of Oregon has burned in just the last 10 years, and tens of thousands of homes
have been destroyed. Acres burned and homes destroyed
have steadily increased over the last three decades, and individual fires that are bigger
than 100,000 acres -- they're actually on the rise. These are what we call ""megafires."" Megafires are the result of the way
we've managed this western landscape over the last 150 years in a steadily warming climate. Much of the destruction
that we are currently seeing could actually have been avoided. 01:18I've spent my entire career
studying these western landscapes, and the science is pretty clear: if we don't change a few
of our fire-management habits, we're going to lose many more
of our beloved forests. Some won't recover in our lifetime or my kids' lifetime. It's time we confront
some tough truths about wildfires, and come to understand that we need
to learn to better live with them and change how they come to our forests, our homes and our communities. 01:57So why is this happening? Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about today. You see this forest? Isn't it beautiful? Well, the forests that we see today look nothing like the forests
of 100 or 150 years ago. Thankfully, panoramic photos
were taken in the 1930s from thousands of western
mountaintop lookouts, and they show a fair approximation of the forest that we inherited. The best word to describe
these forests of old is ""patchy."" The historical forest landscape
was this constantly evolving patchwork of open and closed
canopy forests of all ages, and there was so much evidence of fire. And most fires were pretty small
by today's standards. And it's important to understand
that this landscape was open, with meadows and open canopy forests, and it was the grasses of the meadows and in the grassy understories
of the open forest that many of the wildfires were carried. 03:19There were other forces at work, too,
shaping this historical patchwork: for example, topography,
whether a place faces north or south or it's on a ridge top
or in a valley bottom; elevation, how far up the mountain it is; and weather, whether a place
gets a lot of snow and rain, sunlight and warmth. These things all worked together to shape the way the forest grew. 03:45And the way the forest grew
shaped the way fire behaved on the landscape. There was crosstalk
between the patterns and the processes. You can see the new dry forest. Trees were open grown
and fairly far apart. Fires were frequent here,
and when they occurred, they weren't that severe, while further up the mountain, in the moist and the cold forests, trees were more densely grown
and fires were less frequent, but when they occurred,
they were quite a bit more severe. These different forest types,
the environments that they grew in and fire severity --
they all worked together to shape this historical patchwork. And there was so much power in this patchwork. It provided a natural mechanism to resist the spread of future fires
across the landscape. Once a patch of forest burned, it helped to prevent the flow
of fire across the landscape. A way to think about it is, the burned patches
helped the rest of the forest to be forest. 04:56Let's add humans to the mix. For 10,000 years, Native Americans
lived on this landscape, and they intentionally burned it -- a lot. They used fire to burn meadows
and to thin certain forests so they could grow more food. They used fire to increase graze for the deer and the elk
and the bison that they hunted. And most importantly, they figured out if they burned in the spring and the fall, they could avoid the out-of-control
fires of summer. 05:29European settlement -- it occurred
much later, in the mid-1800s, and by the 1880s, livestock
grazing was in high gear. I mean, if you think about it,
the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses which had been the conveyer belt
for the historical fires, and this prevented once-frequent fires
from thinning out trees and burning up dead wood. Later came roads and railroads,
and they acted as potent firebreaks, interrupting further the flow of fire
across this landscape. 06:01And then something happened
which caused a sudden pivot in our society. In 1910, we had a huge wildfire. It was the size
of the state of Connecticut. We called it ""the Big Burn."" It stretched from eastern Washington
to western Montana, and it burned, in a few days,
three million acres, devoured several towns,
and it killed 87 people. Most of them were firefighters. 06:33Because of the Big Burn, wildfire
became public enemy number one, and this would shape the way
that we would think about wildfire in our society for the next hundred years. Thereafter, the Forest Service,
just five years young at the time, was tasked with the responsibility
of putting out all wildfires on 193 million acres of public lands, and they took this responsibility very seriously. They developed this unequaled
ability to put fires out, and they put out 95 to 98 percent of all fires every single year in the US. And from this point on,
it was now fire suppression and not wildfires that would become a prime
shaper of our forests. 07:23After World War II, timber harvesting
got going in the west, and the logging removed
the large and the old trees. These were survivors
of centuries of wildfires. And the forest filled in. Thin-barked, fire-sensitive
small trees filled in the gaps, and our forests became dense,
with trees so layered and close together that they were touching each other. 07:51So fires were unintentionally blocked
by roads and railroads, the cattle and sheep ate the grass, then along comes fire suppression
and logging, removing the big trees, and you know what happened? All these factors worked together to allow the forest to fill in, creating what I call
the current epidemic of trees. 08:13(Laughter) 08:16Go figure. 08:17(Laughter) 08:18More trees than the landscape can support. 08:23So when you compare what forests
looked like 100 years ago and today, the change is actually remarkable. Notice how the patchwork has filled in. Dry south slopes -- they're now covered with trees. A patchwork that was once
sculptured by mostly small and sort of medium-sized fires has filled in. Do you see the blanket of trees? After just 150 years, we have a dense carpet of forest. 08:51But there's more. Because trees are growing
so close together, and because tree species,
tree sizes and ages are so similar across large areas, fires not only move easily
from acre to acre, but now, so do diseases
and insect outbreaks, which are killing or reducing the vitality of really large sections of forest now. And after a century without fire, dead branches and downed trees
on the forest floor, they're at powder-keg levels. 09:27What's more, our summers
are getting hotter and they're getting drier and they're getting windier. And the fire season is now
40 to 80 days longer each year. Because of this,
climatologists are predicting that the area burned since 2000 will double or triple in the next three decades. 09:53And we're building houses
in the middle of this. Two recently published studies tell us that more than 60 percent
of all new housing starts are being built in this flammable and dangerous mess. So when we do get a fire, large areas can literally go up in smoke. 10:16How do you feel now about the forest image that I first showed you? It scares the heck out of me. 10:27So what do we do? We need to restore
the power of the patchwork. We need to put the right kind of fire back into the system again. It's how we can resize
the severity of many of our future fires. And the silver lining is
that we have tools and we have know-how to do this. 10:50Let's look at some of the tools. We can use prescribed burning
to intentionally thin out trees and burn up dead fuels. We do this to systematically
reduce them and keep them reduced. And what is that going to do? It's going to create already-burned
patches on the landscape that will resist the flow of future fires. We can combine mechanical thinning
with some of these treatments where it's appropriate to do so, and capture some commercial value and perhaps underwrite
some of these treatments, especially around urban areas. And the best news of all
is that prescribed burning produces so much less smoke than wildfires do. It's not even close. 11:33But there's a hitch: prescribed burning smoke is currently
regulated under air quality rules as an avoidable nuisance. But wildfire smoke? It simply gets a pass. Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs) So you know what happens? We do far too little prescribed burning, and we continually eat smoke
in the summers from megafires. We all need to work together
to get this changed. 12:04And finally, there's managed wildfires. Instead of putting all the fires out, we need to put some of them back to work thinning forests and reducing dead fuels. We can herd them around the landscape when it's appropriate to do so to help restore the power
of the patchwork. 12:26And as you've probably figured out by now, this is actually a social problem. It's got ecological
and climate explanations, but it's a social problem,
and it will take us humans to solve it. Public support for these tools is poor. Prescribed burning and managed wildfires
are not well-supported. We actually all simply want fires
to magically go away and take that pesky smoke
with them, don't we? But there is no future
without lots of fire and lots of smoke. That option is actually not on the table. Until we, the owners of public lands,
make it our high priority to do something about
the current situation, we're going to experience
continued losses to megafires. 13:19So it's up to us. We can spread this message
to our lawmakers, folks who can help us manage our fires and our forests. If we're unsuccessful, where will you go to play when your favorite places
are burned black? Where will you go to breathe deep and slow? 13:52Thank you. 13:53(Applause)"

You've worked very hard. You've knocked on thousands of doors, sweating and shivering,
depending on the season. You've made hundreds, maybe thousands of phone calls
to people you don't even know asking for their support, begging for their money. And now you've got one of these. It's hanging on a door in Washington, DC. It says you're a member of Congress, that you represent
the people of your state. 00:35Now, imagine you're a conservative
member of Congress. For some of you here
in Boston, Massachusetts, that's going to take
a powerful imagination, all right? 00:46(Laughter) 00:47But imagine with me that you're a conservative
member of Congress. You grew up on Milton Friedman. You love his free markets, free enterprise and free trade. You've watched Ronald Reagan's
farewell address over and over, and you cry every time -- 01:08(Laughter) 01:09he gets to the part about
the shining city on the hill, and how if the city had to have walls, the walls had doors -- doors to let in those yearning
to breathe free. You get goosebumps when you think
of him telling Mr. Gorbachev to tear down his wall. 01:31You're a conservative member of Congress, and you agree with President
John F. Kennedy that America is an exceptional place. For inspiration, you go to YouTube and you watch
his speech at Rice University, September of 1962, the ""moon shot"" speech. And you're amazed
that he admits in that speech -- a speech of 17 minutes of pure
American exceptionalism -- that some of the materials
needed for the spacecraft hadn't been invented yet. No matter. We're going to the Moon
before the decade is out. You agree with him that the vows of this nation
can be fulfilled only if we in this nation are first and therefore we intend to be first. You've taken as your own
the affect that he so embodied: that when leaders are optimistic, they're saying they believe
in the people they represent. 02:39You're a conservative member of Congress, and you believe
in the precautionary principle. You believe in data-driven analysis. You know that climate change is real
and human-caused, and you see in climate change a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment. One that calls for
the greatness of your nation as much as the original Sputnik moment. 03:09You are a conservative member of Congress. You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp, and believe with him that the test of conservatism
is that it works for everyone, regardless of skin color. You're appalled by the alt-right. You want them to have nothing to do
with your brand, your party, your legacy. You utterly reject them. You -- 03:39(Applause) 03:44You're a conservative member of Congress. You rise with compassion
to protect the lives of the unborn, but otherwise you think
the bedroom of consenting adults is a rather strange place
for the government to be. 03:57You are a conservative member of Congress. With John Adams, you fear the mob. Because you know, as he knew, that a mob is not able to protect liberty, not even its own. And you're amazed at the wisdom
that he and other framers had in establishing a slow,
deliberative governing process -- an inherently conservative
governing process. It would serve a country. It would grow far greater
than they could ever imagine. 04:33You are a conservative member of Congress. You fear the fire of populist nationalism, because you know
that those who play with fire can't control it. You see their pitchforks and torches, and you know they're not
good building tools. The pitchforks and torches can tear down
and burn up but they can't build up. They can't build up
the institutions and the communities so necessary to a stable
and prosperous country. 05:10You're a conservative member of Congress, and you fear the next
county party convention. You so wish for your party
to be the grand opportunity party, not the grumpy old party. 05:26(Laughter) 05:28You know that they want
to hear from you some old saw about how a secret Muslim, non-American
socialist took over in the White House and destroyed the country, and you know that none of that's true. 05:42(Applause) 05:47You know that they want to hear you say
that you're OK with insults, OK with ""lock her up"" chants and OK with policy pronouncements with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness
that 140 characters can muster. 06:06You are a conservative member of Congress. You realize that many in your party
look to some good old days that you know never existed. They hold on, for example, to the fossils that fueled
the last century of growth, but you know that better, cleaner
more abundant fuels await us, and you know that that abundance
can lead the world to more energy, more mobility and more freedom. 06:39You're a conservative member of Congress. You realize that many in your party
pine for the '50s and the '60s because those were, after all,
the good old days. But you know that the Cuyahoga River
was on fire back then. You know that in Pittsburgh, street lights came on at noon
because of the soot in the air. The schools were segregated, neighborhoods redlined, that communism threatened freedom, and if you got cancer,
you weren't likely to fight for long. 07:13You're a conservative member of Congress and you want to sound like JFK at Rice, where JFK said, ""It's understandable why some would have us stay where we are a little bit longer, to wait and to rest."" But everything within you says with him, this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States
was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. You are ready to lead. You are ready to prove
the power of free enterprise to solve challenges like climate change. You are ready to lead. 08:01So I've got a suggestion for you then: lead ... now. Step out, step up. You know, we ask America's best to die on literal hills in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Is it too much to ask you
to die a figurative death on a political hill in Washington, DC? You know, at the end
of your time in Washington, they're going to take
this plaque off the door. They're going to hand it to you; you're going to go home with it. Can you imagine the emptiness
of knowing that you stood for nothing, that you risk nothing, that all you did was follow fearful people
to where they were already going rather than trying to lead
them to a better place? If you're not willing
to lose your seat in Congress, there's really very little
reason to be there. 09:06(Applause) 09:16So here's the thing: it's not too late. There's still time to lead. Speak out, speak up, call lunacy what it is: lunacy. Tell the American people

Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. 00:26Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. 01:05Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. 01:32Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. 02:03But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. 02:45By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. 03:16Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. 03:41As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. 04:21So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt."
1,Can clouds buy us more time to solve climate change?,Kate Marvel,Jul 2017,"Climate change is real, case closed. But there's still a lot we don't understand about it, and the more we know the better chance we have to slow it down. One still-unknown factor: How might clouds play a part? There's a small hope that they could buy us some time to fix things ... or they could make global warming worse. Climate scientist Kate Marvel takes us through the science of clouds and what it might take for Earth to break its own fever.", (40K),"Transcript (18 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةکورمانجی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I am a climate scientist, and I hate weather. I have spent too much time in California, and I strongly feel that weather
should be optional. 00:12(Laughter) 00:13So I don't want to experience clouds, let alone study them. But clouds seem to follow me
wherever I go. 00:22The thing is, clouds are a real
challenge for climate science. We don't know how they're going to react
as the planet heats up, and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope. Maybe, just maybe, clouds could slow down global warming, and buy us a little bit more time
to get our act together, which would be very convenient right now. I mean, even I could put up
with a few more cloudy days if clouds saved the planet. 00:56footnotefootnoteNow, we are sure about some things. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, we're emitting a lot of it, and the planet is heating up. Case closed. But I still go to work every day. It turns out that there is a lot
that we don't understand about climate change. In particular, we haven't answered what seems to be a very
fundamental question. We know it's going to get hot, but we don't know exactly
how hot it's going to get. Now, this is a really
easy question to answer if one of you would like
to give me a time machine. But I'm going to be honest with you: if I had a time machine, I would not be hanging out
at this particular point in history. So in order to see the future, we have to rely on the output
of computer simulations -- climate models, like this one. 01:51Now, in my line of work, I encounter many very charming
people on the internet who like to tell me
that climate models are all wrong. And I would just like to say: no kidding! Seriously? I get paid to complain
about climate models. But we don't want models to be perfect. We want them to be useful. I mean, think about it: a computer simulation that's able to exactly
reproduce all of reality. That's not a climate model; That's ""The Matrix."" So, models are not crystal balls. They're research tools, and the ways in which they're wrong
can actually teach us a lot. 02:38footnotefootnoteFor example: different climate models
are largely able to capture the warming that we've seen so far. But fast-forward to the end of the century under a business-as-usual scenario, and climate models
don't really agree anymore. Yeah, they're all warming;
that's just basic physics. But some of them project catastrophe -- more than five times the warming
we've seen already. And others are literally more chill. 03:07footnotefootnoteSo why don't climate models agree
on how warm it's going to get? Well, to a large extent, it's because they don't agree
on what clouds will do in the future. And that is because, just like me, computers hate clouds. Computers hate clouds because
they're simultaneously very large and very small. Clouds are formed when microscopic water droplets
or ice crystals coalesce around tiny particles. But at the same time, they cover
two-thirds of the earth's surface. In order to really
accurately model clouds, we'd need to track the behavior
of every water droplet and dust grain in the entire atmosphere, and there's no computer
powerful enough to do that. So instead, we have to make a trade-off: we can zoom in and get the details right, but have no idea
what's going on worldwide; or, we could sacrifice
realism at small scales in order to see the bigger picture. Now, there's no one right answer, no perfect way to do this, and different climate models
make different choices. 04:18Now, it is unfortunate that computers struggle with clouds, because clouds are crucially important in regulating the temperature
of the planet. In fact, if all the clouds went away, we would experience
profound climate changes. But without clouds, would it be warmer or colder? The answer is both. 04:42footnotefootnoteSo I'm going to be honest with you,
I am not a cloud spotter. My favorite type of cloud is none. But even I know that clouds
come in all shapes and sizes. Low, thick clouds like these
are really good at blocking out the sun and ruining your barbecue, and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus largely let that sunlight stream through. Every sunny day is the same, but every cloudy day
is cloudy in its own way. And it's this diversity that can make the global impact of clouds
very hard to understand. So to see this global effect of clouds, it really helps to take a selfie. 05:23footnotefootnoteIt will never cease to blow my mind that we can see our planet
from outer space, but we can't see all of it. Clouds are blocking the view. That's what they do. These low, thick clouds
are extremely effective sunshades. They turn back about 20 percent
of everything the sun sends us. That is a lot of wasted solar power. So, low clouds are powerful sunshades, making the planet cooler. But that's not the only effect of clouds. Our planet has a temperature, and like anything with a temperature, it's giving off heat. We are radiating thermal energy
away into space, and we can see this in the infrared. Once again, clouds are blocking the view. That's because high clouds live
in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, where it's very cold. And this means that they lose
very little heat to space themselves. But at the same time, they block
the heat coming up from the planet below. The earth is trying to cool itself off, and high clouds are getting in the way. The result is a very
powerful greenhouse effect. So, clouds play this very
large and dual role in the climate system. We've got low clouds that act
like a sunshade, cooling the planet, and high clouds which act
like a greenhouse, warming the planet. 06:49Right now, these two effects --
they don't cancel out. That sunshade -- it's a little
bit more powerful. So if we got rid
of all the clouds tomorrow, which, for the record,
I am not advocating, our planet would get warmer. So clearly, all of the clouds
are not going away. But climate change is change. So we can ask: How will global warming change clouds? But remember, clouds are so important in regulating the earth's temperature, and they both warm and cool the planet. So even small changes to cloud cover could have profound consequences. So we might also ask: How will clouds change global warming? 07:35And that is where there might
be space for hope. If global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse
or a more effective sunshade, then that would enhance
the cooling power of clouds. It would act in opposition
to global warming, and that's what's happening
in those climate models that project relatively muted warming. But climate models struggle with clouds, and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways. Clouds could help us out
with global warming. They could also make it worse. 08:14Now, we know that
climate change is happening because we can see it: rising temperatures, melting icecaps,
shifts in rainfall patterns. And you might think that we
could also see it in the clouds. But here's something else unfortunate: clouds are really hard to see. I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest is like, ""I have some
suggestions for you."" 08:38(Laughter) 08:39And you guys, we have tried looking up. 08:42(Laughter) 08:43But in order to do climate science, we need to see all of the clouds,
everywhere, for a very long time. And that's what makes it hard. Now, nothing sees more clouds
than a satellite -- not even a British person. 09:00(Laughter) 09:01footnotefootnoteAnd fortunately, we do have
satellite observations of clouds that, like me, date back to the 1980s. But these satellites
were designed for weather, not climate. They weren't in it for the long haul. So to get that long-term
trend information, we need to do climate science. We have to stitch together
the output of multiple satellites with different viewing angles and orbits and carrying different camera equipment. And as a result, there are gaps in our knowledge. But even from this very cloudy picture, we're starting to get hints
of a possible future. 09:41footnotefootnoteWhen we looked at the observations, one thing jumped out at us: the clouds are moving. As the planet's temperature increases, high clouds rise up. They move to the colder
upper reaches of the atmosphere, and this means that even
as the planet heats up, high clouds don't. They remain at roughly
the same temperature. So they are not losing more heat to space. But at the same time,
they're trapping more heat from the warming planet below. This intensifies the greenhouse effect. High clouds are making
global warming worse. 10:24footnotefootnoteClouds are moving
in other dimensions, too. The atmospheric circulation,
that large-scale motion of air and water in the atmosphere, is changing, and clouds are going with it. On large scales, clouds seem to be moving
from the tropics toward the poles. It's kind of like your
grandparents in reverse. And this matters, because if your job
is to block incoming sunlight, you are going to be much
more effective in the tropics under that intense tropical sun than you are in higher latitudes. So if this keeps up, this will also make global warming worse. And what we have not found, despite years of looking, is any indication of the opposite. There is no observational evidence that clouds will substantially
slow down global warming. The earth is not going
to break its own fever. 11:24Now, there are still uncertainties here. We don't know for sure what the future holds. But we are sending our kids there, and they are never coming back. I want them to be prepared
for what they'll face, and that is why it is so important to keep our earth-observing
satellites up there and to hire diverse and smart
and talented people who do not hate clouds to improve the climate models. 11:57But uncertainty is not ignorance. We don't know everything, but we don't know nothing, and we know what carbon dioxide does. I started my career as an astrophysicist, so you can believe me when I say that this is the greatest
place in the universe. Other planets might have liquid water. On earth, we have whiskey. 12:28(Laughter) 12:30(Applause) 12:35We are so lucky to live here, but let's not push our luck. I don't think that clouds
will save the planet. I think that's probably up to us. 12:48Thank you. 12:49(Applause)"
1,We're covered in germs. Let's design for that.,Jessica Green,Mar 2013,"Our bodies and homes are covered in microbes -- some good for us, some bad for us. As we learn more about the germs and microbes who share our living spaces, TED Fellow Jessica Green asks: Can we design buildings that encourage happy, healthy microbial environments?", (32K),"Transcript (29 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Joseph Geni, TranslatorMorton Bast, Reviewer00:01Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi. Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes. As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems. 00:27Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes, and these creatures define who we are. The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods. The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system. The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch. So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens. 00:56If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways. 01:06I get asked all of the time from people, ""Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"" And I believe the answer is yes. I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously. I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds. 01:35This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building. We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust. From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences. This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project. This is a picture of Tim, who, right when I snapped this picture, reminded me, he said, ""Jessica, the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest, and things have changed dramatically for me."" 02:20So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices, and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk. The way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle. You'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group. So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. 02:54Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. If you look inside the restrooms, they all have really similar ecosystems, and if you were to look inside the classrooms, those also have similar ecosystems. But if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another. I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest. I told Tim, ""If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."" And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. 03:30This perspective is a really powerful one for designers, because you can bring on principles of ecology, and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal, the way organisms move around. We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air. So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system. Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right. They do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology. If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building, you'll see that they're all very similar to one another. And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different. The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. 04:41Another facet of how microbes get around is by people, and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people, or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices. Given that microbes travel around with people, you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes. And that is exactly what we found. If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different. And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital-acquired infections. I believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem. 05:40All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building. I am collaborating with Charlie Brown. He's an architect, and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change. He's dedicated his life to sustainable design. When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did. He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated. 06:24So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building. What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time. Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms. We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation. A lot of buildings are operated this way, probably where you work, and companies do this to save money on their energy bill. What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again. When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers. In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited. He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. 07:44The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything. Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. 07:58There's a new microbe, I just discovered it. It's called BLIS, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath. Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones? 08:14A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible. 08:20Thank you. 08:22(Applause)"

underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon
sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil. This carbon powered
the Industrial Revolution, it put the ""Great"" in Great Britain, and led to Britain's temporary
world domination. And then, in 1918,
coal production in Britain peaked, and has declined ever since. In due course, Britain started using
oil and gas from the North Sea, and in the year 2000, oil and gas production
from the North Sea also peaked, and they're now on the decline. 00:42These observations about the finiteness of easily accessible, local,
secure fossil fuels, is a motivation for saying,
""Well, what's next? What is life after fossil fuels
going to be like? Shouldn't we be thinking hard
about how to get off fossil fuels?"" Another motivation,
of course, is climate change. 01:02And when people talk
about life after fossil fuels and climate change action, I think there's a lot of fluff, a lot of greenwash,
a lot of misleading advertising, and I feel a duty as a physicist to try
to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions
that really make a difference, and to focus on ideas that do add up. 01:25Let me illustrate this with what physicists call
a back-of-envelope calculation. We love back-of-envelope calculations. You ask a question,
write down some numbers, and get an answer. It may not be very accurate,
but it may make you say, ""Hmm."" So here's a question: Imagine if we said, ""Oh yes,
we can get off fossil fuels. We'll use biofuels. Problem solved. Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."" Well, what if we grew
the biofuels for a road on the grass verge
at the edge of the road? How wide would the verge
have to be for that to work out? 02:01OK, so let's put in some numbers. Let's have our cars go
at 60 miles per hour. Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon. That's the European average for new cars. Let's say the productivity
of biofuel plantations is 1,200 liters of biofuel
per hectare per year. That's true of European biofuels. And let's imagine the cars are spaced
80 meters apart from each other, and they're perpetually
going along this road. The length of the road doesn't matter, because the longer the road,
the more biofuel plantation. What do we do with these numbers? Take the first number, divide by the other
three, and get eight kilometers. And that's the answer. That's how wide the plantation
would have to be, given these assumptions. And maybe that makes you say, ""Hmm. Maybe this isn't going
to be quite so easy."" 02:48And it might make you think, perhaps there's an issue to do with areas. And in this talk, I'd like to talk
about land areas, and ask: Is there an issue about areas? The answer is going to be yes,
but it depends which country you are in. 03:03So let's start in the United Kingdom, since that's where we are today. The energy consumption
of the United Kingdom, the total energy consumption --
not just transport, but everything -- I like to quantify it in lightbulbs. It's as if we've all got
125 lightbulbs on all the time, 125 kilowatt-hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the UK. So there's 40 lightbulbs'
worth for transport, 40 lightbulbs' worth for heating, and 40 lightbulbs' worth
for making electricity, and other things are relatively small, compared to those three big fish. It's actually a bigger footprint
if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff
we import into our country as well. And 90 percent of this energy, today,
still comes from fossil fuels, and 10 percent, only, from other,
greener -- possibly greener -- sources, like nuclear power and renewables. 03:56So. That's the UK. The population density of the UK
is 250 people per square kilometer. I'm now going to show you other countries
by these same two measures. On the vertical axis, I'm going
to show you how many lightbulbs -- what our energy consumption per person is. We're at 125 lightbulbs per person, and that little blue dot there
is showing you the land area of the United Kingdom. The population density
is on the horizontal axis, and we're 250 people per square kilometer. Let's add European countries in blue, and you can see there's quite a variety. I should emphasize,
both of these axes are logarithmic; as you go from one gray bar
to the next gray bar, you're going up a factor of 10. Next, let's add Asia in red, the Middle East and North Africa in green, sub-Saharan Africa in blue, black is South America, purple is Central America, and then in pukey-yellow,
we have North America, Australia and New Zealand. You can see the great diversity
of population densities and of per capita consumptions. Countries are different from each other. 05:08Top left, we have Canada and Australia,
with enormous land areas, very high per capita consumption --
200 or 300 lightbulbs per person -- and very low population densities. Top right: Bahrain has
the same energy consumption per person, roughly, as Canada -- over 300 lightbulbs per person, but their population density
is a factor of 300 times greater, 1,000 people per square kilometer. Bottom right: Bangladesh has
the same population density as Bahrain, but consumes 100 times less per person. 05:41Bottom left: well, there's no one. But there used to be
a whole load of people. Here's another message from this diagram. I've added on little blue tails
behind Sudan, Libya, China, India, Bangladesh. That's 15 years of progress. Where were they 15 years ago,
and where are they now? And the message is, most countries are going to the right,
and they're going up. Up and to the right:
bigger population density and higher per capita consumption. So, we may be off in the top
right-hand corner, slightly unusual, the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and a bunch of other
slightly odd countries, but many other countries are coming
up and to the right to join us. So we're a picture, if you like, of what the future energy consumption might be looking
like in other countries, too. 06:28I've also added in this diagram
now some pink lines that go down and to the right. Those are lines of equal
power consumption per unit area, which I measure in watts per square meter. So, for example, the middle line there,
0.1 watts per square meter, is the energy consumption
per unit area of Saudi Arabia, Norway, Mexico in purple,
and Bangladesh 15 years ago. Half of the world's population
lives in countries that are already above that line. The United Kingdom is consuming
1.25 watts per square meter. So is Germany, and Japan
is consuming a bit more. 07:09So, let's now say why this is relevant. Why is it relevant? Well, we can measure
renewables in the same units and other forms of power
production in the same units. Renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off
our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit. So here come some renewables. Energy crops deliver
half a watt per square meter in European climates. What does that mean? You might have anticipated that result, given what I told you about the biofuel
plantation a moment ago. Well, we consume 1.25 watts
per square meter. What this means is, even if you covered the whole
of the United Kingdom with energy crops, you couldn't match
today's energy consumption. Wind power produces a bit more --
2.5 watts per square meter. But that's only twice as big
as 1.25 watts per square meter. So that means if you wanted, literally,
to produce total energy consumption in all forms, on average, from wind farms, you need wind farms
half the area of the UK. I've got data to back up
all these assertions, by the way. 08:15Next, let's look at solar power. Solar panels, when you put them on a roof, deliver about 20 watts
per square meter in England. If you really want to get
a lot from solar panels, you need to adopt the traditional
Bavarian farming method, where you leap off the roof, and coat the countryside
with solar panels, too. Solar parks, because of the gaps
between the panels, deliver less. They deliver about 5 watts
per square meter of land area. And here's a solar park
in Vermont, with real data, delivering 4.2 watts per square meter. Remember where we are,
1.25 watts per square meter, wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five. So whichever of those renewables you pick, the message is, whatever mix
of those renewables you're using, if you want to power the UK on them, you're going to need
to cover something like 20 percent or 25 percent of the country with those renewables. I'm not saying that's a bad idea;
we just need to understand the numbers. I'm absolutely not anti-renewables.
I love renewables. But I'm also pro-arithmetic. 09:18(Laughter) 09:20Concentrating solar power in deserts
delivers larger powers per unit area, because you don't have
the problem of clouds. So, this facility delivers
14 watts per square meter; this one 10 watts per square meter; and this one in Spain,
5 watts per square meter. Being generous
to concentrating solar power, I think it's perfectly credible it could
deliver 20 watts per square meter. So that's nice. Of course, Britain
doesn't have any deserts. Yet. 09:46(Laughter) 09:47So here's a summary so far: All renewables, much
as I love them, are diffuse. They all have a small power per unit area, and we have to live with that fact. And that means, if you do want renewables
to make a substantial difference for a country like the United Kingdom on the scale of today's consumption, you need to be imagining renewable
facilities that are country-sized. Not the entire country, but a fraction of the country,
a substantial fraction. 10:17There are other options
for generating power as well, which don't involve fossil fuels. So there's nuclear power,
and on this ordinance survey map, you can see there's a Sizewell B
inside a blue square kilometer. That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer, which works out to 1,000 watts
per square meter. So by this particular metric, nuclear power isn't
as intrusive as renewables. 10:41Of course, other metrics matter, too, and nuclear power has
all sorts of popularity problems. But the same goes for renewables as well. Here's a photograph of a consultation
exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik
just outside Edinburgh, and you can see the children
of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill. So -- 11:00(Laughter) 11:01People are anti-everything, and we've got to keep
all the options on the table. 11:06What can a country like the UK
do on the supply side? Well, the options are,
I'd say, these three: power renewables, and recognizing that they need
to be close to country-sized; other people's renewables, so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left-hand side
of the diagram and say, ""Uh, we don't want
renewables in our backyard, but, um, please could we put
them in yours instead?"" And that's a serious option. It's a way for the world
to handle this issue. So countries like Australia,
Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan, could be our best friends
for renewable production. And a third option is nuclear power. So that's some supply-side options. 11:47In addition to the supply levers
that we can push -- and remember, we need large amounts, because at the moment, we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels -- in addition to those levers, we could talk about other ways
of solving this issue. Namely, we could reduce demand,
and that means reducing population -- I'm not sure how to do that -- or reducing per capita consumption. 12:09So let's talk about three more big levers that could really help
on the consumption side. First, transport. Here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce
the energy consumption of transport. People often say,
""Technology can answer everything. We can make vehicles
that are 100 times more efficient."" And that's almost true. Let me show you. 12:27The energy consumption
of this typical tank here is 80 kilowatt hours
per hundred person kilometers. That's the average European car. Eighty kilowatt hours. Can we make something 100 times better by applying the physics
principles I just listed? Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's 80 times better
in energy consumption, and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix. 12:49(Laughter) 12:51And there are other options in between, because maybe the lady
in the tank would say, ""No, that's a lifestyle change.
Don't change my lifestyle, please."" We could persuade her to take a train,
still a lot more efficient than a car, but that might be a lifestyle change. Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left. It comfortably accommodates one teenager
and it's shorter than a traffic cone, and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle, as long as you drive it
at 15 miles per hour. In between, perhaps
some more realistic options on the transport lever
are electric vehicles, so electric bikes
and electric cars in the middle, perhaps four times as energy efficient
as the standard petrol-powered tank. 13:28Next, there's the heating lever. Heating is a third of our energy
consumption in Britain, and quite a lot of that
is going into homes and other buildings, doing space heating and water heating. So here's a typical crappy British house. It's my house, with a Ferrari out front. 13:44(Laughter) 13:45What can we do to it? Well, the laws of physics
are written up there, which describe how the power
consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control. The things you can control
are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside. There's this remarkable technology
called a thermostat: you grasp it, rotate it to the left, and your energy consumption
in the home will decrease. I've tried it. It works.
Some people call it a lifestyle change. 14:12(Laughter) 14:13You can also get the fluff men
in to reduce the leakiness of your building -- put fluff
in the walls, fluff in the roof, a new front door, and so forth. The sad truth is,
this will save you money. That's not sad, that's good. But the sad truth is, it'll only get about 25 percent
of the leakiness of your building if you do these things,
which are good ideas. If you really want to get a bit closer
to Swedish building standards with a crappy house like this, you need to be putting
external insulation on the building, as shown by this block of flats in London. You can also deliver heat
more efficiently using heat pumps, which use a smaller bit
of high-grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden
into your house. 14:56The third demand-side option
I want to talk about, the third way to reduce energy
consumption is: read your meters. People talk a lot about smart meters, but you can do it yourself. Use your own eyes and be smart. Read your meter, and if you're anything
like me, it'll change your life. Here's a graph I made. I was writing a book
about sustainable energy, and a friend asked me, ""How much energy do you use at home?"" I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know. And so I started reading
the meter every week. The old meter readings are shown
in the top half of the graph, and then 2007 is shown
in green at the bottom. That was when I was reading
the meter every week. And my life changed, because I started doing experiments
and seeing what made a difference. My gas consumption plummeted, because I started tinkering
with the thermostat and the timing on the heating system, and I knocked more than half
off my gas bills. 15:42There's a similar story
for my electricity consumption, where switching off the DVD
players, the stereos, the computer peripherals
that were on all the time, and just switching them on
when I needed them, knocked another third
off my electricity bills, too. 15:58So we need a plan that adds up. I've described for you six big levers. We need big action, because we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels, and so you need to push hard
on most, if not all, of these levers. Most of these levers
have popularity problems, and if there is a lever
you don't like the use of, well, please do bear in mind
that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers. 16:23So I'm a strong advocate
of having grown-up conversations that are based on numbers and facts. And I want to close with this map
that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just
16 lightbulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. So, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs -- remember, today our total energy
consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth -- if you wanted 16 from wind, this map visualizes a solution for the UK. It's got 160 wind farms,
each 100 square kilometers in size, and that would be a twentyfold increase
over today's amount of wind. 17:03Nuclear power:
to get 16 lightbulbs per person, you'd need two gigawatts
at each of the purple dots on the map. That's a fourfold increase
over today's levels of nuclear power. 17:14Biomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person, you'd need a land area something
like three and a half Wales' worth, either in our country,
or in someone else's country, possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else. 17:26(Laughter) 17:27And a fourth supply-side option: concentrating solar power
in other people's deserts. If you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth, then we're talking
about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right. The total area of those hexagons
is two Greater London's worth of someone else's Sahara, and you'll need power lines
all the way across Spain and France to bring the power
from the Sahara to Surrey. 17:52(Laughter) 17:53We need a plan that adds up. We need to stop shouting
and start talking. And if we can have
a grown-up conversation, make a plan that adds up and get building, maybe this low-carbon revolution
will actually be fun. 18:09Thank you very much for listening. 18:11(Applause)"
1,3 thoughtful ways to conserve water,Lana Mazahreh,Jan 2018,"According to the UN, nearly one in three people worldwide live in a country facing a water crisis, and less than five percent of the world lives in a country that has more water today than it did 20 years ago.

declared Cape Town a local disaster, as it had less than four months
left of usable water. Residents were restricted to 100 liters
of water per person, per day. But what does that really mean? With 100 liters of water per day, you can take a five-minute shower, wash your face twice and probably flush the toilet
about five times. You still didn't brush your teeth, you didn't do laundry, and you definitely
didn't water your plants. You, unfortunately, didn't wash your hands
after those five toilet flushes. And you didn't even take a sip of water. The mayor described this as that it means a new relationship with water. 00:55Today, seven months later, I can share two things
about my second home with you. 00:59First: Cape Town hasn't run out
of water just yet. But as of September 3rd, the hundred-liter limit
dropped to 87 liters. The mayor defined the city's new normal
as one of permanent drought. 01:14Second: what's happening in Cape Town
is pretty much coming to many other cities and countries in the world. According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, excluding countries
that we don't have data for, less than five percent
of the world's population is living in a country that has more water
today than it did 20 years ago. Everyone else is living in a country
that has less water today. And nearly one out of three
are living in a country that is facing a water crisis. 01:47I grew up in Jordan, a water-poor country that has experienced
absolute water scarcity since 1973. And still, in 2017, only 10 countries in the world
have less water than Jordan. So dealing with a lack of water
is quite ingrained in my soul. As soon as I was old enough
to learn how to write my name, I also learned that I need
to conserve water. My parents would constantly remind
my siblings and I to close the tap when we brushed our teeth. We used to fill balloons with flour
instead of water when we played. It's just as much fun, though. 02:25(Laughter) 02:26And a few years ago, when my friends and I were dared
to do the Ice Bucket Challenge, we did that with sand. 02:33(Laughter) 02:35And you might think that,
you know, that's easy, sand is not ice cold. I promise you, sand goes everywhere, and it took ages to get rid of it. 02:45But what perhaps I didn't realize as I played with flour
balloons as a child, and as I poured sand
on my head as an adult, is that some of the techniques
that seem second nature to me and to others who live in dry countries might help us all address
what is fast becoming a global crisis. I wish to share three lessons today, three lessons from water-poor countries and how they survived and even thrived
despite their water crisis. 03:18Lesson one: tell people how much water
they really have. In order to solve a problem, we need to acknowledge that we have one. And when it comes to water, people can easily turn a blind eye, pretending that since water
is coming out of the tap now, everything will be fine forever. But some smart, drought-affected countries have adopted simple, innovative measures to make sure their citizens,
their communities and their companies know just how dry their countries are. 03:50When I was in Cape Town earlier this year, I saw this electronic billboard
on the freeway, indicating how much water
the city had left. This is an idea they may well have
borrowed from Australia when it faced one of the worst droughts
of the country's history from 1997 to 2009. Water levels in Melbourne
dropped to a very low capacity of almost 26 percent. But the city didn't yell at people. It didn't plead with them
not to use water. They used electronic billboards
to flash available levels of water to all citizens across the city. They were honestly telling people
how much water they really have, and letting them take
responsibility for themselves. By the end of the drought,
this created such a sense of urgency as well as a sense of community. Nearly one out of three citizens
in Melbourne had invested in installing rainwater holding tanks
for their own households. Actions that citizens took didn't stop
at installing those tanks. With help from the city, they were able to do something
even more impactful. 04:59Taking me to lesson two: empower people to save water. Melbourne wanted people
to spend less water in their homes. And one way to do that is to spend
less time in the shower. However, interviews revealed
that some people, women in particular, weren't keen on saving water that way. Some of them honestly said, ""The shower is not just to clean up. It's my sanctuary. It's a space I go to relax,
not just clean up."" So the city started offering
water-efficient showerheads for free. And then, now some people complained
that the showerheads looked ugly or didn't suit their bathrooms. So what I like to call
""The Showerhead Team"" developed a small water-flow regulator that can be fitted
into existing showerheads. And although showerhead beauty
doesn't matter much to me, I loved how the team didn't give up and instead came up with
a simple, unique solution to empower people to save water. Within a span of four years, more than 460,000
showerheads were replaced. When the small regulator was introduced, more than 100,000 orders
of that were done. Melbourne succeeded in reducing
the water demands per capita by 50 percent. 06:21In the United Arab Emirates, the second-most water-scarce
country in the world, officials designed what they called
the ""Business Heroes Toolkit"" in 2010. The aim was to motivate
and empower businesses to reduce water and energy consumption. The toolkit practically taught companies how to measure their existing
water-consumption levels and consisted of tips
to help them reduce those levels. And it worked. Hundreds of organizations
downloaded the toolkit. And several of them joined what they called
the ""Corporate Heroes Network,"" where companies can voluntarily
take on a challenge to reduce their water-consumption
levels to preset targets within a period of one year. Companies which completed the challenge
saved on average 35 percent of water. And one company, for example, implemented as many water-saving tips
as they could in their office space. They replaced their toilet-flushing
techniques, taps, showerheads -- you name it. If it saved water, they replaced it, eventually reducing their employees'
water consumption by half. 07:33Empowering individuals and companies
to save water is so critical, yet not sufficient. Countries need to look
beyond the status quo and implement country-level actions to save water. 07:49Taking me to lesson three: look below the surface. Water savings can come
from unexpected places. Singapore is the eighth most
water-scarce country in the world. It depends on imported water
for almost 60 percent of its water needs. It's also a very small island. As such, it needs to make use
of as much space as possible to catch rainfall. So in 2008, they built the Marina Barrage. It's the first-ever urban water reservoir
built in the middle of the city-state. It's the largest
water catchment in the country, almost one-sixth the size of Singapore. What's so amazing about the Marina Barrage is that it has been built to make
the maximum use of its large size and its unexpected yet important location. It brings three valuable
benefits to the country: it has boosted Singapore's water
supply by 10 percent; it protects low areas
around it from floods because of its connection to the sea; and, as you can see, it acts as a beautiful
lifestyle attraction, hosting several events, from art exhibitions to music festivals, attracting joggers, bikers, tourists
all around that area. 09:11Now, not all initiatives
need to be stunning or even visible. My first home, Jordan, realized
that agriculture is consuming the majority of its fresh water. They really wanted to encourage farmers to focus on growing
low water-intensive crops. To achieve that, the local agriculture is increasing
its focus on date palms and grapevines. Those two are much more tolerant
to drought conditions than many other fruits and vegetables, and at the same time, they are considered high-value crops,
both locally and internationally. 09:50Locals in Namibia, one of the most arid countries
in Southern Africa, have been drinking
recycled water since 1968. Now, you may tell me
many countries recycle water. I would say yes. But very few use it for drinking purposes, mostly because people
don't like the thought of water that was in their toilets
going to their taps. But Namibia could not afford
to think that way. They looked below the surface
to save water. They are now a great example of how, when countries purify waste water
to drinking standards, they can ease their water shortages, and in Namibia's case, provide drinking water for more
than 300,000 citizens in its capital city. 10:40As more countries which used
to be more water rich are becoming water scarce, I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel. If we just look at what
water-poor countries have done, the solutions are out there. Now it's really just up to all of us to take action. 11:03Thank you. 11:04(Applause)"
1,Hooked by an octopus,Mike deGruy,Feb 2012,"Underwater filmmaker Mike deGruy has spent decades looking intimately at the ocean. A consummate storyteller, he takes the stage at Mission Blue to share his awe and excitement -- and his fears -- about the blue heart of our planet.", (36K),"Transcript (27 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age. I grew up in Mobile, Alabama -- somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers, forming this beautiful delta. And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes, birds of every flavor. It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in. And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico. 00:30And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six. I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom. And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility. It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand. It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature. Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors. And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it, raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes. I'm going, ""My gosh!"" I had never seen anything like this in my life! So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down. The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing: It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh! -- vanished right before my eyes. 01:23And I knew, right then, at age six, that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did. And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology, and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii. And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium. And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. 01:54Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at, but they didn't really interact with people. But the octopus did. If you walked up to an octopus tank, especially early in the morning before anyone arrived, the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking, ""Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"" And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities: Some of them would hold their ground, others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks, and one in particular, this amazing animal ... I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me, and he had little horns come up above his eyes. So I went right up to the front of the tank -- I was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock, and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass. So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down. He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing. Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm. Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm. And then I realize the octopus won the arms race, because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter) But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing, which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate. 03:34So, about three years into my degree, a funny thing happened on the way to the office, which actually changed the course of my life. A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him, and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras. He said, ""Make a movie about this expedition."" ""OK, a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting,"" and off we went. And we did, we made a movie, which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making, but it was a blast. I had so much fun. And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head, thinking, ""Wait a minute. Maybe I can do this all the time. Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."" So I literally came back from that job, quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing. It's been a good ride. And what I learned in school though was really beneficial. If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals, especially behavior, it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are, how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors. 04:39But where I really learned about octopus was in the field, as a filmmaker making films with them, where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes. I remember I took a trip to Australia, went to an island called One Tree Island. And apparently, evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree, between the time they named it and the time I arrived, because I'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there. Anyway, one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef. In fact, there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly. And there's a beautiful reef, very complex reef, with lots of animals, including a lot of octopus. And not uniquely but certainly, the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage. As a matter of fact, there's one right there. So our first challenge was to find these things, and that was a challenge, indeed. But the idea is, we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them. So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could, every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer. And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up, come back in a few hours. And after the first week, they ignored us. It was like, ""I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."" So they went on about their business and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. 06:10And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember, or at least visually, was a foraging behavior. And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging, but this particular one used vision. And they would see a coral head, maybe 10 feet away, and start moving over toward that coral head. And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be, but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head, and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head, and they would fish out, swim for crabs. And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out. And I always wondered what happened under that web. So we created a way to find out, (Laughter) and I got my first look at that famous beak in action. It was fantastic. 06:58If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals, you might as well pick one that's fairly common. And octopus are, they live in all the oceans. They also live deep. And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep, but whatever the case, I like that. It's like nothing you've ever done. 07:17If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen, and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen, get in a sub. You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen, turn on the scrubber, which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard. Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio. And as you go down, the washing machine at the surface calms down. And it gets quiet. And it starts getting really nice. And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue. And finally, it's a rich lavender, and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black. And now you've entered the realm of the mid-water community. 08:01You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water. Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned, without question, the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community. But we're just going to zip right past this area, this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary. 08:27The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range, 40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe. And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall, some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface, creating islands like Hawaii. And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley. And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range. And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart, magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps, and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes. And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure, forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth, until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals, reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone. In fact, this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings. 09:31And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F. The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing. So it immediately cools, and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved, and it precipitates out, forming black smoke. And it forms these towers, these chimneys that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall. And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life. You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long. And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes. And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals: shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab, clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold. 10:21And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago. And it completely threw science on its head. It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun. And before the discovery of these vents, all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth, was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis. But down there, there is no sun, there is no photosynthesis; it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it, and it's all so ephemeral. You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet. It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment. But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead. There's no hot water. All of the animals are gone, they're dead, and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town, an eerie, spooky ghost town, but essentially devoid of animals, of course. But 10 miles down the ridge... pshhh! There's another volcano going. And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed. And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge. 11:35And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that I've seen in 35 years of traveling around, making films. Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay. And you go back, and I'm at home, and I'm thinking, ""Okay, what can I shoot ... Ah! I know where I can shoot that. There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."" And you show up, and it's dead. There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup. You think, ""Well, what happened?"" And you turn around, and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in, and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth. And over here there's a golf course going in. And this is the tropics. It's raining like crazy here. So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside, carrying with it sediments from the construction site, smothering the coral and killing it. And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals, fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there's your pea soup. 12:39But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite. I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay. And I looked at it, just said, ""Yuck,"" and go and work on the other side of the island. Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful. It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, ""How did that happen?"" Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized. They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered. The ocean has an amazing ability to recover, if we'll just leave it alone. 13:23I think Margaret Mead said it best. She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay. I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations. I've been to a lot of lectures where, at the end of it, inevitably, one of the first questions that comes up is, ""But, but what can I do? I'm an individual. I'm one person. And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."" Fair enough question. 13:56My answer to that is don't look at the big, overwhelming issues of the world. Look in your own backyard. Look in your heart, actually. What do you really care about that isn't right where you live? And fix it. Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same. And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map, little dots on a map. And in fact, the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China, and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ... and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it's not isolated points on a map anymore, it's a network we've created. And maybe these healing zones can start growing, and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen. So that's how I answer that question. Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror. What can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now? And do that, and spread the word. The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live, but up here we can. In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings. And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment, like those people changed the health of that bay. 15:11Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could, everything we could, to set aside not pin pricks, but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation, ""hope spots,"" she calls them. And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that. And it's my hope that some of these ""hope spots"" can be in the deep ocean, an area that has historically been seriously neglected, if not abused. The term ""deep six"" comes to mind: ""If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill, deep six it!"" So, I hope that we can also keep some of these ""hope spots"" in the deep sea. Now, I don't get a wish, but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish. And that I do. 16:06Thank you very much. (Applause)"
1,Fusion is energy's future,Steven Cowley,Dec 2009,"Physicist Steven Cowley is certain that nuclear fusion is the only truly sustainable solution to the fuel crisis. He explains why fusion will work -- and details the projects that he and many others have devoted their lives to, working against the clock to create a new source of energy.", (25K),"Transcript (30 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFilipinoFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00The key question is, ""When are we going to get fusion?"" It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion. We've known about fusion since 1920, when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines. 00:18I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you, but when my mother gave me food, I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first, because the ones you like, you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources, I got very upset, about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life, a strange child. (Laughter) 01:01Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil, gas, sorry. (Laughter) Gas, I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up. 01:28We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World, in the developing world, we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource, it's really from knowledge. If you look 50 years into the future, the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three, with some wind, with some other things, but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. 02:09Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations, and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy. 02:41But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is, the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space, has a virtually inexhaustible supply, is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere, doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste: it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for 50 years. 03:10Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on. (Laughter) I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium-sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split. But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. 03:46And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon, to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen: deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen, which you can get from seawater, and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen. 04:31These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough, something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So, most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium 5, because they've got five particles inside them. 04:55So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5. Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do. 05:22There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom, that's lithium 6, plus a neutron, will give you more helium, plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction, you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen. 05:57Now, why the hell would we bother to do this? This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way, is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate. 06:23And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto, and do all those kind of things. 06:58To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing, on the right, is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost-competitive? We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity. 07:30So, how would we make it? We have to hold something at 150 million degrees. And, in fact, we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape, right in the middle is 150 million degrees. It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road, this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. 07:57When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be, I say, ""Yeah, but we've actually done it."" Right? We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997. And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now. 08:26It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right? You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s. 09:09I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So 2030 looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward, get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
1,Can the ocean run out of oxygen?,Kate Slabosky,Aug 2020,"For most of the year, the Gulf of Mexico is teeming with marine life, from tiny crustaceans to massive whales.

is teeming with marine life, from tiny crustaceans 
to massive baleen whales. But every summer, disaster strikes. Around May, 
animals begin to flee the area. And soon, creatures that can’t swim 
or can’t swim fast enough begin to suffocate and die off
in massive numbers. From late spring to early autumn, thousands of square kilometers 
along the coast become a marine dead zone— unable to support 
most forms of aquatic life. 00:47This strange annual curse isn’t unique; dead zones like this one 
have formed all over the world. But to explore what’s creating 
these lethal conditions, we first need to understand 
how a healthy marine ecosystem functions. 01:05In any body of water that receives 
sufficient sunlight, plant-like organisms such as algae 
and cyanobacteria thrive. Clouds of algae streak the surface 
of deep waters, and in shallower regions, large seaweeds 
and seagrass cover the ground. Not only do these organisms form 
the foundation of local food chains, their photosynthesis provides the oxygen
necessary for aquatic animals to survive. 01:38Besides sunlight and C02, algae growth also depends on nutrients
like phosphorus and nitrogen. While such resources 
are typically in short supply, sometimes the surrounding watershed can 
flood coastal waters with these nutrients. For example, a large rainstorm 
might wash nutrient-rich sediment from a forest into a lake. These additional resources lead 
to a massive increase in algae growth known as eutrophication. But rather than providing 
more food and oxygen, this surge of growth 
has deadly consequences. As more algae grows on the surface, 
it blocks sunlight to the plants below. These light-deprived plants 
die off and decompose in a process which uses up the water’s 
already depleted oxygen supply. Over time, this can reduce 
the oxygen content to less than 2 milligrams 
of oxygen per liter, creating an uninhabitable dead zone. 02:47There are rare bodies of water 
that rely on natural eutrophication. Regions like the Bay of Bengal 
are full of bottom-dwelling marine life that has adapted 
to low-oxygen conditions. But human activity has made eutrophication
a regular and widespread occurrence. Nutrient-rich waste from our sewage 
systems and industrial processes often end up in lakes, estuaries 
and coastal waters. And the Gulf of Mexico is one 
of the largest dumping zones on earth for one particular pollutant: fertilizer. 03:30American agriculture relies 
heavily on nitrogen and phosphate-based fertilizers. 31 states, including America’s 
top agricultural producers, are connected 
to the Mississippi River Basin, and all of their runoff 
drains into the Gulf of Mexico. 03:49Farmers apply most of this fertilizer 
during the spring planting season, so the nutrient flood 
occurs shortly after. In the Gulf, decomposing algae sinks into the band
of cold saltwater near the seafloor. Since these dense lower waters don’t mix
with the warmer freshwater above, it can take four months 
for tropical storms to fully circulate oxygenated water
back into the gulf. 04:20This dead zone currently costs 
U.S. seafood and tourism industries as much as $82 million a year, and that cost will only increase 
as the dead zone gets bigger. On average the gulf dead zone 
is roughly 15,000 square kilometers, but in 2019 it grew 
to over 22,000 square kilometers— approximately the size of New Jersey. 04:50Human activity is similarly responsible 
for growing dead zones around the world. So what can be done? In the short term, countries can set 
tighter regulations on industrial run-off, and ban the dumping of untreated 
sewage into ocean waters. On farms, we can plant buffer zones composed of trees and shrubs 
to absorb runoff. However, long term solutions will require
radical changes to the way we grow food. Farmers are currently incentivized 
to use techniques that reduce the health of the soil and rely heavily 
on nitrogen-rich fertilizers. But there would be less need 
for these chemicals if we restore the soil’s natural nutrients by planting diverse crops that manage
soil erosion and fertility. Hopefully we can make 
these fundamental changes soon. Because if we don’t, the future of our marine ecosystems 
may be dead in the water."

takes its last breath. Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse 
threatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, 
this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. 00:25Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan 
of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture 
is the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide 
and muscle tissue, opening entry points 
for weaker vultures to dig in. 00:46This colossal competition is too dangerous
for the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa 
from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft 
for hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near 
the bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, 
he makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, 
he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open
for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle 
once the larger birds are gone. 01:30High above the commotion 
are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude 
of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher 
than any other animal. At this height, they can’t see 
individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures 
guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature 
as they descend— and keep them clean 
as they tear into the decaying gazelle. 02:00The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat 
infects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t 
stand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest 
gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased 
carrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like 
the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones 
in just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures 
supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume 
diseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them 
from living animals too: their rancid vomit 
scares off most predators. 02:50These stomachs of steel are essential 
to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies 
from the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest 
natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug 
used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs 
prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons
and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline 
in the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, 
poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from 
alerting authorities to their location. One poisoned carcass can kill 
over 500 vultures. 03:45Today, more than 50% of all vulture 
species are endangered. In regions where vultures 
have gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay. These carcasses contaminate 
drinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry 
the diseases into human communities. The Asian and African Vulture Crisis 
has led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly 
20,000 people each year. 04:14Fortunately, some communities have already
realized how important vultures are. Conservationists have successfully banned
drugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working 
to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened 
vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose 
of drug-free livestock. With help, vultures will be able 
to continue their role conserving the health of our planet—
transforming death and decay into life."
1,Community investment is the missing piece of climate action,Dawn Lippert,Dec 2021,There's been explosive investment in new technologies aimed at decarbonizing the planet. But climate investor Dawn Lippert says something key is missing from this strategy: investment in the local people these solutions would affect most. She shares how she's bridging the gap between investment in new tech and local communities -- by getting closer to the places where ideas are being put into action., (48K),"Transcript (4 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربيةFootnotesFootnotes00:00Thirteen years ago, I was living
in Washington, DC. I was working
with the Department of Energy to identify breakthrough technologies
to help solve climate change. And I remember one particular day, sitting in a windowless room, in massive concrete buildings, and talking with colleagues about how this particular wind technology,
or solar, or battery technology could solve climate,
if only we had enough resources. 00:28And then, I met my mentor, Maurice Kaya. And he had a very different perspective. He lived 5,000 miles away, in Hawaii, and he'd been working on the ground, implementing clean energy technology
with communities. He'd been doing it for more than 30 years. And he asked me, ""What if we brought this decision-making
on breakthrough technologies closer to the ground, closer to people who are actually
being affected by new technologies. What would that unlock?
What would that look like?"" And he invited me to move to Hawaii
to figure out just that. 01:02And so I did, I moved to Hawaii. And all of a sudden, it wasn't just my job to identify
interesting new technologies from DC, but to actually wrestle
with some of the challenges on the ground. I was right in the thick of it. This was 2009. Electricity prices in Hawaii
were three times those in other states, and people couldn't afford
to pay their bills. At the same time, solar energy,
electric vehicles, were just starting to come into their own, and it was actually cheaper
to use these than burn oil. 01:35So Hawaii presented
this perfect opportunity to demonstrate how to transition
an entire economy off of fossil fuels. It was all getting real. The battery that we’d written
a check for, in DC, was now on a ship on its way to Hawaii, ready to be installed
just a few miles from my home. And so Maurice and I,
seeing this transition was happening, and the fact that we needed
many new technologies in order to make it work, started a nonprofit called Elemental,
an investment platform. We've now invested in over 100 start-ups, and we've funded more than 70 projects that are first-of-their-kind
technology projects to actually implement these technologies
on the ground, in communities. And we’re testing this thesis: Can we actually make
better investment decisions if we're closer to communities and the places where we're
implementing these new ideas? 02:26And what we've learned
in the last dozen years is that, yes, while technology
brings half the solution, the community brings the other half. But there is a huge gap in the amount
we're investing in the technology to reach this transition and the amount we're investing
in the communities and the community capacity
and infrastructure to actually deploy
these technologies at scale. 02:50footnotefootnoteLast year, globally, about 500 billion dollars was invested in the technology side
of the decarbonization equation. And while this is really
necessary and needed -- and in fact, it needs to increase
four to 10 times in order to get where we need
to go in emissions -- we're not keeping up
on the community side, and the gap is only growing. Last year, nonprofits working
on community-based climate solutions received less than
nine billion dollars in funding. This gap is widening quickly, and it's putting our ability to deploy
new climate solutions at risk. 03:27So let me be more specific. Over the last dozen years, we've tested and experimented with many, many ways to actually try
to rebalance this equation, to bring community investment
more in line with technology investment. You're probably wondering what we actually
mean by community investment. Obviously, [it] looks really different
from investing in a start-up. What I mean is investing time,
political capital and resources in government,
particularly local government, and the ability to permit,
plan for, integrate, work with new climate technology that's coming to all these
local jurisdictions. And on the community side, what I mean is investing in nonprofits, in education, and in hiring locally so that we actually have
the capacity in local places to implement these technologies, and then investing in the bridging
between these different sectors. What we found is that investing
in this more holistic way, on government, communities and technology, not only increases our impact but also leads to better
financial outcomes. The companies that we've worked
with in our portfolio have now raised over five billion dollars
in follow-on funding, and they're operating
in more than 60 countries globally. 04:41footnotefootnoteI'll give you two examples
from the portfolio, one in concrete and one in water. These happen to be the two
most abundantly consumed materials on the entire planet. So first, concrete. In 2018, we invested in a start-up that introduces captured
carbon dioxide into concrete. And the CO2 is then mineralized
in the concrete and stored forever
in our bridges and buildings. But inventing this very cool
new technology alone wouldn't do that much
to solve the climate crisis. Real people have to use it. So in addition to implementing it
with architects and concrete operators in Hawaii, on the ground, and the Department of Transportation,
in a real highway, we brought in local government, to create demand for this new concrete. So with the start-up and our mayor
and our city council, we passed a resolution to prefer
low-carbon concrete in all new projects. 05:37Now you may ask, ""Well, what does this one specific policy
in this specific place have to do with really solving
global climate challenges?"" Well, a few months
after we passed that resolution, our mayor brought this to 200 mayors, who passed the same policy
for cities all over the country. So now -- 05:54(Applause) 05:59So now, this one project, that stores about 700 tonnes
of carbon dioxide in Hawaii, which is about the equivalent of taking
150 cars off the road per year, is scaling to cities around the country,
and also around the world. 06:14But this isn't just about investing
in the local government capacity that can meet technology
and help scale it. It's also about investing in communities. So I'll give you an example from water. Last year, there was a community leader
who started a nonprofit to specifically address water pollution
and pollution on reefs, beaches and Hawaiian fish ponds,
like the one in this picture. They didn't have the technology to figure out how to deal
with the polluted water that was coming off
all of these different buildings. So we scoured the globe and found a start-up that turns
polluted water into clean water and clean electricity, by using methane from the process
and reinjecting the facility. See, like in so many cases, the nonprofit and the start-up
actually have similar goals. The nonprofit, though,
can't really reach its goal of addressing water pollution without technology
to address at the source. And the start-up would have
a much harder time implementing its technology locally without the local relationships
and trust and know-how that the nonprofit brings. 07:20Now I won't pretend
that bridging these two is easy, or that working together is easy. Start-ups and grassroots organizations,
community organizations, they speak very different languages, and a lot of bridging
is required between them. But this is the kind of work
we need to do, if we're going to start
rebalancing the equation between technology investment
and community investment. We, as the investor, often actually pay the nonprofit
to do this kind of work. We think this is a key part
of the equation: paying the nonprofit for their expertise, just as you would pay
an electrical contractor, a general contractor on a project, for their value. 07:59(Applause) 08:06And really importantly, then, building this kind of financial mechanism
into every single project so that, as we’re scaling climate projects
that are working, we're also scaling investment
in the communities at the same time. In our experience, it's been particularly important
in honoring Indigenous communities, bringing them into
the cocreation process early, rather than asking for free advice. Now we, as investors, often pay
the nonprofit partners and ourselves, and we also train start-ups to do this so that, as they become big companies,
as they scale globally, they're doing this
around the world as well. And this isn't happening nearly enough, but it's one tool we can use
to start rebalancing the equation between community
and technology investment. 08:49footnotefootnoteSo these cannot be one-off examples, if we are to meet the challenge
of climate change. Globally, we will need
700,000 electric busses, 25 million solar panels, 400 million vehicle chargers, to meet this challenge. Just imagine all of the decisions
that need to be made, all the physical things that need to be
installed in real places. Global climate progress
relies on local action. 09:18And this truly is
where it gets really hard. It's actually relatively easy to invest
from a windowless room and not really think
about all the consequences of implementation on the ground, as I did when living in DC. It's much harder for us and me
to walk into an unfamiliar situation and acknowledge that we really
don't have all the answers. 09:42I remember early in this work, bringing a new
transportation app to parents who'd said that transportation access
was one of their key challenges. We were in this beautiful space, open-air -- didn't even need
to open the windows, all fresh air. I was demonstrating this new app to them, and saying, ""Do you think
this would help you? What's your feedback?
Do you think you would use this?"" And they looked at me
kind of perplexed, and said, “Well, this is a sort of
an interesting, fancy new app, but we wouldn't use this. What we really want
is our after-school shuttle back, that was cut from the city
budget last year."" And I was turning red, and I could feel the heat
rising in my face. I mean, talk about uncomfortable. But it's conversations like these that have changed completely
the way that we invest in start-ups. Yes, we do technical due diligence
and financial due diligence. But can we be better investors
by actually asking the communities, which we ask every time now,
before making an investment decision, ""Would you use this? Is this something that you actually want?"" 10:40It's what Maurice taught me, early on. You need to get out of the office, get on the ground and listen to what people really need. 10:48Technology can only bring
half the solution. The community brings the other half. And we have to fix this imbalance now if we want to fix climate change, and we do. For any of these new solutions
to work for climate, they have to have
at least these two ingredients: the technology that scales and the relationships
and empathy that we share. This is what we'll need to create
a future where our children can thrive. And I have a particularly large
stake in that. 11:19(Laughter) 11:20Thank you. 11:21(Cheers and applause)"
1,The state of the climate — and what we might do about it,Lord Nicholas Stern,Sep 2014,"How can we begin to address the global, insidious problem of climate change — a problem that's too big for any one country to solve? Economist Nicholas Stern lays out a plan, presented to the UN's Climate Summit in 2014, showing how the world's countries can work together on climate. It's a big vision for cooperation, with a payoff that goes far beyond averting disaster. He asks: How can we use this crisis to spur better lives for all?", (26K),"Transcript (23 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroRomânăSlovenčinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00We are at a remarkable moment in time. We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. 00:16Let me illustrate with an example. I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People's University of China. China was getting serious about market economics and about university education, so they decided to call in the foreign experts. Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle. Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, it was a safe and easy way to get around. Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. When I was there last in the spring, there was an advisory for people of my age — over 65 — to stay indoors and not move much. 01:08How did this come about? It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, from 10 million to 20 million. It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, particularly coal. China burns half the world's coal each year, and that's why, it is a key reason why, it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At the same time, we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. It has become the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. That's really important. But at the same time, the people of China are asking the question: What's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable? They've analyzed, diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. China's planning to scale back coal. It's looking to build its cities in different ways. 02:17Now, the growth of China is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, in the structure of the world economy. Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, the poorer countries of the world, were, notwithstanding being
the vast majority of the people, they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. Now it's more than half; 25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw 25 years ago as developing. That's a remarkable change. It means that most countries around the world, rich or poor, are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. 02:58Now, the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. Fifty percent now in urban areas. That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050. Over the next two decades, we'll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent, and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land, on our water and on our forests. 03:32This is profound structural change. If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way, we will create waste, pollution, congestion, destruction of land and forests. If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers — cities, energy, land — if we manage all that badly, then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. And more than that, the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise, with immense risks to our climate. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. If we go on increasing those concentrations, we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. We've been around as Homo sapiens — that's a rather generous definition, sapiens — for perhaps a quarter of a million
years, a quarter of a million. We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. It would lead to changing deserts, changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes, changing sea levels, hundreds of millions of people, perhaps billions of people who would have to move, and if we've learned anything from history, that means severe and extended conflict. 05:11And we couldn't just turn it off. You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. You're in there. You're stuck. Those are the stakes we're playing for, and that's why we have to make
this second transformation, the climate transformation, and move to a low-carbon economy. Now, the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic, or structural, transformation. But the second of the transformations, the climate transformations, we have to decide to do. Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. Now, the more I've thought about this, the two transformations coming together, the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified: cities, energy and land. And let me start with cities. I've already described the problems of Beijing: pollution, congestion, waste and so on. Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. 06:25Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities, you have to think ahead. The cities that are going to be built — and there are many, and many big ones — we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time 
and we can save energy. The cities that already are 
there, well established, we have to think about renewal
and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities, and make it easier, encourage more people, to live closer to the center. We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non-polluting way in a city: very frequent buses, strongly protected routes, the same service, really, as an underground railway system, but much, much cheaper and can be done much more quickly, a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. 07:27Now, some things in cities do take time. Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. Take my hometown, London. In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people and badly damaged the lives of many, many more. And it happened all the time. For those of you live outside London in the U.K. will remember it used to be called The Smoke. That's the way London was. By regulating coal, within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. I remember the smogs well. When the visibility dropped to [less] than a few meters, they stopped the buses and I had to walk. This was the 1950s. I had to walk home three miles from school. Again, breathing was a hazardous activity. But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. Good decisions can bring good results, striking results, quickly. 08:21We've seen more: In London, we've
introduced the congestion charge, actually quite quickly and effectively, and we've seen great improvements in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system. You can see that the two
transformations I've described, the structural and the climate, come very much together. But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities, and we have to invest wisely, and if we do, we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities, more attractive cities, more productive cities, and stronger community in those cities — public transport, recycling, reusing, all sorts of things that bring communities together. We can do that, but we have to think, we have to invest, we have to plan. 09:06Let me turn to energy. Now, energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent. Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so. We have to invest strongly in energy, we have to use it much more efficiently, and we have to make it clean. We can see how to do that. Take the example of California. It would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent. I don't want to start any — (Laughter) California's a big place. (Laughter) In the next five or six years, they will likely move from around 20 percent in renewables — wind, solar and so on — to over 33 percent, and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to where they were in 1990, a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. That's a striking achievement. It shows what can be done. Not just California — the 
incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India. They've set themselves a target of five years. I think they've got a good chance of doing that. We'll see, but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. Four hundred million, more than the population of the United States. Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. Again, you can see good decisions can bring quick results, and those two transformations,
the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon, are intimately intertwined. Do the first one well, the structural, the second one on the climate becomes much easier. 11:05Look at land, land and particularly forests. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, fundamental to the tackling of climate change. But we're losing our forests. In the last decade, we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal, and much more has been degraded. But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. We can recognize the problem, but we can also understand how to tackle it. In Brazil, the rate of deforestation has been reduced by 70 percent over the last 10 years. How? By involving local communities, investing in their agriculture and their economies, by monitoring more carefully, by enforcing the law more strictly. 12:00And it's not just stopping deforestation. That's of course of first and fundamental importance, but it's also regrading degraded land, regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land. I first went to Ethiopia in 1967. It was desperately poor. In the following years, it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. Over the last few years, actually more than a few, Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. It has ambitions to be a middle-income country 15 years from now and to be carbon neutral. Again, I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. You're seeing that commitment there. You're seeing what can be done. Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. It's working in the rehabilitation of land. In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia, a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards. 13:04So we can see, from Beijing to London, from California to India, from Brazil to Ethiopia, we do understand how to manage those two transformations, the structural and the climate. We do understand how to manage those well. And technology is changing very rapidly. I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this, but you can see the electric cars, you can see the batteries using new materials. You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our
mobile phones when we're away. You can see better insulation. And there's much more coming. 13:45But, and it's a big but, the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should. We're not managing those structural transformations as we can. The depth of understanding of the
immense risks of climate change are not there yet. The depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet. We need political pressure to build. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth, better climate, a better world. We can make, by managing those two transformations well, the next 100 years the best of centuries. If we make a mess of it, we, you and me, if we make a mess of it, if we don't manage those transformations properly, it will be, the next 100 years will be the worst of centuries. That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, and I co-chaired that with him, and we handed that report yesterday here in New York, in the United Nations Building to the Secretary-General of the U.N., Ban Ki-moon. We know that we can do this. 15:14Now, two weeks ago, I became a grandfather for the fourth time. Our daughter — (Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) — Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa. (Applause) Two weeks old. Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues, that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities, and still we failed to act? Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years the best of centuries. 16:12(Applause)"

Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above? That's the one we're not normally offered. What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing? Could we have fuel without fear? Could we reinvent fire? 00:29You see, fire made us human; fossil fuels made us modern. But now we need a new fire that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable. Let's see how. 00:40Four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Those fossil fuels have built our civilization. They've created our wealth. They've enriched the lives of billions. But they also have rising costs to our security, economy, health and environment that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits. 01:10So we need a new fire. And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity, each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air. But they're really quite distinct. 01:25Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil -- although almost half is made from coal. Their uses are quite concentrated. Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation. Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings. And the rest of both runs factories. So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories save oil and coal, and also natural gas that can displace both of them. 01:51But today's energy system is not just inefficient, it is also disconnected, aging, dirty and insecure. So it needs refurbishment. By 2050 though, it could become efficient, connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos, factories and buildings all relying on a modern, secure and resilient electricity system. 02:18We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply. This could cost, by 2050, five trillion dollars less in net present value, that is expressed as a lump sum today, than business as usual -- assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero -- a conservatively low estimate. Yet this cheaper energy system could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal, or for that matter nuclear energy. Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock. 03:16Let me say that again. I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit. In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions -- private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions. And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security, or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health, reinventing fire makes sense and makes money. 03:54General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. So in reinventing fire, we integrated all four sectors that use energy -- transportation, buildings, industry and electricity -- and we integrated four kinds of innovation, not just technology and policy, but also design and business strategy. Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts, especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities. 04:31Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day, plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs, raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP. Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles. So let's start by making autos oil free. Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. And every unit of energy you save at the wheels, by taking out weight or drag, saves seven units in the tank, because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels. 05:05Unfortunately, over the past quarter century, epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have. But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials, like carbon fiber composites, can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them, so their engines get smaller. Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper. So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today, while the driving cost, even from the start, is very much lower. 05:57So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other -- namely ultralight materials, making them into structures and electric propulsion. The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates, that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. 06:32And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers. Of course, computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry, while typewriter makers have vanished. So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years, but then also make electrification affordable, and that displaces the rest of the oil. 07:14America could lead this next automotive revolution. Currently the leader is Germany. Last year, Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon. Also last year, BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car, they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries. And they said, ""We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."" Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year. 07:45Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part, which doubles as a carbon cap. (Laughter) In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium. Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it. 08:15But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos. They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel. If we made all of our autos this way, it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC, by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play. And all those mega-barrels under Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel. They are all-American, carbon-free and inexhaustible. 08:52The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. In the five years ending with 2010, Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds. And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes, now on the drawing board, can save close to a trillion dollars. 09:19Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&amp;D has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries. As we design and build vehicles better, we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving. Instead of just seeing the travel grow, we can use innovative pricing, charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon. 09:54We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be, so they don't need to go somewhere else. And we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing. Together, those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving, saving another 0.4 trillion dollars, plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively. 10:31So 40 years hence, when you add it all up, a far more mobile U.S. economy can use no oil. Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred, adds up to a $4 trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero. 10:50So to get mobility without oil, to phase out the oil, we can get efficient and then switch fuels. Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells, electricity and advanced biofuels. The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels. The trucks could even use natural gas. But no vehicles will need oil. And the most biofuel we might need, just three million barrels a day, can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. 11:32Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call ""institutional acupuncture."" We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly, we stick little needles in it to get it flowing, working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon. 11:45And the long transition is already well under way. In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil, not in supply, but in demand. And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016. 12:01In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices. But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid. Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids, they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power. 12:29So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately. And they also converge the oil story with our second big story, saving electricity and then making it differently. And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector, because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures. Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it. Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper. 13:20But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy, America's electricity use could actually shrink, even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. 13:40Over the next 40 years, buildings, which use three-quarters of the electricity, can triple or quadruple their energy productivity, saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value, with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English, the savings are worth four times what they cost. And industry can accelerate too, doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return. The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. That is, it can give you expanding returns, not diminishing returns. 14:23That is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light, but reflect heat. plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. 15:09But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save. For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. And those can all be made more efficient, and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year. 15:33But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors, move liquid through pipes. But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy, not by getting better pumps, but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes with fat, short, straight pipes. This is not about new technology, it's just rearranging our metal furniture. Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs. 16:07So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors? Well, from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses, only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards, and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls ""global weirding"" back at the power plant. And of course, as you go back upstream, the components get smaller and therefore cheaper. 16:48Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns -- everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries. Typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years, while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost. 17:13Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables. China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. In fact, these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers. Already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams. 18:05Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable, mainly lately in developing countries. In 2010, renewables other than big hydro, particularly wind and solar cells, got 151 billion dollars of private investment, and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year. That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year. In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. In fact in this country, no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital, despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies. 19:08So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants? Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost. But we only need to replace them once. We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on, because they're 24/7, whereas wind and solar power are variable, and hence supposedly unreliable. 19:38Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break. And when a big plant goes down, you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds, often for weeks or months, often without warning. That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. And in exactly the same way, the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations. 20:06Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted, integrated and diversified by both type and location. And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid. That is how, for example, four German states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered. Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered, Denmark 36. And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity. In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050. And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same, about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal, or renewables that are more or less centralized. 21:07But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks, around national security, fuel, water, finance, technology, climate and health. For example, our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack. But that blackout risk disappears, and all of the other risks are best managed, with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect, but can stand alone at need. That is, they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly. 21:53That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending? We want our stuff to work too. At about the same cost as business as usual, this would maximize national security, customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation. 22:14Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector. Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables. And those utilities were rewarded, as they still are in 34 states, for selling you more electricity. However, especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills, the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration, renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. 22:58So our energy future is not fate, but choice, and that choice is very flexible. In 1976, for example, government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down. And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold. Well that's what's actually happened so far. It's fallen by half. But with today's much better technologies, more mature delivery channels and integrative design, we can do far more and even cheaper. 23:28So to solve the energy problem, we just needed to enlarge it. And the results may at first seem incredible, but as Marshall McLuhan said, ""Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."" Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions, both driven by modern efficiency, and you get the really big story: reinventing fire, where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050, saving 5 trillion dollars, growing the economy 2.6-fold, strengthening out national security, oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal, reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent. 24:19Now if you like any of those outcomes, you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. So focusing on outcomes, not motives, can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge. This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy insecurity, energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe. 24:54Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching. Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. Former oil man Maurice Strong said, ""Not all the fossils are in the fuel."" But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us, ""Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because,"" he said,"" they simply won't be around long-term."" 25:26I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity, but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. We humans are inventing a new fire, not dug from below, but flowing from above; not scarce, but bountiful; not local, but everywhere; not transient, but permanent; not costly, but free. And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure, this new fire is flameless. Efficiently used, it really can do our work without working our undoing. 26:11Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize. And our new book ""Reinventing Fire"" describes how you can capture it. So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com, let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you, to help make the world richer, fairer, cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. 26:39Thank you. 26:41(Applause)"
1,Why I protest for climate justice,Jane Fonda,Dec 2019,"At age 81, actor and activist Jane Fonda is putting herself on the line for the planet -- literally. In a video interview with TEDWomen curator Pat Mitchell, Fonda speaks about getting arrested multiple times during Fire Drill Fridays, the weekly climate demonstrations she leads in Washington, DC -- and discusses why civil disobedience is becoming a new normal in the age of climate change.", (57K),"Transcript (16 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeРусскийעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:04Pat Mitchell: It's so great
to see you, my friend. 00:06Jane Fonda: Hi Pat.
It's great to be with you. 00:09PM: Jane, for the ones who may not
have seen the extraordinary coverage around the world of Fire Drill Fridays and the impact that they have already had, talk to us about the origin of this idea, this particular response
to the climate crisis. 00:30JF: I was very inspired by Greta Thunberg,
the Swedish student, and by the young school climate strikers. Greta says we've got to get
out of our comfort zone. We have to behave
like our house is burning, because it is. And so she really struck a chord in me. And then, learning that just about
100 percent of climate scientists agree. They agree that a drastic
emergency is upon us, that it is human-caused. But they said we can do something about it. We have the time, the technology, the tools. We have everything we need
except political will to meet the challenge, and it's an enormous challenge. We have 11 years, many say, a decade, and I thought, ""Oh, I'm so lucky
that I am healthy and living in a decade where we who are alive
can actually make the difference. We can make the difference as to whether there's going
to be a livable future or not. What a glorious responsibility we have. We have to step up to the plate."" 01:52And when you're famous, there's a lot of things that you can do. You have a bigger platform. So I decided that, like Greta, I was going to put my body on the line and move to the center
of American power, Washington, DC, and have a rally every Friday
like the students do. And we work with the students. They speak at my rallies,
and I speak at their rallies. And then after we speak, we engage in civil disobedience
and risk getting arrested. Civil disobedience is a powerful tool that has changed history many times, both in the United States in the '60s
during the civil rights movement, of course in India with Mahatma Gandhi. And I didn't know in the beginning
if it was going to work or not, but it's made me very happy
to see what's happening. 02:48PM: It's also led
to your being arrested -- multiple times, actually, spending at least a night or two
in Washington, DC jails. And while all of us, I think, recognize
the emergency and the actions that you so kindly mentioned
others have taken, I'm not sure that we
would put our bodies at risk, our lives, our careers and our lives on hold, as you have done. Do you have any concerns
about that at this point? 03:26JF: Well, I realize that not everybody
can leave work and go and do what I'm doing. But I must say that
requests are pouring in, not only from around the United States but from other countries, people who want
to start Fire Drill Fridays. And the people who are coming
and getting arrested with me and engaging with civil disobedience, many of them have never done it before, and they find it to be transformative. But the fact is that there are
so many things that people can do, starting with talking about it, expressing how you feel about it
and talking about it, even when it's uncomfortable. At a holiday dinner table and maybe Uncle Bob doesn't agree, but, you know, maybe Uncle Bob
is worried about his grandkids, maybe he loves birds. There's always a way in with people to get them to feel concerned
about the climate crisis. Of course, voting is very, very important, and we have to vote for the people
that are the bravest, the boldest of our elected officials, because the task ahead of us -- all over the world, but certainly
here in the United States -- we have to get rid
of this current administration, and we have to elect people
that are really brave, that will step up -- 04:52(Applause) 04:53and do the bold actions that are needed,
the way Franklin Delano Roosevelt did during the 1930s,
during the Great Depression, when he really changed
a great deal about American society. And that's what is needed now. 05:09PM: So Jane, we should also explain, because many people who are here
are thinking, what can they do? Can they come to Washington
and join you in this action? We should explain, not everyone
who participates in Fire Drill Fridays is under threat of being arrested. There are other parts
of what you're doing, like you are currently
in the Greenpeace offices in Washington. So explain what else
is a part of Fire Drill Fridays and how we could participate
in civil disobedience without the risk of getting arrested. 05:43JF: First of all, you want to try
not do anything as a lone individual. You know, it's by our powers combined. There's strength in numbers. There's also community in numbers, and one of the hardest things
about what we're facing now is: this is a collective crisis, coming at a time when
the whole notion of the collective, of the commons, of the public sphere, is being eroded quite deliberately
by neoliberalism and conservatism. And so reconnecting with groups of people, like-minded people in a common action, is solace to the soul. It gives you such strength.
It's a great antidote to depression. So find out what organizations that are concerned about
the climate crisis are in your area. Of course, Greenpeace has chapters
all around the world. And even if you just start yourself,
have house parties, invite people over
to talk about what's happening. Find an article that you can all read
and discuss together. Obviously, if there's
a climate action where you live, try to join it. It's not necessary
to engage in civil disobedience and risk getting arrested, but it is going to become
the new normal, I think. It feels like it is here in DC
with Fire Drill Fridays. People seem to want
to come back and do it again. My grandkids just
got arrested last weekend. It was a transformative experience. 07:13(Laughter) 07:15My fellow actor Sam Waterston,
who is a self-described centrist, he had never spoken at a rally
or risked getting arrested, and he was arrested with me. Last week, I see that he was arrested
at the Harvard-Yale game. He sent me a picture
of himself in handcuffs, saying, ""Now look what you started!"" 07:35(Laughter) 07:36You know, we're at a point,
I think, in this crisis where people are looking
to take the next step. They want to put their bodies on the line, as Greta Thunberg has exhorted us to do. And they find it very rewarding, and they want to do it again. So I think that this is good,
what we're doing. I met with the Senate [Climate Change
Task Force] a few weeks ago, and I asked the senators, ""Is there something else
we should be doing? Should we be doing more?"" And Senator Ed Markey said to me, ""You're building an army.
That's what we need. Make it bigger. We need pressure from the outside."" And I think that's true
all over the world. People need to be amassing
armies for the climate, armies for the environment, in the streets, shutting down governments if necessary. I'm thinking of Brazil right now. You know, we can't allow
the burning of our precious rainforests. 08:40PM: And as you have done
so many times in the past, Jane, you are leading these changes. Eventually, one assumes, especially
the fans of ""Grace and Frankie,"" that you will go back to your life and resume that program. But will Fire Drill Fridays continue? 09:02JF: Well, there's been
such an interest in it, as I said, from all around the country, people asking if they can start one. And, you know, I have
a lot of celebrity friends who haven't, for scheduling reasons,
been able to come to DC, so we're thinking about
maybe doing it in Los Angeles. But I just want to correct one thing: I'm not leading. It's the young people,
it's the students that are leading. It's always the young people
that step up with the courage, and it's pretty amazing,
because they're risking a lot. It's pretty brave to take
a Friday off from school. You could get bad grades.
You could make your teachers mad. But they're doing it anyway. There have been millions of them
at a time, all around the world. And they're saying, ""Don't let us have to deal
with this by ourselves. We didn't create this problem.
Come and help us."" So, Grandmas unite! 09:56(Laughter) 09:58(Applause) 10:04PM: And you are in a city
that is probably more divided than it has been in a very long time. The polarities that exist there and in many other places around the world have kept our collective strength
from being unified and used, and in that way, you have been leading us. What would success look like to you
from Fire Drill Fridays? 10:32JF: Well, I can just speak
as a citizen of the United States. Success would look like every state stops
all new fossil fuel expansion, because if they keep drilling
and fracking and mining, the problem will just get worse, so that no matter what
we do with windmills and solar collectors and so forth, we'll never be able to catch up. We have to stop all new expansion. The other thing is, they would phase out
fossil fuel emissions gradually, making sure that the workers
who would be impacted would be retrained at union wages and get good new union jobs. There are going to be so many good jobs
with the Green New Deal, building windmills and solar collectors, retrofitting all the houses
in this country, for example, laying a new energy grid. There's tens of millions of jobs
waiting to be unleashed, and that's the other thing
that has gotten me mobilized. 11:32A Green New Deal is a framework
for how to take ourselves into the future in a way that's sustainable and equitable. So that just gives you such hope, because if we do it right,
it's going to be a win-win for everyone. And that has to be the case,
or it won't work, because to make this work,
everybody's going to have to be involved. And in order for everybody to be involved, they have to see something
in it for themselves, and that's what a Green New Deal does. 12:01PM: Jane, you, as always -- 12:03(Applause) 12:07as you have done
so many times in your life, you have taken risk, and you have stepped up
to the front lines. Do you leave this experience
with any new learning or a new level of commitment,
hope or optimism? 12:25JF: Yeah, I am optimistic. People in this country are really scared
about the climate crisis, and they want to do something,
but nobody has asked them. We just have to ask them. We have to get organized, you know? And we can do that. So I feel very hopeful. I must say that I am going to go
back to work on ""Grace and Frankie,"" but part of my heart
is going to be with Fire Drill Fridays, and I hope I can continue with that. I just think that we do
have to build an army. This coming year is the critical year. What happens is going to be so important. So we have to be sure, especially someone who's healthy, who feels relatively young, who has a platform -- we have to use it
in every possible way we can. And if I didn't have that, then I would find other little ways
that I could do it: talk to my neighbors, talk to my friends, talk to my family, join an organization. That's how, also, as I've said,
to stave off depression, is to do something active. 13:32PM: Jane, at 81, you are modeling
what that can be like for sure, and I think we just recruited a new army. 13:40(Applause) 13:49Thank you very much, my friend. Stay safe. Thank you for all that you have done
for the planet and so much else. 13:56JF: Thank you, Pat. 13:58PM: Join me in thanking Jane. 14:00(Applause)"

we're all interested in: Does extinction have to be forever? 00:06I'm focused on two projects
I want to tell you about. One is the Thylacine Project. The other one is the Lazarus Project, and that's focused
on the gastric-brooding frog. And it would be a fair question to ask, why have we focused on these two animals? Well, point number one, each of them
represents a unique family of its own. We've lost a whole family. That's a big chunk
of the global genome gone. I'd like it back. The second reason
is that we killed these things. In the case of the thylacine, regrettably,
we shot every one that we saw. We slaughtered them. In the case of the gastric-brooding frog,
we may have ""fungicided"" it to death. There's a dreadful fungus
that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus, and it's nailing frogs all over the world. We think that's probably
what got this frog, and humans are spreading this fungus. 00:58And this introduces
a very important ethical point, and I think you will have heard
this many times when this topic comes up. What I think is important is that, if it's clear
that we exterminated these species, then I think we not only
have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it, but I think we've got a moral imperative
to try to do something, if we can. 01:20OK. Let me talk to you
about the Lazarus Project. It's a frog. And you think, frog. Yeah, but this was not just any frog. Unlike a normal frog,
which lays its eggs in the water and goes away
and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach,
where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs,
and turned its stomach into a uterus. In the stomach, the eggs
went on to develop into tadpoles, and in the stomach, the tadpoles
went on to develop into frogs, and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog
was at risk of bursting apart. It has a little cough and a hiccup,
and out comes sprays of little frogs. 02:04Now, when biologists saw this,
they were agog. They thought, this is incredible. No animal, let alone a frog,
has been known to do this, to change one organ
in the body into another. And you can imagine the medical world
went nuts over this as well. If we could understand how that frog is managing
the way its tummy works, is there information here
that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves? Now, I'm not suggesting we want
to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage
gastric secretion in the gut. And just as everybody
got excited about it, bang! It was extinct. 02:42I called up my friend, Professor Mike Tyler
in the University of Adelaide. He was the last person who had this frog,
a colony of these things, in his lab. And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --""
This was 30 or 40 years ago. ""By any chance had you kept
any frozen tissue of this frog?"" And he thought about it, and he went to his deep freezer,
minus 20 degrees centigrade, and he poured through
everything in the freezer, and there in the bottom was a jar
and it contained tissues of these frogs. 03:08This was very exciting, but there was no reason
why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue
had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it
when it was frozen. And normally, when water freezes,
as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell. If you freeze tissues, the water expands,
damages or bursts the cell walls. Well, we looked at the tissue
under the microscope. It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact. So we thought, let's give it a go. 03:37What we did is something called
somatic cell nuclear transplantation. We took the eggs
of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg. We used ultraviolet radiation to do that. And then we took the dead nucleus
from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei
into that egg. Now, by rights, this is
kind of like a cloning project, like what produced Dolly, but it's actually very different, because Dolly was live sheep
into live sheep cells. That was a miracle, but it was workable. What we're trying to do is take
a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different
species and expect that to work. Well, we had no real reason
to expect it would, and we tried hundreds
and hundreds of these. And just last February,
the last time we did these trials, 04:25I saw a miracle starting to happen. What we found was
most of these eggs didn't work, but then suddenly,
one of them began to divide. That was so exciting. And then the egg divided again.
And then again. And pretty soon,
we had early-stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those. We even DNA-tested some of these cells, and the DNA of the extinct frog
is in those cells. So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog. But it's a long way along the journey to producing, or bringing back,
an extinct species. And this is news. We haven't announced this publicly before. We're excited. We've got to get past this point. We now want this ball of cells
to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce
the other tissues. It'll go on and produce
a tadpole and then a frog. Watch this space. I think we're going to have
this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again. 05:22(Applause) 05:24Thank you. 05:25(Applause) 05:27We haven't done it yet,
but keep the applause ready. 05:31The second project I want to talk
to you about is the Thylacine Project. The thylacine looks a bit,
to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger,
because it has stripes. But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial. It raised its young in a pouch,
like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history,
a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years. But it's also a tragic history. 05:58The first one that we see occurs
in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago, and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore
these fossil deposits. This is Riversleigh. In those fossil rocks
are some amazing animals. We found marsupial lions. We found carnivorous kangaroos. It's not what you usually
think about as a kangaroo, but these are meat-eating kangaroos. We found the biggest bird in the world, bigger than that thing
that was in Madagascar, and it too was a flesh eater. It was a giant, weird duck. 06:31And crocodiles were not behaving
at that time either. You think of crocodiles
as doing their ugly thing, sitting in a pool of water. These crocodiles
were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees
and jumping on prey on the ground. We had, in Australia, drop crocs.
They really do exist. 06:49(Laughter) 06:50But what they were dropping on
was not only other weird animals but also thylacines. There were five different kinds
of thylacines in those ancient forests, and they ranged from great big ones
to middle-sized ones to one that was
about the size of a chihuahua. Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around
in a little handbag, until a drop croc landed on her. 07:13At any rate, it was a fascinating place, but unfortunately,
Australia didn't stay this way. Climate change has affected the world
for a long period of time, and gradually, the forests disappeared,
the country began to dry out, and the number of kinds
of thylacines began to decline, until by five million years ago, only one left. By 10,000 years ago,
they had disappeared from New Guinea, and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago,
somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes --
this is a very archaic kind of a dog -- into Australia. 07:47And as you can see, dingoes are very similar
in their body form to thylacines. That similarity meant
they probably competed. They were eating the same kinds of foods. It's even possible that aborigines were
keeping some of these dingoes as pets, and therefore they may have had
an advantage in the battle for survival. All we know is, soon after
the dingoes were brought in, thylacines were extinct
in the Australian mainland, and after that they only
survived in Tasmania. 08:13Then, unfortunately, the next sad part of the thylacine story
is that Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them
the things they valued, and that included sheep. They took one look
at the thylacine in Tasmania, and they thought, hang on,
this is not going to work. That guy is going to eat all our sheep. That was not what happened, actually. Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep,
but the thylacine got a bad rap. But immediately, the government said,
that's it, let's get rid of them, and they paid people
to slaughter every one that they saw. By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines
had been murdered. It was a disaster,
and they were about to hit the wall. 08:57Have a look at this bit of film footage. It makes me very sad because,
while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think
that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off
that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately,
at this same time, have a molecule of concern
about the welfare for this species. These are photos of the last
surviving thylacine, Benjamin, who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. To add insult to injury, having swept this species
nearly off the table, this animal, when it died of neglect -- The keepers didn't let it
into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart. It died of exposure, and in the morning,
when they found the body of Benjamin, they still cared so little for this animal
that they threw the body in the dump. 09:48Does it have to stay this way? In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum. I was fascinated by thylacines. I've always been obsessed
with these animals. And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships
to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar,
was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old. The guy who had found it
and killed the mother had pickled the pup,
and they pickled it in alcohol. I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew
alcohol was a DNA preservative. 10:20But this was 1990,
and I asked my geneticist friends, couldn't we think
about going into this pup and extracting DNA, if it's there, and then somewhere
down the line in the future, we'll use this DNA
to bring the thylacine back? The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly. Cloning was science fiction. It had not happened. But then suddenly cloning did happen. And I thought, when I became
director of the Australian Museum, I'm going to give this a go. 10:48I put a team together. We went into that pup
to see what was in it, and we did find thylacine DNA. It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited. Unfortunately, we also found
a lot of human DNA. Every old curator
who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen, put their hand in the jar,
pulled it out and thought, ""Wow, look at that,""
plop, dropped it back in the jar, contaminating this specimen. And that was a worry. If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track
to try to bring a thylacine back, what we didn't want happening when the information
was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around
and the lights flashed, was to have a wizened old horrible curator
pop out the other end of the machine. It would've kept the curator very happy,
but it wasn't going to keep us happy. 11:34So we went back to these specimens
and we started digging around, and particularly,
we looked into the teeth of skulls, hard parts where humans
had not been able to get their fingers, and we found much better quality DNA. We found nuclear mitochondrial genes. It's there. So we got it. 11:49OK. What could we do with this stuff? Well, George Church,
in his book, ""Regenesis,"" has mentioned many of the techniques
that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA. We would hope that we'll be able
to get that DNA back into a viable form, and then, much like we've done
with the Lazarus Project, get that stuff into an egg
of a host species. It has to be a different species.
What could it be? Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil? They're related, distantly, to thylacines. And then the Tasmanian devil is going
to pop a thylacine out the south end. 12:21Critics of this project say, hang on. Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?
That's going to hurt. No, it's not. These are marsupials. They give birth to babies
that are the size of a jelly bean. That Tasmanian devil's
not even going to know it gave birth. It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest
Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help
to keep it going. 12:46Andrew Pask and his colleagues
have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time. And it's sort of in the future,
we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing
we want to think about. They took some of this same
pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything
that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby. In other words, if thylacine tissues
were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized. When the baby popped up,
it was filled with blue-green tissues. And that tells us if we can get
that genome back together, get it into a live cell, it's going to produce thylacine stuff. 13:27Is this a risk? You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell
of a different kind of an animal. Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera? And the answer is no. If the only nuclear DNA that goes
into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out
the other end of the devil. 13:48OK, if we can do this,
could we put it back? This is a key question for everybody. Does it have to stay in a laboratory,
or could we put it back where it belongs? Could we put it back in the throne
of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem? Or has Tasmania changed so much
that that's no longer possible? I've been to Tasmania. I've been to many of the areas
where the thylacines were common. I've even spoken to people,
like Peter Carter here, who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old, but in 1926, this man
and his father and his brother caught thylacines. They trapped them. And when I spoke to this man,
I was looking in his eyes and thinking, ""Behind those eyes is a brain that has
memories of what thylacines feel like, what they smelled like,
what they sounded like."" He led them around on a rope. He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg
to have in my head. We'd all love to have
this sort of thing happen. Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance, could he take us back
to where he caught those thylacines. My interest was in whether
the environment had changed. He thought hard. It was nearly 80 years
before this that he'd been at this hut. 14:57At any rate, he led us
down this bush track, and there, right where he remembered, was the hut, and tears came into his eyes. He looked at the hut. We went inside. There were the wooden boards
on the sides of the hut where he and his father
and his brother had slept at night. And he told me, as it all
was flooding back in memories. He said, ""I remember
the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside,"" and he said they made sounds
like ""Yip! Yip! Yip!"" All of these are parts of his life
and what he remembers. And the key question for me
was to ask Peter, has it changed? And he said no. The southern beech forests
surrounded his hut just like it was
when he was there in 1926. The grasslands were sweeping away. That's classic thylacine habitat. And the animals in those areas
were the same that were there when the thylacine was around. So could we put it back? Yes. 15:46Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question. Sometimes you might
be able to put it back, but is that the safest way
to make sure it never goes extinct again? And I don't think so. I think gradually, as we see species
all around the world, it's kind of a mantra that wildlife
is increasingly not safe in the wild. We'd love to think it is,
but we know it isn't. We need other parallel
strategies coming online. And this one interests me. Some of the thylacines
that were being turned in to zoos, sanctuaries, even at the museums, had collar marks on the neck. They were being kept as pets, and we know a lot
of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets, and they say they were
wonderful, friendly. This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around
the fireplace to go to sleep. A wild animal. 16:34And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this. If it had not been illegal
to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now? And I'm positive it wouldn't. We need to think
about this in today's world. Could it be that getting animals
close to us so that we value them, maybe they won't go extinct? And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that, we're going to watch more of these animals
plunge off the precipice. 17:05As far as I'm concerned, this is why we're trying to do
these kinds of de-extinction projects. We are trying to restore
that balance of nature that we have upset. 17:15Thank you. 17:17(Applause)"

I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2; that is the weight of two elephants. I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year. So what do I have to do? I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home? (Laughter) I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time. (Laughter) 00:40In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet. I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. 00:57Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution. You know the problem; we don't want to believe what we know. In Alberta people work nonstop, 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can. We know about the end of oil. Oil sand is not a long-term solution. But we use three times more oil than we find every year. We don't want to believe what we know. Deny. 01:37Coral reef in New Caledonia. 100 percent of the coral may be wiped out before 2050 because of global warming. And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature, and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. 01:59North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago. Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific. The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960. 02:25There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. Sad picture. It lost 80 percent of its ice. According to scientists, in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone. Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. Like Al Gore told you, two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. 02:53Return of fish men. One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited. According to FAO, if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050. We don't want to believe what we know. 03:25The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa. One human of six have not enough to eat in the world. One billion people have not enough to eat. In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places. Here in America, 90 percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. 03:55Palm tree plantation in Borneo. Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation. 04:09Refugee camp in Darfur. Today we have 20 million refugees in the world. According to the U.N., we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050. 04:27I always show my pictures in the street. We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities. But how to understand the world without the voice of people? Landscape was not enough. It was obvious to me to do another work. I launched a project named Six Billion Others. I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question, the same crucial question, about life. We have done five thousand interviews. I'm going to show you this. 05:12Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life? It's when my dad told me, ""Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."" 05:22Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it. 05:26Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha, this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ... 05:32Woman: You're asking me a hard question. 05:34Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do? 05:37Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,) Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.) Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.) 05:47Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic. 05:53Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today. Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful. 06:0010th Man: In the word life, you have the life. 06:0211th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question? 06:0812th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people, I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet. Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons. I feel ashamed. And I feel humbled by their strength. And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. 06:38Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up. You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work. My family ... What can I say? At the moment, my family is very poor, my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty. If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. Thank you. Thank you for having fed me and raised me, and for making my life of today. Thank you. 07:3413th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair. I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive. After many people said I couldn't do that. And I think that comes from connecting with nature, connecting with the energy of life, because we're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually, mentally or physically. I got the easy part. 08:0814th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other. You come from elsewhere. You don't know me. I don't know you. We talk without lying. If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends. How can we make it all by ourselves? 08:50(Applause) 08:58YAB: You can also go to the website, answer -- respond to the questions also. Forty crucial questions. 09:05Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. For the last three years, I was shooting the earth for the movie. The name of the movie is ""Home"" -- ""Maison."" It is about the state of the planet. It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. I'm very proud to show you the teaser. 09:30Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old. These plants, several hundred million years old. And we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years. We've managed to adapt, and have conquered the whole planet. For generations, we've been raising our children, not unlike millions of other species living beside us. For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet. We depend on water, forests, deserts, oceans. Fishing, breeding, farming are still the world's foremost human occupations. And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. We all share the same need for the earth's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves, and become better. And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. 11:09Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. In less than 50 years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind. Half of the world's forests have vanished. Water resources are running low. Intensive farming is depleting soils. Our energy sources are not sustainable. The climate is changing. We are endangering ourselves. We're only trying to improve our lives. But the wealth gaps are growing wider. We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. We know that solutions are available today. We all have the power to change this trend for the better. So what are we waiting for? (Applause) 13:01YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie. But it is not a normal movie. The film is going to be distributed free. This film has no copyright. On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet. The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. There is no business on this movie. It is also available for school, cities, NGOs and you. 13:49We have to believe what we know. Let me tell you something. It's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late. We have all a part of the solutions. To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk. Merci beaucoup. I love you. (Applause)"
1,What comes after An Inconvenient Truth?,Al Gore,May 2009,"At TED2009, Al Gore presents updated slides from around the globe to make the case that worrying climate trends are even worse than scientists predicted, and to make clear his stance on ""clean coal.""", (31K),"Transcript (47 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDanskDeutschEnglishEspañolEsperantoFilipinoFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoKiswahiliLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsNorsk bokmålNorsk nynorskPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάМонголРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиՀայրենעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىবাংলাગુજરાતીதமிழ்ಕನ್ನಡภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years. The permanent ice is marked in red. As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer. The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here. In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 00:54This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. Video: Whoa! (Laughter) Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 01:41And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. This is an annual melting river. But the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly. At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland. 02:22In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers. 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. The flows have increased. But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs. And the predictions, as you've read, are serious. 02:50This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75. This is a completely unsustainable pattern. If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. 03:17In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans. Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem. The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China. And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 03:54But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. (Applause) However there is a political battle in our country. And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something. (Laughter) Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America. This happened around Christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. 04:37Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul. He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow. Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay. 04:52Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. 05:01Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about. 05:07Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them, part of one of them. 05:14Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. The fact is, coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean -- smells good, too. So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us. (Laughter) 05:39Video: Actor: Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it. So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility. Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud. But that's the sound of clean coal technology. And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology. 06:07Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. 06:13Video: Narrator: America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis. The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil. But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years. A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming. Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower America. Find out more. 06:42Al Gore: This is the last one. 06:51Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America. One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid. Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs. Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real. 07:14Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says, ""If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" We need to go far, quickly. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

wonders of the world, what do you see? The greatness of the Pyramids of Giza or maybe the amazing
aqueducts of Ancient Rome? Both of these are amazing
feats of human innovation. 00:16As an architect, I've often wondered why do we
monumentalize the ancient wonders of civilizations that collapsed
such a long time ago? I've traveled the world
studying ancient innovation, and what I've found are Indigenous
technologies from living cultures that are still in use. And some of these cultures
you may have never heard of. They live in the most
remote places on earth, facing environmental extremes
like desert drought and frequent flooding for generations. 00:50footnotefootnoteA couple of years ago,
I traveled to northern India to a place overlooking
the plains of Bangladesh where the Khasi people live in a forest that receives more rainfall
than anywhere else on earth. And during the monsoon season, travel between villages
is cut off by these floods, which transform this entire landscape from a forested canopy
into isolated islands. This hill tribe has evolved
living root bridges that are created
by guiding and growing tree roots that you can barely wrap your arms around through a carefully woven scaffolding. Multiple generations of the Khasi men
and the women and the children, they'll take care of these roots as they grow to the other
side of that bank, where they're then planted
to make a structure that will get stronger with age. This 1,500-year-old tradition
of growing living root bridges has produced 75
of these incredible structures. And while they take 50 years to grow, in this landscape
they actually last for centuries. 01:56All across the globe, I've seen cultures who have been
living with floods for thousands of years by evolving these ancient technologies
that allow them to work with the water. In the southern wetlands of Iraq, which are formed by the confluence
of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, a unique, water-based civilization lives. For 6,000 years,
the Maʿdān have floated villages on man-made islands that are constructed
from a single species of reed that grows around them. 02:27And the Qasab reed
is integral to every aspect of life. It is food for water buffalo, flour for humans and building material
for these biodegradable, buoyant islands and their cathedral-like houses that they construct
in as little as three days. And this dried Qasab reed, it can be bundled into columns, it can be woven into floors
or roofs or walls, and it can also be twisted into a rope that's used to bind these buildings
without the use of any nails. The Maʿdān villages
are constructed in the marsh, as they have been for generations, on islands that stay afloat
for over 25 years. 03:16Although global attention
is focused on the pandemic, cities are still sinking
and sea levels are still rising. And high-tech solutions are definitely going to help us
solve some of these problems, but in our rush towards the future, we tend to forget about the past. 03:34footnotefootnoteIn other parts of the world,
where rivers are contaminated with sewage, a city of 15 million people cleans
its waste water with its flood plains. On the edges of Calcutta, flanked by a smoking
escarpment of the city's trash and ribboned by its highways, an Indigenous technology of 300 fish ponds cleans its water while producing its food. And through a combination
of sunshine and sewage and a symbiosis
between algae and bacteria, the wastewater is broken down. Fish ponds continue
this cleaning of the water in a process that takes around 30 days. 04:17And this innovation, it's not just a model for chemical
and coal-power-free purification. Since Calcutta's core
has no formal treatment, it's the city's only way
of cleaning the water downstream before it enters the Bay of Bengal. What I find so unbelievable
about this infrastructure is that as cities across the world
in Asia and in Europe begin to replicate this exact system, Calcutta is now struggling to save it
from being displaced by development. 04:51And then to deal with flooding
in a completely other way, the Tofinu tribe has developed
the largest lake city in Africa. Ganvié, meaning ""We survived,"" is built of stilted houses that are
organized around a canal system that you can navigate by dugout canoe. And the royal square stands
amongst 3,000 stilted buildings that include a post office, a bank, a mosque and even a couple of bars that are all surrounded
by 12,000 individual fish paddocks, or mangrove acadjas. This chemical-free artificial reef
covers almost half of the lagoon and feeds one million people
that are living around it. 05:36What amazes me is that while an individual acadja
is pretty insignificant, when it's multiplied by 12,000, it creates an Indigenous technology
the scale of industrial aquaculture, which is the greatest threat
to our mangrove ecosystems ... but this technology -- it builds more biodiversity than before. 06:00Just earlier this year,
when I was back home in Australia, the craziest thing happened. The burned ash from the bushfires
surrounding Sydney rained down on us on Bondi Beach. And worried about carbon emissions -- not viral transmissions -- we were already wearing masks. The air was so choked by a plume of smoke that was so big that it reached
as far away as New Zealand. Then in the midst of these wildfires, which were the worst
we'd ever seen on record, something unexpected happened, but incredibly amazing. The ancestral lands in Australia, where Indigenous fire-stick
farming was practiced, were saved as these fires
raged around them. And these ancient forests -- they survived because of seasonal,
generational burning, which is an Aboriginal practice
of lighting small, slow and cool fires. 06:52So though wildfires
are a natural disaster, as a consequence of climate change, they're also man-made. And what's so amazing about this
is we have the ancient technology that we know can help prevent them, and we've used it for thousands of years. And what I find so fascinating
about these technologies is how complex they are and how attuned they are to nature. And then, how resilient
we could all become by learning from them. 07:22Too often when we are faced with a crisis,
we build walls in defense. I'm an architect, and I've been trained
to seek solutions in permanence -- concrete, steel, glass -- these are all used to build
a fortress against nature. But my search for ancient systems
and Indigenous technologies has been different. It's been inspired by an idea
that we can seed creativity in crisis. 07:50We have thousands of years
of ancient knowledge that we just need to listen to and allow it to expand our thinking
about designing symbiotically with nature. And by listening, we'll only become wiser and ready for those
21st-century challenges that we know will endanger
our people and our planet. And I've seen it. I know that it's possible."

How can agriculture stay resilient and grow with the times?

(This virtual co...", (40K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)00:00Corey Hajim: Here with me today
is Beth Ford, the CEO of Land O'Lakes, a farming cooperative that works
across the United States and in dozens of countries
around the world. And she's going to share with us
her vision about how to create a better future for farmers that's both environmentally
and economically sustainable. Hi, Beth, thank you so much
for being here. 00:22Beth Ford: Thanks for the invitation,
I'm looking forward to the conversation. 00:26CH: Let's first talk
about the broadband issue. How big of a problem is this and how does it affect
the farming community, both as you said,
as families and as businesses? 00:37BF: So the estimates have been that 18 million Americans
lack broadband access, 14 million are in rural America. Now, having said that, the broadband -- I'm trying to remember
what the name of the organization is, did a study and they actually say the number is more like 42 million. And the reason is
the mapping is inaccurate. So what could happen is, let's say you have a 7-Eleven in a town and that has Wi-Fi or broadband access
because they laid a line. It would show up on the map as though that community
largely has broadband and it does not. And so it's a significant issue. Think about the education
of your children. I know you have three, I have three. And many of them
were doing remote schooling. Well, what's happening on the farm, this is legitimately what's occurring, is that the teacher from the town is driving paper homework out to the farms to give them the homework so that they can continue to go to school. And that's just one example of many. And so this is a major challenge,
because if we don't have basic wiring, I can say we need like a 1930s'
rural electric initiative where we go across the country and we make this, this should be a right, this should be something that is a basic,
like mail delivery and electricity. This should not be just
for those who have. And the scale of it is, the estimate is to be 80
to 100 billion dollars to close this gap. 02:00But the challenge of that
is that you get the funding and then how is it implemented? We all know you can't just say -- I say, well, I don't go in
as CEO, go to the board, say I need 100 million dollars
for this tech platform and then, ""Approved. Here's the return."" And then I go in and I throw it
to the business unit heads and I'm like, ""You guys decide
who's in charge of that,"" right? And there's a little bit about it, it becomes a jump ball
between the FCC and the USDA and then the governors, and suddenly we don't have enough and we're on the couches
looking for quarters and nickels to pay the pizza guy so that we can finish this off, as though it's not a priority,
as though it's not a priority. As though it's somebody else's problem. And it is all of our problem. This is a national security issue. I cannot say it more directly. 02:49So it's a major issue
because I'm concerned about speed here in addition to the funding. And the good news is
this has been bipartisan support. Whenever I speak, I speak
for the National Governors Association, the State Department of AG, I mean, name it. Name the administration
official, I've done it. This isn't a bipartisan issue. It has to be a prioritization issue. It has to be something that we decide
as a country is a priority. And it means in every state. 03:18CH: I've heard stories about, ""Well, you've put Wi-Fi"" or in some of these communities, they've put Wi-Fi on the buses
and then, you know, kids are sitting outside
the local library or the local McDonald's to do their homework. And it's just so unfair. 03:36BF: It's unacceptable. 03:37CH: Unacceptable.
Unacceptable is the right word. It also affects the businesses, right? Farming as a business because there's so much
technology being used. 03:50BF: Well, there is. So oftentimes I'm at an event and they're talking
about all this cool new tech. And listen, I just say
we use satellite technology, we have big data, data and analytics, John Deere's tractors are auto-steer. And I'm like, ""Are you using that?"" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""Well, because I lose connection. And so I can't I can't utilize it."" You know, there's so many
exciting investments and innovation occurring in the sector
that will make farmers more efficient, will be better for climate
and the environment, I'll talk a little bit
about that in a minute, but none of that can be used if we don't have the appropriate
technology access, if we don't have broadband. These are data-intensive models and they require bandwidth to do so and to utilize them effectively. So it's a major issue
so that from a business perspective, it's an efficiency,
it's a sustainable production issue. 04:47And then back to the community, again, stable operating environment. You know, I constantly have
my mother in my ear, like, ""You're only as happy
as your least happy child,"" right? And why is that? Because, you know, if you can't feel confident
your child has the best education, has access to a doctor, pretty hard to be focused
on your business. And farming is a business. And so we have to recognize
if there's a number of hospitals, local hospitals have shut down, there's no banking, no housing. It doesn't work to have a stable
operating environment in these farming communities. And yes, directly, you cannot use
the new innovation and technology that hide the data utilization
if you do not have broadband. 05:37CH: So the technology is a challenge, and as you said, it's so important
for the business, and you mentioned climate. So I'd love to dive into that because in addition to, sort of,
challenging market dynamics, you also have climate volatility
and an increasing weather volatility and technology's helping to address that. Can you talk a little bit
about the technology that's being used by farmers
to manage that volatility? 06:04BH: Well, first of all,
what you're helping them do is make improved decisions
that make their farms more resilient and that they can make
more sustainable business practices. So what we've started, we have a business called Truterra, it's run by Jason Weller, who used to run in our CS
under the Obama administration. And what this business does,
it works in multiple ways. We work through our local
retailer, the agronomists. They get insights from
our Truterra insights engine. It literally is at the farm level, acre by acre, where they can understand
what the soil type is, what the water situation is,
all of those things, what kind of tractor do you use, how many passes at the field do you make. So, we can make improved, sustainable production decisions. More recently, probably just last week,
we announced our Trucarbon platform, which is a systemic way
that we can work with farmers, databased. This is partnered with
the Soil Health Institute, with many environmental groups, to create a carbon credit. So where the farmer is making a decision
that is improving carbon capture and at the same time is improving
their own profitability, and then is able to monetize that. Our first customer was Microsoft, and they're using this for carbon credit. 07:24So why is this so important? In addition to the fact
that we have validation and this is an evolving marketplace, carbon and carbon credits,
carbon offsets, it's an unstructured pricing environment. And I think all the studies would show
that agriculture is a great way for us to address this issue
using basic photosynthesis. So if we if we agree that, then we have to say,
what is that pricing environment? One of the fundamental things
we started with is the farmer. In fact, Secretary Vilsack more recently
said in his confirmation hearing, we've got to start with the farmer and that farmer has to be profitable
when making that decision. It's a virtuous circle. So we want the farmer to take action. But you can't just say,
""Everybody put on cover crops. That's the best."" Because then that farmer isn't profitable, and then how do we make sure
that we can sustain our food production and the farm? 08:15So we're working with this inside engine, with our agronomic advice, with soil health and soil testing, with any number of pieces of data
and process and expertise. And that's what differentiates,
I think, our approach, that it goes right back to the farm level but leverages technology. We have a partnership with Microsoft, their FarmBeats program, their airband. They're working with us on closing this digital divide
in different communities so we can take advantage
of these opportunities. And at the same time, as I said, they were our first customer
for our carbon credits. And one of the reasons
I'm so focused on this, not just because this is
an evolving marketplace, and because climate change
is something we have to address and we want to address, and I believe farmers
are part of the solution. They are a major part
and a major opportunity for solution. It also is another
revenue source for farmers. And go back to that statistic I gave you
about the ""hobby"" farmer, about the fact that they're working
off the farm to retain their farms. And the reality is, there's going to be
even more disruption in the coming years in this sector. It will be in some ways driven by the electrification
of the transportation sector. That means biofuel utilization and a significant portion of the corn crop
goes into biofuels, ethanol. And if that is no longer needed, because we've gone to electric vehicles
over the next 10 years, what happens to corn price,
to land values? And at the same time soybeans, some of that is used for biodiesel. So that will be a major disruptor
to row crop farming. So we've got to point farmers,
they're pretty smart, to the right levels
of investment they can make for other sources of potential
revenue for their farms. And I think that this is a great way
to think about it. 10:09CH: Right, so you feel like the things that farmers can do
to be more environmentally sustainable can also help them economically? 10:18BF: Exactly. And it must. It must. And that's why this model that we have,
Truterra Insights Engine, is iterative almost. Hey, if I do these three things,
what happens to my profitability? And it might be tied to a program
that's available at the state level, it might be tied to improve variable
rate application of your fertilizer where you don't put everything
on at the same time and then have it seep into the soil. Instead, you look and you use
your satellite technology and everything and you say, ""Oh, I'm going to
put partial on now, and maybe I don't need as much later."" Every piece, every acre
on a farm is not the same and doesn't have the opportunity
to yield as much, one acre to the next. And with that then, where do you make the right investments? And a model like this helps you understand
where to make those investments. We also have applied research plots, answer plots, where we help
with our agronomists to help improve the planting
decisions a farmer may make. So there's any number of variables, and I say it makes a farm more resilient. And let's agree, we're going to get into a situation
where the financial markets and the bankers are going to say, you need to be making investments
that make your farm more resilient, given the amount of disruption
we're seeing already, right? Climate. Think of the fires in the west,
the freeze in the south, in Texas, and we're going to see these events
over the next number of years. We have to make the farm more resilient. That makes it more profitable
for the farmer. It helps their ability
to make an investment that we all know is necessary. 11:52CH: But you mentioned
that it can also be a revenue source. Can you give an example of how, you know, a climate mitigation technique also provides revenue for a farmer? 12:05BF: Well, there's two things. One, I was just mentioning
more directly, this true carbon, where you're generating a carbon credit because you're able to prove the new practices you're putting in place
is going to reduce that. You use that proof
for the soil test in advance, and then a number of years later. You may use a stabilizer, for instance, and that would mean that you don't have
some of your nitrogen you're putting on or using, kind of, seep into the soil. That, in and of itself, means you have less of investment
you have to make in those products as you're putting on fertilizer or planting different crops. But then more directly,
that credit that you develop, because this market is evolving, can be sold. So what we're doing with the Microsoft
partnership here and their purchases, if you are able to prove
this tonnage reduction, it's like 20 dollars a met ton
for carbon credit, so it's a more direct line payment
for that in and of itself. And that's an evolving marketplace
we're going to see. We're also partnered with Nori,
it's a platform like eBay, and they want to be the eBay
of carbon credit trading. This is very early stage,
but it's an exciting opportunity because we know it's going to take
this kind of innovation, this creation, this technology to address climate change. And the farmers can be in a position where they can be part of the solution. 13:30CH: Thanks for being here, Beth. 13:32BF: You bet."
1,Our moral imperative to act on climate change — and 3 steps we can take (English voiceover),His Holiness Pope Francis,Jan 2021,"The global climate crisis will require us to transform the way we act, says His Holiness Pope Francis. Delivering a visionary TED Talk from Vatican City, the spiritual leader proposes three courses of action to address the world's growing environmental problems and economic inequalities, illustrating how all of us can work together, across faiths and societies, to protect the Earth and promote the dignity of everyone. ""The future is built today,"" he says. ""And it is not built in i...", (3K),"Transcript (1 Language)English00:05Hello. We are living during a historic moment
that's marked by difficult challenges, as we all know, on the East Coast, so that the world is shaken
by the crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic,
which highlights yet an even bigger challenge now kuraishi
social and social environmental crisis. This requires us, all of us,
to face a choice. The choice between what matters
and what doesn't change the choice between continuing to ignore the suffering of the poorest Yamal and
to abuse our common home, the planet, or in or engaging at every level that
it has to transform the way we act. Science tells us every day with more
precision that urgent action is needed and I'm not dramatizing here,
this is what science says if we are to keep the hope of avoiding
radical and catastrophic climate change. And for this, we must act now that
this is a scientific fact on our conscience tells us that we cannot remain indifferent to
the suffering of those in need and recognition, these sort of
growing economic inequalities and social injustices. And that's the economy itself cannot be limited
to production and distribution, and it must also consider its impacts
on both the environment and on the dignity of people. But we could say that the economy
should be strictly a creative. In itself and in its methods. In the way it acts, creative creativity, what I would like to invite you
to go on a journey together, a journey of transformation and of
action made not so much of words, but rather of concrete
and pressing actions. I'm calling it a journey because
it requires a shift, a change that came from this crisis. None
of us must come out to the same. We cannot come out to the same from a
crisis we never come out of the same. It will take time. Effort and hard work to overcome it. We will have to take it one step
at a time of the week, persuade those in doubt. Imagine new solutions and commit
to carry them out. Our goal is clear to build an approach
within the next decade, plus a world where we can meet the needs
of the present generations and. Included, including everyone since her
compromise without compromising the possibilities of future generations. I would like to invite all people
of faith, Christian or not. And all people of goodwill. I intend
to embark on this journey. From your own faith, or if you do not have
a faith from your own intention, from your own good, will each one of us
as individuals or members of a group, families, communities of faith, businesses
, associations, institutions, can make a substantial contribution. Only five years ago, I wrote the
encyclical letter Lerato C, dedicated to the care of our common home. She proposes the concept of integral
ecology to respond, to respond together to
the cry of the Earth, as well as to the cry of the poor ecology. Integrally integral ecology is an
invitation to an integral vision on life aberrated, starting from the
conviction that everything in the world is connected and that, as the
pandemic made sure to remind us, we are interdependent on each other. And
that, as well as on our Mother Earth. The television from such
a vision stems to the need to find new ways
of defining progress and measuring insincerely mythology
without limiting ourselves to the economic, technological, financial
and gross product aspects not done, but rather giving central relevance
to its ethical, social and educational dimensions. But I would like to propose today
three courses of action. Got to see, as I wrote in Lerato see the
change and the right orientation for our journey of integral ecology
required first that we all take an educational step. We. So my first suggestion is
to promote at every level and education geared towards the care
of our common home and developing the understanding that environmental
problems are linked to human needs. You must understand this
from the beginning, that you need to establish environmental
problems are tied to human needs and education based on scientific
data and on an ethical approach. This is important, both of
them being encouraged by the fact that many young people
already show a new ecological and social awareness and many of them
fight generously for the defense of the environment and for justice. As a second proposal today, we must
focus on water and nutrition. Access to safe and drinkable water is an
essential and universal human right. And embracing it is essential because
it determines the survival of people and therefore is a condition for
the exercise of all the rights and responsibilities as an element, as
providing adequate nutrition for all through nondestructive farming methods
should become the main purpose of the entire cycle of food production
and distribution. That has proposed the third suggestion
is about energy transition. Who knows how a gradual replacement,
but without delay of fossil fuels, with clean energy sources? We only have a few years essentiality,
Galchen scientists estimate approximately, maybe less than 30. We have
a few years, less than 30, 30 years to drastically reduce greenhouse
gas emissions into the atmosphere. Davis is not only must this transition be
quick and capable of meeting present and future energy needs, he said it also
must be attentive to the impact on the poor, on local populations, as well as on those who work in
the energy production sectors. One way to encourage this change
is to lead businesses towards the urgent need to commit themselves to the integral care of our common home
is excluding from investments those companies that do not meet the parameters
of integral ecology and equally, while rewarding those that
work concretely during this transitional phase, change the law to
put sustainability, social justice and the promotion
of the common good at the center of their activities. Well, they already said
many organizations, Catholic and of other faiths, have already taken on the responsibility
to act in this direction. In fact, in fact, the earth
must be worked and nursed, cultivated and protected. We cannot continue to squeeze
it like an orange. And we can say that this request taking
care of the Earth is a human right. These three proposals must
be considered as part of a larger group of actions that
we must carry out in an integrated way in order to find a
lasting solution to these problems. The current economic system
is unsustainable. From there, we are faced with
the moral imperative and the practical urgency to rethink
many things the way we produce, the way we consume our culture of waste,
our short term vision, the exploitation of the poor and
our indifference towards them. The growing inequalities and our
dependence on harmful energy sources. And we need to think about
all these challenges, ecology and integral ecology suggests
a new conception of the relationship between
us humans and nature. We support this leads to
a new economy where the production of wealth is directed
to the integral well-being of the human being and to the improvement,
not the destruction of our coming home. It also implies a renewed politics
conceived as one of the highest forms of charity. She yes. Love is interpersonal, but
love is also political. It involves all peoples and
it involves nature. Need to be there for all of you
to embark on this journey. That they proposed in order to. And
also my new encyclical fatality. As the term countdown's suggests,
we must act with urgency. So each one of us can play
a precious role. So if we all begin our journey today,
not tomorrow, today, because the future is built today. And she goes to it and it is
not built in isolation, but rather in community and
in harmony. Thank you."
1,What if there were 1 trillion more trees?,Jean-François Bastin,Oct 2020,"Today humanity produces more than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 to restore the balance of greenhouse gases. Like all plants, trees consume atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis. So what can trees do to help in this fight? Jean-François Bastin digs into the efforts to restore depleted ecosystems. [Directed by Lobster Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Fabrizio Martini].", (92K),"Transcript (23 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیதமிழ்中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語00:07Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree
on the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help
in this fight? And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place? 00:55Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis. This process uses energy 
from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, 
converting them to energy and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies
and decays, some of its carbon will be released
back into the air. A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil, where it can remain 
for thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere. 01:55So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution. Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms, and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones; species that already play a role 
in their local environment. Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition for resources and better resist
climate change. This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. 02:58There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary
for human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised
the scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions. 03:53More than half of the potential
forest canopy for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030. 04:12But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended 
consequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change. And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas, future generations would need
to protect them from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them. 04:52Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction 
necessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern
trees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans."

walking, but leaping. Except, our collective alarm
seems to be busted. Faced with a crisis,
we often fall apart, regress and that becomes a window
for antidemocratic forces to push societies backwards,
to become more unequal and more unstable. 01:14Ten years ago, I wrote
about this backwards process and I called it the ""Shock Doctrine."" So what determines which road
we navigate through crisis? Whether we grow up fast
and find those strengths or whether we get knocked back. And I'd say this is
a pressing question these days. Because things are
pretty shocking out there. Record-breaking storms, drowning cities, record-breaking fires
threatening to devour them, thousands of migrants
disappearing beneath the waves. And openly supremacist movements rising, in many of our countries
there are torches in the streets. And now there's no shortage
of people who are sounding the alarm. But as a society,
I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding
with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crises
demand from us. And yet, we know from history that it is possible for crisis
to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap. 02:26And one of the most striking examples
of this progressive power of crisis is the Great Crash of 1929. There was the shock
of the sudden market collapse followed by all of the aftershocks, the millions who lost everything
thrown onto breadlines. And this was taken by many as a message
that the system itself was broken. And many people listened
and they leapt into action. In the United States and elsewhere,
governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs
like social security to catch people. There were huge job-creating
public investments in housing, electrification and transit. And there was a wave
of aggressive regulation to reign in the banks. 03:18Now, these reforms were far from perfect. In the US, African American workers,
immigrants and women were largely excluded. But the Depression period, along with the transformation
of allied nations and economies during the World War II effort, show us that it is possible
for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves
in the face of a collective threat. Now, when we tell this story
of the 1929 Crash, that's usually the formula
that it follows -- that there was a shock
and it induced a wake-up call and that produced a leap to a safer place. 04:01Now, if that's really what it took, then why isn't it working anymore? Why do today's non-stop shocks -- why don't they spur us into action? Why don't they produce leaps? Especially when it comes
to climate change. 04:17So I want to talk to you today about what I think is a much more
complete recipe for deep transformation catalyzed by shocking events. And I'm going to focus
on two key ingredients that usually get left out
of the history books. 04:33One has to do with imagination,
the other with organization. Because it's in the interplay
between the two where revolutionary power lies. So let's start with imagination. The victories of the New Deal
didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood
the brutalities of laissez-faire. This was a time, let's remember,
of tremendous ideological ferment, when many different ideas
about how to organize societies did battle with one another
in the public square. A time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of futures, many of them organized
along radically egalitarian lines. Now, not all of these ideas were good but this was an era
of explosive imagining. This meant that the movements
demanding change knew what they were against --
crushing poverty, widening inequality -- but just as important,
they knew what they were for. They had their ""no""
and they had their ""yes,"" too. They also had very different
models of political organization than we do today. 05:44For decades, social and labor movements had been building up
their membership bases, linking their causes together
and increasing their strength. Which meant that by the time
the Crash happened, there was already a movement
that was large and broad enough to, for instance, stage strikes
that didn't just shut down factories, but shut down entire cities. The big policy wins of the New Deal
were actually offered as compromises. Because the alternative
seemed to be revolution. 06:18So, let's adjust
that equation from earlier. A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle, that's how we get a real leap. 06:31So how does our present moment measure up? We are living, once again, at a time
of extraordinary political engagements. Politics is a mass obsession. Progressive movements are growing
and resisting with tremendous courage. And yet, we know from history
that ""no"" is not enough. Now, there are some ""yeses""
out there that are emerging. And they're actually getting
a lot bolder quickly. Where climate activists
used to talk about changing light bulbs, now we're pushing
for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun, wind and waves, and to do it fast. Movements catalyzed
by police violence against black bodies are calling for an end
to militarized police, mass incarceration and even for reparations for slavery. Students are not just
opposing tuition increases, but from Chile to Canada to the UK, they are calling for free tuition
and debt cancellation. And yet, this still doesn't add up to the kind of holistic
and universalist vision of a different world
than our predecessors had. So why is that? 07:45Well, very often
we think about political change in defined compartments these days. Environment in one box,
inequality in another, racial and gender justice
in a couple of other boxes, education over here, health over there. And within each compartment, there are thousands upon thousands
of different groups and NGOs, each competing with one another
for credit, name recognition and of course, resources. In other words, we act
a lot like corporate brands. Now, this is often referred to
as the problem of silos. Now, silos are understandable. They carve up our complex world
into manageable chunks. They help us feel less overwhelmed. But in the process,
they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue comes up and when somebody else's issue
needs our help and support. And they also keep us from seeing
glaring connections between our issues. 08:51So for instance, the people fighting
poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change. Even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable
to extreme weather. The climate change people
rarely talk about war and occupation. Even though we know
that the thirst for fossil fuels has been a major driver of conflict. The environmental movement
has gotten better at pointing out that the nations that are getting
hit hardest by climate change are populated overwhelmingly
by black and brown people. But when black lives
are treated as disposable in prisons, in schools and on the streets, these connections are too rarely made. 09:35The walls between our silos also means that our solutions,
when they emerge, are also disconnected from each other. So progressives now have this long list
of demands that I was mentioning earlier, those ""yeses."" But what we're still missing is that coherent picture
of the world we're fighting for. What it looks like, what it feels like,
and most of all, what its core values are. And that really matters. Because when large-scale crises hit us and we are confronted with the need
to leap somewhere safer, there isn't any agreement
on what that place is. And leaping without a destination looks a lot like jumping up and down. 10:19(Laughter) 10:20Fortunately, there are all kinds
of conversations and experiments going on to try to overcome these divisions
that are holding us back. And I want to finish
by talking about one of them. 10:30A couple of years ago,
a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
in our various silos. So we locked ourselves
in a room for two days, and we tried to figure out
what bound us together. In that room were people
who rarely get face to face. There were indigenous elders
with hipsters working on transit. There was the head of Greenpeace with a union leader
representing oil workers and loggers. There were faith leaders
and feminist icons and many more. And we gave ourselves
a pretty ambitious assignment: agreeing on a short statement
describing the world after we win. The world after we've already
made the transition to a clean economy and a much fairer society. In other words, instead of trying to scare people
about what will happen if we don't act, we decided to try to inspire them
with what could happen if we did act. 11:31Sensible people are always telling us that change needs to come
in small increments. That politics is the art of the possible and that we can't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good. Well, we rejected all of that. We wrote a manifesto,
and we called it ""The Leap."" I have to tell you
that agreeing on our common ""yes"" across such diversity of experiences and against a backdrop
of a lot of painful history was not easy work. But it was also pretty thrilling. Because as soon as we gave ourselves
permission to dream, those threads connecting
much of our work became self-evident. 12:12We realized, for instance, that the bottomless quest for profits that is forcing so many people
to work more than 50 hours a week, without security, and that is fueling
this epidemic of despair is the same quest for bottomless
profits and endless growth that is at the heart
of our ecological crisis and is destabilizing our planet. It also became clear what we need to do. We need to create
a culture of care-taking. In which no one
and nowhere is thrown away. In which the inherent value of all people
and every ecosystem is foundational. So we came up with this people's platform, and don't worry, I'm not going to read
the whole thing to you out loud -- if you're interested,
you can read it at theleap.org. But I will give you a taste
of what we came up with. 13:06So we call for that 100 percent
renewable economy in a hurry, but we went further. Calls for new kinds of trade deals, a robust debate
on a guaranteed annual income, full rights for immigrant workers, getting corporate money out of politics, free universal day care,
electoral reform and more. What we discovered
is that a great many of us are looking for permission to act
less like brands and more like movements. Because movements don't care about credit. They want good ideas
to spread far and wide. What I love about The Leap is that it rejects the idea
that there is this hierarchy of crisis, and it doesn't ask anyone
to prioritize one struggle over another or wait their turn. And though it was birthed in Canada, we've discovered that it travels well. Since we launched, The Leap
has been picked up around the world with similar platforms, being written from Nunavut to Australia, to Norway to the UK and the US, where it's gaining a lot of traction
in cities like Los Angeles, where it's being localized. And also in rural communities
that are traditionally very conservative, but where politics is failing
the vast majority of people. 14:25Here's what I've learned from studying
shocks and disasters for two decades. Crises test us. We either fall apart or we grow up fast. Finding new reserves of strength
and capacity that we never knew we had. The shocking events
that fill us with dread today can transform us, and they can
transform the world for the better. But first we need to picture the world
that we're fighting for. And we have to dream it up together. Right now, every alarm in our house
is going off simultaneously. It's time to listen. It's time to leap. 15:11Thank you. 15:12(Applause)"
1,A small country with big ideas to get rid of fossil fuels,Monica Araya,Aug 2016,"How do we build a society without fossil fuels? Using her native Costa Rica as an example of positive action on environmental protection and renewables, climate advocate Monica Araya outlines a bold vision for a world committed to clean energy in all sectors.", (44K),"Transcript (31 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیภาษาไทยქართული中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01How do we build a society without fossil fuels? 00:06This is a very complex challenge, and I believe developing countries
could take the lead in this transition. And I'm aware that this
is a contentious statement, but the reality is that so much
is at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay
at the center of our development. We can do it differently. And it's time, it really is time, to debunk the myth that a country has to choose
between development on the one hand and environmental protection,
renewables, quality of life, on the other. 00:49I come from Costa Rica,
a developing country. We are nearly five million people, and we live right in the middle
of the Americas, so it's very easy
to remember where we live. Nearly 100 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources, five of them. 01:14(Applause) 01:18Hydropower, geothermal, wind, solar, biomass. 01:27Did you know that last year, for 299 days, we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity? It's a fantastic achievement, and yet, it hides a paradox, which is that nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil. 01:59Why? Because of our transportation system, which is totally dependent
on fossil fuels, like it is in most countries. So if we think of the energy
transition as a marathon, the question is, how do we get
to the finish line, how do we decarbonize
the rest of the economy? And it's fair to say
that if we don't succeed, it's difficult to see who will. So that is why I want
to talk to you about Costa Rica, because I believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision
for development without fossil fuels. 02:39If you know one thing about our country, it's that we don't have an army. So I'm going to take you back to 1948. That year, the country
was coming out of civil war. Thousands of Costa Ricans had died, and families were bitterly split. And yet, a surprising idea
won the hearts and minds: we would reboot the country, and that Second Republic
would have no army. So we abolished it. And the president at the time, José Figueres, found a powerful way
by smashing the walls of an army base. The following year, 1949, we made that decision permanent
in the new constitution, and that is why I can tell you that story
nearly 70 years later. And I'm grateful. I'm grateful they made that decision
before I was born, because it allowed me
and millions of others to live in a very stable country. 03:49And you might be thinking
that it was good luck, but it wasn't. There was a pattern of deliberate choices. In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given
free education and free health care. We called that social guarantees. By abolishing the army, we were able to turn military spending
into social spending, and that was a driver of stability. In the '50s -- 04:17(Applause) 04:22In the '50s, we started
investing in hydropower, and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels
for electricity generation, which is what the world
is struggling with today. In the '70s we invested in national parks, and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic
of growth, growth, growth at any cost that you see others embracing,
especially in the developing world. In the '90s, we pioneered payments
for ecosystem services, and that helped us reverse deforestation and boosted ecotourism,
which today is a key engine of growth. So investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy. Quite the opposite. 05:07And it doesn't mean we are perfect, and it doesn't mean
we don't have contradictions. That's not the point. The point is that,
by making our own choices, we were able to develop resilience
in dealing with development problems. 05:24footnotefootnoteAlso, if you take a country like ours, the GDP per capita
is around 11,000 dollars, depending on how you measure it. But according to
the Social Progress Index, we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning GDP
into social progress. Abolishing the army, investing in nature and people, did something very powerful, too. It shaped the narrative, the narrative of a small country
with big ideas, and it was very empowering
to grow up with that narrative. 05:59So the question is, what is the next big idea
for this generation? And I believe what comes next is for this generation
to let go of fossil fuels for good, just as we did with the army. 06:18Fossil fuels create climate change. We know that, and we know how vulnerable we are
to the impacts of climate change. So as a developing country,
it is in our best interest to build development without fossil fuels that harm people in the first place. Because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead? 06:48Remember, this is the country where electricity
comes from water in our rivers, heat from volcanoes, wind turbines, solar panels, biowaste. Abolishing fossil fuels means
disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars,
buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy. 07:20And transportation, let me tell you, has become an existential issue
for us Costa Ricans, because the model we have
is not working for us. It's hurting people, it's hurting companies, and it's hurting our health. 07:35Because when policies
and infrastructure fail, this is what happens on a daily basis. Two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. I don't understand why
we have to accept this as normal. It's offensive to have to waste our time like this
every single day. And this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see
in other countries where traffic is exploding. You know, Costa Ricans call this ""presa."" Presa means ""imprisoned."" And people are turning violent in a country that is otherwise
happy in pura vida. It's happening. So a lot is at stake. 08:24The good news is that when we talk
about clean transportation and different mobility, we're not talking about
some distant utopia out there. We're talking about electric mobility
that is happening today. By 2022, electric cars
and conventional cars are expected to cost the same, and cities are already trying
electric buses. And these really cool creatures are saving money, and they reduce pollution. So if we want to get rid
of oil-based transportation, we can, because we have options now
that we didn't have before. It's really exciting. 09:10But of course, some get very uncomfortable
with this idea, and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil,
and so is Costa Rica, so get real. That's what they tell you. And you know what the answer
to that argument is? That in 1948, we didn't say
the world is stuck with armies, so let's keep our army, too. No, we made a very brave choice, and that choice made the whole difference. 09:41So it's time for this generation
to be brave again and abolish fossil fuels for good. And I'll give you three reasons
why we have to do this. 09:51First, our model of transportation
and urbanization is broken, so this is the best moment
to redefine our urban and mobility future. We don't want cities
that are built for cars. We want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes. And we want public transportation, lots of it, public transportation
that is clean and dignifying. Because if we continue
adding fleets of conventional cars, our cities will become unbearable. 10:28Second, we have to change, but incremental change
is not going to be sufficient. We need transformational change. And there are some
incremental projects in my country, and I am the first one to celebrate them. But let's not kid ourselves. We're not talking about ending up
with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there while we keep investing
in the same kind of infrastructure, more cars, more roads, more oil. We're talking about
breaking free from oil, and you cannot get there
through incrementalism. 11:08Third, and you know this one, the world is hungry for inspiration. It craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues, especially in developing countries. So I believe Costa Rica
can be an inspiration to others, as we did last year when we disclosed that for so many days
we were not using any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity. The news went viral around the world. Also, and this makes me extremely proud, a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres, played a decisive role in the negotiations
of the Paris climate agreement. So we have to protect that legacy
and be an example. 12:07So what comes next? The people. How do we get people to own this? How do we get people to believe that it's possible to build a society without fossil fuels? A lot of work from
the ground up is needed. 12:29footnotefootnoteThat is why, in 2014,
we created Costa Rica Limpia. ""Limpia"" means ""clean,"" because we want to empower
and we want to inspire citizens. If citizens don't get engaged, clean transportation decisions
will be bogged down by endless, and I mean endless, technical discussions, and by avalanches of lobbying
by various established interests. Wanting to be a green country
powered by renewables is already part of our story. We should not let anybody
take that away from us. 13:12Last year, we brought people
from our seven provinces to talk about climate change
in terms that matter to them, and we also brought this year another group of Costa Ricans to talk about renewable energy. And you know what? These people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air. It brings people together. 13:38And the key to real participation is to help people not to feel small. People feel powerless, and they are tired of not being heard. So what we do is concrete things, and we translate technical issues
into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play
and can play it together. For the first time, we're tracking
the promises that were made on clean transportation, and politicos know
that they have to deliver it, but the tipping point will come
when we form coalitions -- citizens, companies, champions of public transportation -- that will make electric mobility
the new normal, especially in a developing country. 14:22By the time the next election comes, I believe every candidate
will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels. Because this question
has to enter our mainstream politics. And I'm telling you,
this is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda. It's about the country that we want and the cities that we have and the cities that we want and who makes that choice. Because at the end of the day,
what we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people, for Costa Ricans that are alive today and especially for those
who haven't been born. 15:09This is our National Museum today. It's bright and peaceful, and when you stand up in front of it, it's really hard to believe
these were military barracks at the end of the '40s. We started a new life
without an army in this place, and here is where our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day. And we will make history again. 15:35Thank you. 15:36(Applause)"
1,How small countries can make a big impact on climate change,Nicola Sturgeon,Nov 2021,"When it comes to tackling climate change, the size of a country doesn't matter -- it's their ambition that counts, says First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon. In a rousing talk, she shares examples of small nations -- from Bhutan and Fiji to her own Scotland -- whose leadership and climate action are galvanizing change on the international stage. (Followed by a brief Q&A with TED's global curator Bruno Giussani about the Cambo oil field project)", (50K),"Transcript (14 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtРусскийالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語FootnotesFootnotes00:00I’m going to start
today with a question. In other contexts,
perhaps, a risky question, not one you would expect
from somebody in my position in a talk about climate change. But it's important. Does size matter? 00:16(Laughter) 00:17My answer, perhaps also unexpected, is that no, it really, really doesn't. 00:24(Laughter) 00:25And Scotland -- 00:26(Applause) 00:28Scotland is proving that. About a mile from here,
in the National Museum of Scotland, you will find on display a steam engine
designed by the great engineer James Watt. A hundred miles from here,
just off the coast of Aberdeen, is the world's biggest floating wind farm. And then just a bit further north
from there, in the Pentland Firth, we find the biggest
wave power turbine being tested. These are all extraordinary feats
of technology and engineering, but they also demonstrate
how Scotland, a relatively small country, led the world into the Industrial Age and is now helping to power the world
into the Net-Zero Age. 01:18And there's a lesson for us in that. When we talk about
tackling climate change, we so often talk about the contributions
of America, Russia, China, Brazil, and that's important. We won't limit global warming
without these countries, but we also have to recognize that the ambition, the leadership
and the action of small countries matters too. 01:43Small countries have no time
for small objectives, and I really agree with that. And we see examples of the leadership that small countries show
everywhere we look. Take Bhutan. One million people or thereabouts
became the first in the world to commit to being
carbon-neutral for all time. Since then, 130 countries of all sizes
have followed suit. Or Fiji. In 2017, it hosted
the UN Climate Conference and did so much to highlight
the existential threat that climate change poses
to island nations. 02:22Now, a country like Scotland
with a rich industrial past has a special responsibility. We have disproportionately
contributed to climate change, so we must do more now
to help tackle climate change. 02:39So in recent years,
Scotland, this small country, has decarbonized faster
than any G20 country. We have just become -- 02:49(Applause) 02:54We have just become
the first nation in the world that is not an independent nation -- yet -- to publish -- 03:02(Laughter) 03:03(Applause) 03:04to publish an indicative, nationally
defined contribution showing how we will meet
the objectives of the Paris Agreement. So we've pledged to cut emissions
by three quarters by 2030 and to be net zero by 2045. 03:23We're also seeking to galvanize
change on the global stage. So we are currently
the cochair of a coalition that brings together 200 states, regions, devolved countries like ours to demonstrate leadership in meeting
the challenge of climate change. Now that coalition is not represented
formally at UN summits, we are not signatories to the treaties
that emerge from these summits. But collectively, we represent
two billion people across the world, and about half of the reduction
in global emissions that we need to see will depend on the actions we take. They will depend
on the legislation we pass, the infrastructure we build,
the investments we fund. 04:14So my point today is that,
yes, big countries matter, but the leadership
of small nations matters too. It's often states and regions
and small nations that can step in when the bigger countries fail to act. So when Trump disgracefully
took America out of the Paris Agreement, it was a coalition of states and cities
that kept the momentum going. And if we raise our ambition
and if we follow that through with action, then we can spark the bigger countries
to go further and faster, too. 04:48And there's one final point where
our voice and our contribution matters. So often it's states
or devolved nations like Scotland that have to respond most directly
to the impacts of climate change: heatwaves, floods, hurricanes. We have to deal with the implications. Now, for Scotland,
California and New South Wales that's difficult but manageable. For many others
across the world, it is not. So climate justice matters, too. It’s not enough to cut our own emissions,
although that is vital; we have to make sure we are helping those who have done the least
to cause climate change to do so too. And with the spirit
of justice and fairness absolutely at the heart of that. 05:35So to conclude, my message today is that countries of all shapes and sizes
must step up to this challenge. We cannot allow our size
to be something that we hide behind. When it comes to tackling climate change,
size really, really does not matter. We must think big in our ambition. We must act big in what we do, and we must be big
when it comes to the impact we make. 06:01Thank you very much. 06:02(Applause) 06:14Bruno Giussani: First Minister, thank you. I would like to ask a couple of questions because you mentioned
the wind farms up north, but there is a new field
opening up in the north, it is an oil field, the Cambo oil field. It’s been licensed
by the UK government, and a few weeks ago
you wrote to the prime minister of the UK government, and you asked him to reassess
that field and the licensing in view of the climate emergency. There's also a growing movement
in Scotland against that project. What are people to make
of opening up a new gigantic oil field while at the same time pushing
for decarbonizing policies at COP? 06:54Nicola Sturgeon: I think people are right
to ask big questions and be concerned. Oil and gas is important to Scotland. It has been for four, almost five decades
important to fulfilling our energy needs, but it's important to our economy. But if we're not prepared
to ask ourselves the hard questions, we're not really
facing up to this challenge. We can't switch
fossil fuels off overnight, but we must accelerate
the transition away from them. And therefore the question is:
Is new exploration consistent with that? And that's the question
I posed to the prime minister where the power over this lies. Yes, we need to make sure that we make
the transition sustainably and fairly. But if we just rely on new exploration
of the old ways of doing things, I think the question is whether we do that
at the pace we are required to do. So a country like Scotland,
we can't just answer the easy questions. We've got to face up
to the hard questions as well. But we must make sure
the transition is just -- just for people, for communities
and for the planet as a whole. And that's what we are
committed to seeking, to show leadership on. 08:00BG: What was your exact demand? Redraw the lines? Suspend it?
Change it? Reanalyze it? 08:05NS: Well, the license
was granted 20 years ago. There is a process
now it has to go through to get approval for development. And my argument is just if a company was now applying
for a new licence, there would have to be
a climate compatibility check. Now, arguably that's not robust enough, but the same thing should happen if our existing license
is turned into development consent. And that's the process
I think should happen. We've got to be careful that we don't leave communities
and people behind in that transition. We've got to be careful
we don't switch domestic production to imports of oil and gas. That would be counterproductive. So the way in which
we make the transition matters. But we can’t have a business as usual. Because if we keep telling ourselves
we can rely on fossil fuels forever, then we'll never meet that transition. And that's the key point
I think we've got to address. 08:59BG: Let's hope it goes in that direction. First Minister,
thank you for coming to TED. 09:03Thank you. 09:04(Applause)"
1,The case for optimism on climate change,Al Gore,Feb 2016,"Why is Al Gore optimistic about climate change? In this spirited talk, Gore asks three powerful questions about the man-made forces threatening to destroy our planet -- and the solutions we're designing to combat them. (Featuring Q&A with TED curator Chris Anderson)", (69K),"Transcript (27 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I was excited to be a part
of the ""Dream"" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off
the ""Nightmare?"" section of it. 00:08(Laughter) 00:11And certainly there are things
about the climate crisis that qualify. And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news. I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news. But -- hang on, because the answers
to the second and third questions really are very positive. 00:37So the first question is,
""Do we really have to change?"" And of course, the Apollo Mission,
among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern
environmental movement. 18 months after this Earthrise picture
was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized. And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space. And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists
have long told us. One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis
has to do with the sky. As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast
and limitless expanse that appears when we look up
from the ground. It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet. That right now is the open sewer
for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution
into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead. 01:46And there are many sources
of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going
to go through them all. I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved,
diet is involved, population is involved. Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost. But I'm going to focus
on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely
on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy
that our world burns every year. And you can see from this image
that after World War II, the emission rates
started really accelerating. And the accumulated amount
of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy
as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year. Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth. Now it's a big planet, but -- 02:47(Explosion sound) 02:49that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it
400,000 times per day. And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere,
the whole earth system. 03:01Let's look at the atmosphere. This is a depiction of what we used to think of as
the normal distribution of temperatures. The white represents
normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen. The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days. But the entire curve has moved
to the right in the 1980s. And you'll see
in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically
significant numbers of extremely hot days. In the 90s, the curve shifted further. And in the last 10 years,
you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous
than the cooler than average days. In fact, they are 150 times more common
on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago. 03:49So we're having
record-breaking temperatures. Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years
ever measured with instruments have been in this young century. The hottest of all was last year. Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average. And for the first time,
not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more
than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average. These higher temperatures
are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems. 04:23But on a global basis, 93 percent
of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans. And the scientists can measure
the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters. And this, too, is accelerating. It goes back more than a century. And more than half of the increase
has been in the last 19 years. This has consequences. 04:47The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger. Super Typhoon Haiyan
went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm
ever to make landfall. Pope Francis, who has made
such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that. Superstorm Sandy went over
areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into
New York and New Jersey. The second order of consequences
are affecting all of us right now. The warmer oceans are evaporating
much more water vapor into the skies. Average humidity worldwide
has gone up four percent. And it creates these atmospheric rivers. The Brazilian scientists
call them ""flying rivers."" And they funnel all of that
extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger
these massive record-breaking downpours. This is from Montana. Take a look at this storm last August. As it moves over Tucson, Arizona. It literally splashes off the city. These downpours are really unusual. 06:03Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days,
162 billion gallons. That represents more than two days
of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed. These record downpours are creating
historic floods and mudslides. 06:20This one is from Chile last year. And you'll see that warehouse going by. There are oil tankers cars going by. This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running
of the cars and trucks, I guess. Every night on the TV news now
is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. 06:42(Laughter) 06:44I mean, really. 06:47The insurance industry
has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up. They're not under any illusions
about what's happening. And the causality requires
a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause
and linear effect -- one cause, one effect. This is systemic causation. As the great Kevin Trenberth says, ""All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy
in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now."" So, the same extra heat pulls
the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer,
more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now. 07:30It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires
in the western part of North America. There's certainly been evidence
of that, a lot of them. 07:39More lightning, as the heat energy builds up,
there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also. 07:46These climate-related disasters also have
geopolitical consequences and create instability. The climate-related historic drought
that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent
of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1.5 million climate refugees
into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another
1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War. And along with other factors,
that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now. The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees,
food and water shortages and pandemic disease. 08:34Right now we're seeing microbial diseases
from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had
a lot to do with this. But the changing conditions
change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases
can become endemic and change the range of the vectors,
like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. The Zika epidemic now -- we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool
and we have a better public health system. But when women in some regions
of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant
for two years -- that's something new,
that ought to get our attention. The Lancet, one of the two greatest
medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this
a medical emergency now. And there are many factors because of it. 09:28This is also connected
to the extinction crisis. We're in danger of losing 50 percent
of all the living species on earth by the end of this century. And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day. 09:44Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm
that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long,
dark, winter, polar night. And when the land-based ice
of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level. 10:10Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph
from Svalbard illustrates this. It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica. The 10 largest risk cities
for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia. When you measure it by assets at risk,
number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk. Number three: New York and Newark. I was in Miami last fall
during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days. And there were fish from the ocean
swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey. And this happens regularly
during the highest-tide tides now. Not with rain -- they call it
""sunny-day flooding."" It comes up through the storm sewers. And the Mayor of Miami
speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed
through a partisan lens. This is a crisis
that's getting worse day by day. We have to move beyond partisanship. 11:11And I want to take a moment
to honor these House Republicans -- 11:15(Applause) 11:16who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth
about the climate crisis. 11:26So the cost of the climate
crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects
I haven't even mentioned. It's an enormous burden. I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum
last month in Davos, after their annual survey
of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now
the number one risk to the global economy. So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head
of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority
of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened
with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing. If you look at all of the carbon fuels
that were burned since the beginning
of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned
in the last 16 years. Here are all the ones that are proven
and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars. The International Energy Agency
says only this amount can be burned. So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- unburnable. Risk to the global economy. That's why divestment movement
makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative. 12:35So the answer to the first question,
""Must we change?"" is yes, we have to change. Second question, ""Can we change?"" This is the exciting news! The best projections
in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world
would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark
by 14 and a half times over. We see an exponential curve
for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries -- take Germany,
an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different
from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy
from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting
more than half on an average basis. 13:24More good news: energy storage,
from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been
coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar, the news is even
more exciting! The best projections 14 years ago
were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010. When 2010 came around,
we beat that mark by 17 times over. Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. This year, we're on track
to beat it 68 times over. 13:55We're going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar
is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence
of these exponential curves. 14:13(Applause) 14:16And the cost has come down
10 percent per year for 30 years. And it's continuing to come down. 14:24Now, the business community
has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing
the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates
are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood
as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity
is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit
like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius. It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water. And it's the difference between markets
that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital
into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest
new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it
is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion
of new investment. Starting in 2010, investments globally
in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future
are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy
is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables. And by the way, if you add
the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume
that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer
and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically. 15:49So is there any precedent
for such a rapid adoption of a new technology? Well, there are many,
but let's look at cell phones. In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do
a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones
that appeared then. ""How many can we sell
by the year 2000?"" they asked. McKinsey came back and said, ""900,000."" And sure enough,
when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 --
in the first three days. And for the balance of the year,
they sold 120 times more. And now there are more cell connections
than there are people in the world. 16:25So, why were they not only wrong,
but way wrong? I've asked that question myself, ""Why?"" 16:32(Laughter) 16:33And I think the answer is in three parts. First, the cost came down much faster
than anybody expected, even as the quality went up. And low-income countries, places
that did not have a landline grid -- they leap-frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been
in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids
in the developing world? Well, not so hot. And in many areas, they don't exist. There are more people
without any electricity at all in India than the entire population
of the United States of America. So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models
that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed
this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying
country in the world: two systems per minute
on average, night and day. And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun
comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's
energy needs for an entire year. It's actually a little bit
less than an hour. So the answer to the second question,
""Can we change?"" is clearly ""Yes."" And it's an ever-firmer ""yes."" 17:43Last question, ""Will we change?"" Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot. But nations aren't waiting,
they're going ahead. China has already announced
that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide
cap and trade system. They will likely link up
with the European Union. The United States
has already been changing. All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled. All of these existing
coal plants were retired. All of these coal plants have had
their retirement announced. All of them -- canceled. We are moving forward. Last year -- if you look at
all of the investment in new electricity generation
in the United States, almost three-quarters
was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar. 18:30We are solving this crisis. The only question is:
how long will it take to get there? So, it matters that a lot
of people are organizing to insist on this change. Almost 400,000 people
marched in New York City before the UN special session on this. Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world. And so, I am extremely optimistic. As I said before,
we are going to win this. 19:03I'll finish with this story. When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon
and bring him back safely in 10 years. And I heard adults
of that day and time say, ""That's reckless, expensive,
may well fail."" But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong
set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up
in NASA's mission control in Houston. Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room
that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard
that challenge, was 18. 19:45We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others
that we have faced. One of the greatest poets
of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: ""After the final 'no,'
there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes',
the future world depends."" When the abolitionists
started their movement, they met with no after no after no. And then came a yes. The Women's Suffrage
and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally,
there was a yes. The Civil Rights Movement,
the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement
for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere. After the final ""no"" comes a ""yes."" 20:27When any great moral challenge
is ultimately resolved into a binary choice
between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained
because of who we are as human beings. Ninety-nine percent of us,
that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this. We have everything we need. Some still doubt that we have
the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself
a renewable resource. 20:57Thank you very much. 20:58(Applause) 21:35Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible
combination of skills. You've got this scientist mind
that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it
into the most vivid language. No one else can do that,
that's why you led this thing. It was amazing to see it 10 years ago,
it was amazing to see it now. 21:53Al Gore: Well, you're nice
to say that, Chris. But honestly, I have a lot
of really good friends in the scientific community
who are incredibly patient and who will sit there
and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it
into simple enough language that I can understand it. And that's the key to trying
to communicate. 22:15CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful. How do we know that all those graphs,
all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed
in the first part? 22:29AG: I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been
in the business world for 15 years. But one of the things I've learned
is that apparently it matters if a new product or service
is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than. Turns out, it makes a difference
if it's cheaper than. 22:47(Laughter) 22:48And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change. We are regularly surprised
by these developments. The late Rudi Dornbusch,
the great economist said, ""Things take longer to happen
then you think they will, and then they happen much faster
than you thought they could."" I really think that's where we are. Some people are using the phrase
""The Solar Singularity"" now, meaning when it gets
below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice. 23:17Now, in one of the presentations
yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use
regulations to slow this down. And I just don't think it's going to work. 23:32There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman
of the Atlanta Tea Party. They enlisted her
in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations. And she had just put
solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request. 23:45(Laughter) 23:47And so she went and formed
an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization
called the Green Tea Party. 23:54(Laughter) 23:55(Applause) 23:56And they defeated the proposal. So, finally, the answer
to your question is, this sounds a little corny
and maybe it's a cliché, but 10 years ago -- and Christiana
referred to this -- there are people in this audience
who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves. And it didn't work out economically
for some of them, but it kick-started
this global revolution. And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge
that we are going to win this. But it matters a lot how fast we win it. 24:33CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful. If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer
a partisan issue, but you bring along people
from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds
of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day -- boy, that's really exciting. 24:55Thank you so much. 24:56AG: Thank you so much
for bringing me back to TED. Thank you! 25:00(Applause)"

I look at the chemistry
of the ocean today. I look at the chemistry
of the ocean in the past. The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains
of deepwater corals. You can see an image of one
of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to Antarctica,
thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different
than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see
if you've had a tropical holiday. 00:25So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the ocean. Two dimensions, such as this
beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface temperature. This was taken using satellite,
so it's got tremendous spatial resolution. The overall features are extremely
easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm
because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold
because there's less sunlight. And that allows big icecaps
to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere. If you plunge deep into the sea,
or even put your toes in the sea, you know it gets colder as you go down, and that's mostly because the deep waters
that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions
where the waters are dense. 01:07If we travel back in time
20,000 years ago, the earth looked very much different. And I've just given you a cartoon version
of one of the major differences you would have seen
if you went back that long. The icecaps were much bigger. They covered lots of the continent,
and they extended out over the ocean. Sea level was 120 meters lower. Carbon dioxide [levels] were very
much lower than they are today. So the earth was probably about three
to five degrees colder overall, and much, much colder
in the polar regions. 01:37What I'm trying to understand, and what other colleagues of mine
are trying to understand, is how we moved from that
cold climate condition to the warm climate condition
that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the transition from these
cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict
from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores,
because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice,
and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue-white layers. Gases are trapped in the ice cores,
so we can measure CO2 -- that's why we know CO2
was lower in the past -- and the chemistry of the ice
also tells us about temperature in the polar regions. And if you move in time
from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased. It didn't increase smoothly. Sometimes it increased very rapidly, then there was a plateau, then it increased rapidly. It was different in the two polar regions, and CO2 also increased in jumps. 02:34So we're pretty sure the ocean
has a lot to do with this. The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more
than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat
across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients
and it controls primary productivity. 02:50So if we want to find out
what's going on down in the deep sea, we really need to get down there, see what's there and start to explore. This is some spectacular footage
coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep
in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land. You're amongst the first people
to see this bit of the seafloor, along with my research team. You're probably seeing new species. We don't know. You'd have to collect the samples
and do some very intense taxonomy. You can see beautiful bubblegum corals. There are brittle stars
growing on these corals. Those are things that look
like tentacles coming out of corals. There are corals made of different forms
of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this
massive undersea mountain, and the dark sort of stuff,
those are fossilized corals, and we're going to talk
a little more about those as we travel back in time. 03:39To do that, we need
to charter a research boat. This is the James Cook,
an ocean-class research vessel moored up in Tenerife. Looks beautiful, right? Great, if you're not a great mariner. Sometimes it looks
a little more like this. This is us trying to make sure
that we don't lose precious samples. Everyone's scurrying around,
and I get terribly seasick, so it's not always a lot of fun,
but overall it is. 04:01So we've got to become
a really good mapper to do this. You don't see that kind of spectacular
coral abundance everywhere. It is global and it is deep, but we need to really find
the right places. We just saw a global map,
and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. This was a seven-week cruise, and this is us, having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers
of the seafloor in seven weeks, but that's only a tiny fraction
of the seafloor. We're traveling from west to east, over part of the ocean that would
look featureless on a big-scale map, but actually some of these mountains
are as big as Everest. So with the maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas
to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much. To do that, we need to fly
remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. And if we do that, we can get maps
that are one-meter resolution down thousands of meters. Here is a remotely-operated vehicle, a research-grade vehicle. You can see an array
of big lights on the top. There are high-definition cameras,
manipulator arms, and lots of little boxes and things
to put your samples. 05:09Here we are on our first dive
of this particular cruise, plunging down into the ocean. We go pretty fast to make sure
the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships. And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see. These are deep sea sponges, meter scale. This is a swimming holothurian --
it's a small sea slug, basically. This is slowed down. Most of the footage I'm showing
you is speeded up, because all of this takes a lot of time. This is a beautiful holothurian as well. And this animal you're going to see
coming up was a big surprise. I've never seen anything like this
and it took us all a bit surprised. This was after about 15 hours of work
and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant
sea monster started rolling past. It's called a pyrosome
or colonial tunicate, if you like. This wasn't what we were looking for. We were looking for corals,
deep sea corals. You're going to see a picture
of one in a moment. It's small, about five centimeters high. It's made of calcium carbonate,
so you can see its tentacles there, moving in the ocean currents. An organism like this probably lives
for about a hundred years. And as it grows, it takes in
chemicals from the ocean. And the chemicals,
or the amount of chemicals, depends on the temperature;
it depends on the pH, it depends on the nutrients. And if we can understand how
these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back,
collect fossil specimens, and reconstruct what the ocean
used to look like in the past. And here you can see us collecting
that coral with a vacuum system, and we put it into a sampling container. We can do this very
carefully, I should add. 06:43Some of these organisms live even longer. This is a black coral called Leiopathes,
an image taken by my colleague, Brendan Roark, about 500
meters below Hawaii. Four thousand years is a long time. If you take a branch from one
of these corals and polish it up, this is about 100 microns across. And Brendan took some analyses
across this coral -- you can see the marks -- and he's been able to show
that these are actual annual bands, so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean, corals can record seasonal changes, which is pretty spectacular. 07:14But 4,000 years is not enough to get
us back to our last glacial maximum. So what do we do? We go in for these fossil specimens. This is what makes me really unpopular
with my research team. So going along, there's giant sharks everywhere, there are pyrosomes,
there are swimming holothurians, there's giant sponges, but I make everyone go down
to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling
around on the seafloor. And we pick up all these corals,
bring them back, we sort them out. But each one of these is a different age, and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure
those chemical signals, this helps us to find out what's been going on
in the ocean in the past. 07:52So on the left-hand image here, I've taken a slice through a coral,
polished it very carefully and taken an optical image. On the right-hand side, we've taken that same piece of coral,
put it in a nuclear reactor, induced fission, and every time there's some decay, you can see that marked out in the coral, so we can see the uranium distribution. Why are we doing this? Uranium is a very poorly regarded element, but I love it. The decay helps us find out
about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. And if you remember from the beginning, that's what we want to get at
when we're thinking about climate. So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products,
thorium, in these corals, and that tells us exactly
how old the fossils are. 08:32This beautiful animation
of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate
how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient
ocean feedbacks. You can see the density
of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey. It's just one year of data, but you can see how dynamic
the Southern Ocean is. The intense mixing,
particularly the Drake Passage, which is shown by the box, is really one of the strongest
currents in the world coming through here,
flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed, because it's moving over those
great big undersea mountains, and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange
with the atmosphere in and out. And essentially, the oceans are breathing
through the Southern Ocean. We've collected corals from back and forth
across this Antarctic passage, and we've found quite a surprising thing
from my uranium dating: the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial
to the interglacial. We don't really know why, but we think it's something
to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water. 09:37So here we are. I'm going to illustrate what I think
we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean. We went up and down sea mountains.
We collected little fossil corals. This is my illustration of that. We think back in the glacial, from the analysis
we've made in the corals, that the deep part of the Southern Ocean
was very rich in carbon, and there was a low-density
layer sitting on top. That stops carbon dioxide
coming out of the ocean. We then found corals
that are of an intermediate age, and they show us that the ocean mixed
partway through that climate transition. That allows carbon to come
out of the deep ocean. And then if we analyze corals
closer to the modern day, or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals, we see that we move to a position
where carbon can exchange in and out. So this is the way
we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment. 10:29So I want to leave you
with this last slide. It's just a still taken out of that first
piece of footage that I showed you. This is a spectacular coral garden. We didn't even expect
to find things this beautiful. It's thousands of meters deep. There are new species. It's just a beautiful place. There are fossils in amongst, and now I've trained you
to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there. 10:51So next time you're lucky enough
to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean, just think -- there are massive
sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before, and there are beautiful corals. 11:02Thank you. 11:03(Applause)"
1,How we can curb climate change by spending two percent more on everything,Jens Burchardt,Apr 2021,"Would you pay two percent more for the carbon-neutral version of the products you buy and use every day? In this innovative talk, climate pathfinder Jens Burchardt walks us through the costs and considerations of producing planet-friendly products -- from creation to purchase -- and explains why curbing climate change doesn't have to break the bank. It's an inspiring demonstration of how the barriers to a greener world may not be as insurmountable as we think.", (39K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalРусскийالعربيةFootnotesFootnotes00:01This is a lump of coal. It was mined a while ago
in the Ruhr region in Germany, about 50 miles from where I grew up. As coal goes,
it's actually quite high-end. It's very dry, it has
a high share of carbon in it. Both those things mean
you can't only burn it to produce power and heat, but you can use it to make steel. Now why am I telling you this? By the end of this talk, I want to have convinced you
that we can make a huge step forward in the great fight against climate change by just spending one to two percent more
on things that we buy. And the path of this coal
is going to help me with it. 00:36footnotefootnoteBut ... back to steel. What you have to know about steelmaking
is that it's a humblingly brutal process. These huge furnaces that tear apart
and recombine elements and materials that have literally been around
for millions of years, at temperatures of up to
more than 2,000 degrees Celsius. It's a triumph of industrialization, but it's terrible for the climate. More than five percent
of all man-made emissions currently come from making steel. And of all the many challenges
we face to save the climate, this one's particularly hard to solve. Now, why is that? 01:13The first reason is technical. There are technologies
to produce low-carbon steel. We can, for example, capture the CO2 and pump it back under the earth -- that's called carbon capture and storage. Or we can move to entirely new processes that, for example, run on low-carbon
hydrogen instead of coal. But all of these are currently
only at a piloting stage. 01:31footnotefootnoteThe second reason is economical. This is likely going to be expensive. And to illustrate that, let's compare the steel challenge
to that of companies in other sectors. If you're in, say, manufacturing, most of your emissions
come from the power you consume for things like conveyor belts,
robots, drives and so on. You can eliminate them
by switching to renewables, which isn't that expensive anymore. In most cases, this won’t cost you
more than 10 euros per ton of CO2, probably a lot less. Other companies have
more energy-intensive processes that require a lot of heat to operate. They generate more emissions
by burning fossil fuels directly, and that's more expensive to get rid of. 02:12footnotefootnoteNow let's assume,
across all of their processes, it costs them, on average,
five times as much, somewhere between
40 and 50 euros per ton of CO2. Now if a steel company
wants to move to zero emissions, it either needs to invest significantly
in upgrading all of its current plants and into infrastructure
that transports CO2 from its plants to a storage site, or it needs to close all its plants
and build entirely new ones that, for example,
run on low-carbon hydrogen. According to industry studies,
this can cost them 10 times as much, in the ballpark of 100 euros
per ton of CO2, and the costs for a ton of steel
could increase by as much as 50 percent. 02:53Now, to make matters even worse, our steel company operates
in the commodity business; it almost exclusively competes on price. And it has shitty margins already: that means saving CO2 is expensive, but its profit per ton
of CO2 is very low, and this puts it
in the uncomfortable company of only a few other sectors, the so-called hard-to-abate sectors club, all the industries
like cement and chemicals, that have equally messy
industrial processes and require very high
temperatures to operate, or aviation and shipping, that need to invest a lot of energy to move very large and heavy objects
over longer distances. 03:27And hard-to-abate sectors
are one of the larger dilemmas of international climate action, because discussions around decarbonization
usually go roughly like this: Well, the activist says, ""Your emissions are harming the planet
and threatening humanity. You need to change immediately."" And the company answers, ""I know. But if I invest
in low-carbon technologies, and the next guy doesn't, we'll be more expensive
and go out of business. It won't help the climate. So first, I need a level playing field."" Both understandable positions, but bringing down emissions
is kind of urgent, and a global level playing field, in which, say, all countries agree on one
mutual price for carbon emissions, probably won't materialize
anymore in my lifetime. 04:10So this is where the discussions
usually reach a stalemate, and where my talk would therefore end. But would it end here,
I wouldn’t have been invited to hold it, and I already promised you that saving the planet
does not have to break the bank. So let's maybe follow
the path of our lump of coal just a little further. 04:28The last time we left it,
it had helped make steel, which, climate impact notwithstanding, is one of the key building blocks
of our economies. It's in many, many things, from huge structures
to everyday household items like refrigerators or washing machines. We use it to build wind turbines, which we need to save emissions
in the power sector, and we use it to build our cars, which is the part of the journey
I'd like us to follow next. 04:54Now, in today's typical car, steel can be found
in many, many different parts. You can assume that an average
European midsized sedan with a 30,000 euro price tag contains about one ton of it. To produce one ton of steel, in Europe, generates a bit less
than two tons of carbon emissions. In other countries, like China,
it's a bit more, so let's round to two. Now we've learned earlier that moving to low-carbon steel
can increase its costs by as much as 50 percent. If history tells us anything, then these costs will likely decrease
over the long run, if humans truly put their mind,
their muscle, their money behind it. But, for the sake of this argument,
let's stick to these costs, plus 50 percent. In the case of our European midsize sedan,
this translates into ... wait for it ... 200 euros. 05:48footnotefootnoteWait, that can't be right. That's not even a percent
of the final sales value. Well, let's do the math. If you spend 30,000 euros for a car,
what are you actually paying for? Well, first of all, the car company
needs to make money. So the first 20 percent
are for its margin, for marketing, the whole sales organization,
overhead and so on. The car needs to be assembled -- another 20 percent goes to production. First, the parts of the car
have to be assembled -- 40 percent go to suppliers. In this whole process, many things need to be moved
from A to B and back, so more goes to transportation. Now only 15 percent
of the price of the car is actually for the materials in it. Things like the battery, aluminum,
plastics, glass, and two percent for the steel. This means that materials that make up 90 percent
of a car's emission footprint by the time that I can buy it
in the dealership make up only 15 percent of its costs. And it means that even [though]
the car company has to pay 50 percent more for the steel in the car, this only translates
into a very small markup on my final sales price. 06:55Now you would rightly argue
that steel isn't the only thing creating emissions in the car. And that's, of course, correct. So we did the math for other commodities
and processes as well. And it turns out building
a 30,000 euro car out of exclusively
carbon-neutral materials would only increase its price
to 30,500 euros, only 500 euros extra. It's less than two percent more. Buying that same car
in sunset red instead of black would cost me 700 euros extra. Fancier rims -- 1,000 euros extra. Leather seats -- 2,000 euros extra. You get the picture. 07:32So let's imagine: that same discussion we had earlier,
but with a car producer in the middle, where the activist says, ""Your emissions are harming the planet
and threatening humanity. You need to change immediately."" And now a car producer answers, ""I know. But if I invest in low-carbon materials,
and the next guy doesn't, my car will be two percent more expensive. Wait ... My customers might actually pay that. And I can market all my cars
as carbon-neutral. Steel producer, your steel is creating
too many emissions in my car. You have to change immediately."" ""I can make low-carbon steel for you, but it will be more expensive."" ""How much more expensive?"" And now, we at least have a dialog. 08:15footnotefootnoteAlmost everything about the way
we currently live currently contributes to global warming. Most of the things we buy
come with a heavy emissions backpack that few of us are really aware of. What I want you to understand is that we can eliminate
a lot of these emissions by just spending one to two percent more
on things that we buy. We've learned what it would cost
to produce a carbon-neutral car. So how about a carbon-neutral smartphone? Three euros extra. That's 13 cents a month
on a two-year plan. A carbon-neutral pair of jeans?
60 to 70 cents extra. Even building a house
out of carbon-neutral materials would only increase its costs
by two to three percent, and even less in good locations. 08:58There are six supply chains that are responsible for almost half
of all global emissions that we can impact directly
through our purchasing decisions. Those are things like food,
construction, fashion, consumer goods, electronics
and, of course, automotive. And just like in the car example, materials make up only a fraction
of the final sales price in most of them. Addressing these emissions
could be a huge step forward for international climate action. It would enable customer-facing companies that can benefit from marketing
carbon-neutral products to address a multiple
of their direct emissions footprints. 09:34And many of these emissions
are in sectors like steel, that can shoulder the costs on their own. Some are in countries that don’t yet 
regulate emissions aggressively enough. Take the Chucks I’m wearing now. Me being willing to spend
two percent more on them could have reduced
the production emissions in China. Now I'm well aware
that not everyone can easily afford to spend these two percent extra, but we have to be aware
that the economic consequences, let alone the human ones, of not spending this money, would be far, far worse. We have to move to net zero. Fairly distributing the costs of this is one of the many challenges that we as a society
will need to deal with. 10:13I'm also not saying
that this will be easy. Understanding supply-chain emissions
is unbelievably cumbersome. Engaging with suppliers to address them
takes a lot of effort. What we would argue
is that, for many companies, the chance to market
a truly carbon-neutral product at just a one-to-two percent higher price should be well worth this effort. Just imagine: you're standing in a store, with two brands of the same
product in front of you. One is carbon-neutral --
it costs two percent more. Which of these two products
would you rather buy? Imagine you had the chance to work for either one
of these two companies. Who would you rather work for? Imagine you were an investor. On which of these two companies
would you bet your money? Which of these two do you think
will be more successful in the long run? To solve the climate crisis,
there's still a lot we need to figure out. There are many challenges
we need to overcome. But economics
don't have to be one of them. 11:18Thank you."
1,A bold plan to protect 30 percent of the Earth's surface and ocean floor,Enric Sala,Nov 2021,"As a diver in the 1970s, marine ecologist Enric Sala saw once-lush oceanscapes reduced to underwater deserts -- but later, in marine preserves across the globe, he also witnessed the ocean's power to rejuvenate itself when left to its own natural devices. Could rewilding the planet help us restore biodiversity and reduce the impacts of climate change? Sala presents the 30x30 initiative: a global plan to protect 30 percent of the Earth's surface and the ocean floor by 2030.", (44K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)00:00When I was a kid growing up
in the Mediterranean, I was fascinated by the underwater world that Jacques Cousteau showed us on TV. When he started filming in the mid-1940s, the Mediterranean shores
were still full of large fish. But when I went to the sea
to swim in the '70s, I saw none of that. There were sea urchins on a barren bottom, but I never saw a large fish. The industrialization of fishing
after the World War II put the latest nail in the coffin
of Mediterranean marine life. 00:34I thought nature was lost. Until I started scuba diving in the Medes Islands
marine reserve in Spain. One square kilometer fully protected from fishing
and other damaging activities. I still remember
that first dive in the reserve. As soon as I put my head underwater, I felt like diving
into one of Cousteau's films. What was missing from the sea
of my childhood was there. Groupers, sea bass, octopus,
scorpion fish, seaweed forests. Just a few years of protection
had allowed the sea to bounce back. I have seen this miracle happen in other
areas across the ocean, like in Cabo Pulmo, Mexico, where local fishermen were so upset
with not having enough fish to catch, that in the mid-'90s, they asked the Mexican government
to create a no-take area. A national park in the sea. We surveyed the marine environment then, and the place was an underwater desert. When we returned a decade later, everything had changed. What had been a barren sea
was now a kaleidoscope of life and color. We saw it come back to pristine
in only 10 years, including the return of the large fish
like groupers, jacks and sharks. And those visionary fishermen
are better off now. From diving tourism inside the reserve
and better fishing around it. 02:12But today, globally, only seven percent of the ocean and less than a fifth of our land
have been protected. That means that we have converted
most of our planet into a tame environment, where 96 percent of the mass
of the mammals is us and our domesticated livestock. Only four percent is everything else, from pandas to tigers to elephants. And we have removed over 90 percent
of the large fish in the ocean in the last century alone. On top of the loss of nature, we have global warming. The summer of 2021 has seen some of the hottest temperatures
in human history, in places that one
would expect to be cool, like Canada, Finland and Siberia. This extreme heat kills hundreds
of thousands of people. It fuels raging wildfires, turning towns, forests
and grasslands into ashes, also killing billions
of individual animals and trees and many coral reefs around the world. 03:24No place is safe anymore unless we rewild our planet. If we are to prevent a global disaster,
we need to do two things. As we know, we need to reduce emissions
of greenhouse gases to almost zero. But we also need to draw down
the excess carbon pollution in the atmosphere and in the ocean. How can we do that? 03:52To capture the excess of greenhouse gases,
we need nature's help. Because trees, grasslands, peatlands, mangroves, kelp forests and healthy oceans are the best
and most efficient technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and they already exist. As long as we protect them, they do the removal for free. The more biodiversity there is, the more carbon pollution it can absorb, the more it can help
stabilize the climate. And biodiversity also gives us
clean air and water, food and protection from floods,
storms and even wildfires. 04:43The problem is that nature
cannot keep up with us. The biodiversity that is left today is not enough to absorb
our impacts any longer. That's why in 2018, I put together a team
of top scientists and economists to answer the question of which areas
in the ocean we must protect first. And how much of the ocean
do we need to protect? We decided to focus on three objectives: biodiversity, food and carbon storage to help
mitigate climate change. If we think of each
objective in isolation, there are tradeoffs. Protecting the top areas for biodiversity could result in a loss
of fishing catch, for example. To solve that problem, we developed a new framework
to optimize multiple benefits. Picking which areas to protect depends on how much we value
the different objectives. We found that if we gave the same weight
to each biodiversity, food and carbon, we would want to protect
the right 45 percent of the ocean to maximize the three benefits. We also found that even
if we didn't value biodiversity, the minimum amount of ocean
we would protect would be 30 percent. So 30 percent of the ocean is the floor, the minimum area that we need to protect
if we want to preserve marine life and all the benefits
it provides for people. Similar analysis has been
done for the land, also showing 30 percent as a minimum. Armed with this research, we at National Geographic partnered
with the Wyss Campaign for Nature, and launched a campaign for ""30 by 30,"" meaning at least 30 percent of the planet, land and sea, protected by 2030. Working with the governments
of Costa Rica, France and the United Kingdom, we built the High Ambition Coalition
for Nature and People, which now has 66 countries
in it and growing, all supporting ""30 by 30"" as a main target
for a global deal on nature. 06:55Thirty percent of our planet by 2030. Only that amount of wild nature, together with a massive reduction
in carbon emissions, will be able to get us back on track. 07:07And of course, we need to manage our activities
more responsibly everywhere else. ""30 by 30"" will involve
a combination of strategies. From national parks
and marine protected areas, to lands managed by Indigenous peoples
and local communities, which have been effective
in preventing habitat loss, often more effectively
than conventional conservation methods. Expanding recognition of the land rights
of Indigenous peoples is an effective and moral solution for protecting our world. And protecting the land can be done only together
with the people living on it, like Canada is doing with its Indigenous,
Protected and Conserved Areas. 07:50Some will say, however, that we cannot afford
to protect our natural world. Well, let's look at the numbers. A study has put the cost
of protecting 30 percent of the planet at about 140 billion dollars a year. That's only a fraction of the money that governments use
to subsidize industries that pollute our air, waste our soil
and empty our ocean. We need to reverse the flow of that money from funding the destruction
of our life support system to preserving it. The solution to the problem
we have created has been here all along. I understand that the idea of protecting
a third of our land and ocean may feel threatening to those who see only the short-term profits
of their destruction. But I am hopeful because I have seen with my own eyes
how nature can recover in those marine reserves. And I have seen how the return of nature has helped people thrive
and build a better life. We just need to give nature
the space it needs so she can continue providing for us. 09:01Thank you."
1,Why bees are disappearing,Marla Spivak,Sep 2013,"Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years, each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony. So why, seven years ago, did colonies start dying en masse? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world's crops. Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us?", (95K),"Transcript (34 Languages)CatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάБеларуская моваРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00This is our life with bees, and this is our life without bees. Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals. More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. 00:22But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. They're out there because they need to eat. Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. They're flower-feeders, and as they move from flower to flower, basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart, they end up providing this valuable pollination service. In parts of the world where there are no bees, or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush. Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon. Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator. Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter) Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it. So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it, and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it, and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh, and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body, and she takes it home as food. Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. 02:10So there's other, maybe more personal reasons, to care about bees. There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world, and they're absolutely gorgeous. These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. 02:34Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world. Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history, mostly to harvest their honey, which is an amazing natural sweetener. 02:55I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke. I was 18 years old and bored, and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it. I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. It was like the best of science fiction come true. And even stranger, there were these people, these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family, and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself. So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper, a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico. And I was permanently hooked. 03:34Honeybees can be considered a super-organism, where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms. Now this society has no central authority. Nobody's in charge. So how they come to collective decisions, and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor, how they communicate where the flowers are, all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing. My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years, is their system of healthcare. So bees have social healthcare. So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy. For example, we study hygiene, where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest, from the colony, and it keeps the colony healthy. And more recently, we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants. So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very, very sticky resins off the leaves, and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis. We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. It's a natural antibiotic. It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony, and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine, but we didn't know how good it was for the bees. So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years. 05:25So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse, first in the United States, it was clear that there was something really, really wrong. In our collective conscience, in a really primal way, we know we can't afford to lose bees. So what's going on? Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes, and I'll go through each of these. The bottom line is, bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. 06:01Now we have the best data on honeybees, so I'll use them as an example. In the United States, bees in fact have been in decline since World War II. We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to 1945. We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think. And the reason is, after World War II, we changed our farming practices. We stopped planting cover crops. We stopped planting clover and alfalfa, which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil, and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. And after World War II, we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. Now we talk about food deserts, places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts, dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans. Since World War II, we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival. And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees, like almonds. Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies, hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination, and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. Now, the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees, over 1.5 million hives of bees, be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop. And they're trucked in in semi-loads, and they must be trucked out, because after bloom, the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape. 08:19Bees have been dying over the last 50 years, and we're planting more crops that need them. There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. 08:33And then there's pesticides. After World War II, we started using pesticides on a large scale, and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests. Recently, researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food, and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it, and this includes every class of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient. This small bee is holding up a large mirror. How much is it going to take to contaminate humans? 09:34One of these class of insecticides, the neonicontinoids, is making headlines around the world right now. You've probably heard about it. This is a new class of insecticides. It moves through the plant so that a crop pest, a leaf-eating insect, would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die. If one of these neonics, we call them, is applied in a high concentration, such as in this ground application, enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar, where a bee can consume, in this case, a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die. In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms, it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide, and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar, and if a bee consumes this lower dose, either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home. And on top of everything else, bees have their own set of diseases and parasites. Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. It's called varroa destructor. It's aptly named. It's this big, blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses. 10:57Let me put this all together for you. I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it, and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus, but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu, and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition. But what if I lived in a food desert? And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store, and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed, in my food, enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin, that I couldn't find my way home? And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death. 11:44And it's not just our honeybees. All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees. These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees. We need all of our bees. 12:03So what are we going to do? What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created? It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful. Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways. Plant bee-friendly flowers, and don't contaminate these flowers, this bee food, with pesticides. So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them. Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns, in your boulevards. Campaign to have them planted in public gardens, community spaces, meadows. Set aside farmland. We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season, from spring to fall. We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees, but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees. And we need to diversify our farms. We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. 13:33So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers -- but when bees have access to good nutrition, we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. And when bees have access to good nutrition, they're better able to engage their own natural defenses, their healthcare, that they have relied on for millions of years. So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me, is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society, where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution, an emergent property, that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions. So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change. 14:38On behalf of the bees, thank you. 14:41(Applause) 14:45Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question. The latest numbers on the die-off of bees, is there any sign of things bottoming out? What's your hope/depression level on this? 14:57Maria Spivak: Yeah. At least in the United States, an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter. About 20 years ago, we were at a 15-percent loss. So it's getting precarious. 15:10CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --
MS: Yes, thirty percent a year. 15:13CA: Thirty percent a year.
MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number, they can recuperate some of their loss. 15:22We're kind of at a tipping point. We can't really afford to lose that many more. We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. 15:31CA: Thank you. 15:32(Applause)"

did something unusual. He held his cabinet meeting underwater. He literally took his ministers
scuba diving, as it were, to warn the world
that his country could drown unless we control global warming. 00:31Now I don't know whether he got
his message across to the world or not, but he certainly caught mine. I saw a political stunt. You see, I'm a politician, and I notice these things. And let's be honest, the Maldives are distant
from where I come from -- my country is Bhutan -- so I didn't lose any sleep
over their impending fate. 00:57footnotefootnoteBarely two months later,
I saw another political stunt. This time, the prime minister of Nepal, he held his cabinet meeting
on Mount Everest. He took all his ministers all the way up
to the base camp of Everest to warn the world that the Himalayan glaciers were melting. Now did that worry me? You bet it did. I live in the Himalayas. But did I lose any sleep over his message? No. I wasn't ready to let a political stunt
interfere with my beauty sleep. 01:38(Laughter) 01:40footnotefootnoteNow fast-forward 10 years. In February this year, I saw this report. This here report basically concludes that one-third of the ice
on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains could melt by the end of the century. But that's only if, if we are able to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade
over preindustrial levels. Otherwise, if we can't, the glaciers would melt much faster. 02:20footnotefootnote1.5 degrees Celsius. ""No way,"" I thought. Even the Paris Agreement's
ambitious targets aimed to limit global warming
to two degrees centigrade. 1.5 degrees centigrade is what they call
the best-case scenario. ""Now this can't be true,"" I thought. The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's third-largest
repository of ice, after the North and South Poles. That's why we are also called
the ""Third Pole."" There's a lot of ice in the region. And yes, the glaciers, they are melting. We know that. I have been to those in my country. I've seen them, and yes, they are melting. They are vulnerable. ""But they can't be that vulnerable,""
I remember thinking. 03:09But what if they are? What if our glaciers melt
much more quickly than I anticipate? What if our glaciers are much more
vulnerable than previously thought? And what if, as a result,
the glacial lakes -- now these are lakes
that form when glaciers melt -- what if those lakes burst
under the weight of additional water? And what if those floods
cascade into other glacial lakes, creating even bigger outbursts? That would create unprecedented
flash floods in my country. That would wreck my country. That would wreak havoc in my country. That would have the potential
to literally destroy our land, our livelihood, our way of life. 03:58footnotefootnoteSo that report caught my attention in ways that political stunts couldn't. It was put together by the International Centre for Integrated
Mountain Development, or ICIMOD, which is based in Nepal. Scientists and experts have studied
our glaciers for decades, and their report kept me awake at night,
agonizing about the bad news and what it meant for my country and my people. So after several sleepless nights, I went to Nepal to visit ICIMOD. 04:34I found a team of highly competent
and dedicated scientists there, and here's what they told me. 04:41Number one: the Hindu Kush Himalaya glaciers
have been melting for some time now. Take that glacier, for instance. It's on Mount Everest. As you can see, this once massive glacier
has already lost much of its ice. 05:02Number two: the glaciers are now melting
much more quickly -- so quickly, in fact, that at just
1.5 degrees centigrade of global warming, one-third of the glaciers would melt. At two degrees centigrade
of global warming, half the glaciers would disappear. And if current trends were to continue, a full two-thirds
of our glaciers would vanish. 05:30Number three: global warming means that our mountains
receive more rain and less snow ... and, unlike snowfall, rain melts ice, which just hurts
the health of our glaciers. 05:46footnotefootnoteNumber four: pollution in the region has increased
the amount of black carbon that's deposited on our glaciers. Black carbon is like soot. Black carbon absorbs heat and just accelerates
the melting of glaciers. 06:02To summarize, our glaciers are melting rapidly, and global warming is making them
melt much more quickly. 06:13footnotefootnoteBut what does this mean? It means that the 240 million people who live in the Hindu Kush
Himalaya region -- in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India,
China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and my own beloved country, Bhutan -- these people will be directly affected. When glaciers melt, when there's more rain and less snow, there will be huge changes
in the way water behaves. There will be more extremes: more intense rain,
more flash floods, more landslides, more glacial lake outburst floods. All this will cause
unimaginable destruction in a region that already has
some of the poorest people on earth. 07:03footnotefootnoteBut it's not just the people
in the immediate region who'll be affected. People living downstream
will also be hit hard. That's because 10 of their major rivers originate in the Hindu Kush
Himalaya mountains. These rivers provide
critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 1.6 billion people
living downstream. That's one in five humans. That's why the Hindu Kush
Himalaya mountains are also called
the ""water towers of Asia."" 07:43But when glaciers melt, when monsoons turn severe, those rivers will obviously flood, so there will be deluges
when water is not required and droughts will be very common, when water is desperately required. In short, Asia's water tower
will be broken, and that will be disastrous
for one-fifth of humanity. 08:14footnotefootnoteShould the rest of the world care? Should you, for instance, care? Remember, I didn't care
when I heard that the Maldives could disappear underwater. And that is the crux
of the problem, isn't it? We don't care. We don't care until
we are personally affected. I mean, we know.
We know climate change is real. We know that we face
drastic and dramatic change. We know that it is coming fast. Yet most of us act as if everything were normal. So we must care, all of us, and if you can't care for those who are
affected by the melting of glaciers, you should at least care for yourself. That's because the Hindu Kush
Himalaya mountains -- the entire region
is like the pulse of the planet. If the region falls sick, the entire planet will eventually suffer. And right now, with our glaciers melting rapidly, the region is not just sick -- it is crying out for help. 09:27footnotefootnoteAnd how will it affect
the rest of the world? One obvious scenario
is the potential destabilization caused by tens of millions
of climate refugees, who'll be forced to move
because they have no or little water, or because their livelihoods
have been destroyed by the melting of glaciers. Another scenario we can't take lightly is the potential of conflict over water and the political destabilization
in a region that has three nuclear powers: China, India, Pakistan. 10:09footnotefootnoteI believe that the situation
in our region is grave enough to warrant the creation
of a new intergovernmental agency. So as a native
from that part of the world, I want to propose here, today, the establishment
of the Third Pole Council, a high-level,
intergovernmental organization tasked with the singular responsibility of protecting the world's
third-largest repository of ice. A Third Pole Council would consist of all eight countries
located in the region as member countries, as equal member countries, and could also include
representative organizations and other countries
who have vested interests in the region as non-voting members. But the big idea is to get all stakeholders together
to work together. To work together to monitor
the health of the glaciers; to work together to shape and implement
policies to protect our glaciers, and, by extension, to protect the billions of people
who depend on our glaciers. 11:25We have to work together, because thinking globally,
acting locally ... does not work. We've tried that in Bhutan. We've made immense sacrifices
to act locally ... and while individual localized efforts
will continue to be important, they cannot stand up
to the onslaught of climate change. To stand up to climate change,
we must work together. We must think globally and act regionally. Our entire region must come together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to make our voices heard together. 12:15And that includes India and China. They must step up their game. They must take the ownership
of the fight to protect our glaciers. And for that, these two countries,
these two powerful giants, must reduce their own greenhouse gases, control their pollution,
and lead the fight. Lead the global fight
against climate change. And all that with a renewed
sense of urgency. Only then -- and that, too, only maybe -- will our region and other regions
that depend on our glaciers have any chance to avoid
major catastrophes. 13:03Time is running out. We must act together, now. Otherwise, the next time
Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest, that spectacular backdrop ... may look quite different. And if that happens, if our glaciers melt, rising sea levels
could well drown the Maldives. And while they can hold
their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world, their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing. 13:51footnotefootnoteThe Maldives are still distant, away. Their islands are distant
from where I live. But now, I pay close attention
to what happens out there. 14:09Thank you very much. 14:12(Applause)"
2,What nature can teach us about sustainable business,Erin Meezan,Feb 2022,"From glue alternatives inspired by gecko's feet to factories that produce a net benefit to the environment, Interface's VP and chief sustainability officer Erin Meezan explains how we can look to nature to learn how to make business more sustainable.

whenever you’re ready. 00:05Erin Meezan: There's so much
debate right now about what companies and countries
should be doing on climate. Nature is actually the best benchmark. Why don't we just follow
what it would do? Nature has 3.8 billion years
of R and D under its belt. So, you know, there's certainly
something nature has that maybe humans always don't. Nature can do complex chemistry, really interesting engineering. And so how can we look to nature and really harness what we know works to provide solutions for business
to be more sustainable? 00:42[In the Green: The Business
of Climate Action] 00:47[Presented by: TED Countdown
and The Climate Pledge] 00:51[Erin Meezan; Company: Interface;
Sector: Manufacturing; Location: USA] 00:54This is a carpet tile that we make. We operate in the building
and construction space, which is close to 40 percent
of global carbon emissions. So in that space, we’re putting a lot of materials,
like flooring, into buildings. 01:08When we started
on sustainability as a company, most of these products
had a significant impact on the planet. We wasted a lot of resources,
we recycled nothing, and they had a carbon footprint that we had never
even measured or understood. Interface became inspired to take the company
in a more sustainable direction. We took our product design team
out in the forest and asked: How would nature design a floor? What lessons could nature give us about moving away
from adhesives in our business? And that led to an exploration
of gecko's feet that allowed us to design an innovation that took the company off glue and really helped us build
a whole new business by being inspired by nature. 01:55We did things to reduce waste. We've swapped out
less sustainable materials for recycled and bio-based materials. And so over 20 years, we've been able to innovate
and create something that actually stores
more carbon than it emits, has a net benefit to the environment. 02:14We really challenged ourselves
to say, what's beyond that? Could we create a factory
that has a positive impact, and what might that look like? Nature, for example, harvests
and collects and purifies rainwater. So what we've done
in some of our factory locations is install rainwater collection devices to be able to take that rainwater out, use that in our manufacturing operations. Nature stores carbon. And so we have opportunities
onsite through planting, possibly removal of parking lots, possibly by establishing green roofs, to store carbon on-site and in the buildings within our company. 02:56And I'm really excited now that it's not just Interface
trying to figure this out. Other companies started
to hear us talking about it and got really interested in it. We could share the work that we had done, and other companies
could accelerate their learning, but also they committed to share
what they were doing. And we're hopeful that this will
continue to pick up momentum. 03:19I think the question for everybody is: What’s your carbon-negative carpet tile? It goes from the idea
of a sustainable carpet tile to a sustainable building
to a sustainable city. 03:30If we're going to meaningfully
address global warming, we have to imagine not just
these products alone, but the collective effort
of what we can do together to have a positive impact
on the environment."
2,Metal that breathes,Doris Kim Sung,Oct 2012,"Modern buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows give spectacular views, but they require a lot of energy to cool. Doris Kim Sung works with thermo-bimetals, smart materials that act more like human skin, dynamically and responsively, and can shade a room from sun and self-ventilate.", (38K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Joseph Geni, TranslatorMorton Bast, Reviewer00:00I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car, I basically had to roll down the window. It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly, and my father would not let us use the air conditioner. He said that it would overheat the engine. And you might remember, some of you, how the cars were back then, and it was a common problem of overheating. But it was also the signal that capped the use, or overuse, of energy-consuming devices. 00:30Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country. We blast the air conditioning the entire way, and we never experience overheating. So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. 00:41Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings. In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls. The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime, and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior. Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass, rolled steel and mass production, we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views, and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces. Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger, our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy. They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere, and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas, but we also have problems that, when we lose power, we can't open a window here, and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut. 02:14So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug? If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know, I was a biology major before I went into architecture, the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing. That's the first line of defense for the body. It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently, and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin, and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive and differentiated, depending on where it is. 02:59And this gets me back to my research. What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that. I presently, or currently, work with smart materials, and a smart thermo-bimetal. First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture. What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together. You can see that here by the different reflection on this side. And because it has two different coefficients of expansion, when heated, one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action. So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system, and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated, and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it. It's called ""Bloom,"" and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through, and in other areas, it's a ventilating system, so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. 04:28You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually. Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today, this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different. And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls. 04:59So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture, and in this case, here you see a house, that's for a developer in China, and it's actually a four-story glass box. It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access, but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer, it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface. In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy, so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day. And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. 05:54I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market, and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel, and in that panel, between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing, I'm trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building, and totally, if necessary. And so you can imagine, even in this application, that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. 06:45And these are some later studies that I'm working on right now that are on the boards, where you can see, in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to, we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes. 07:01This last project is also of components. The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper. And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system. They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles, and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down, and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too, how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building. And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows. On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks, and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different components that I'm working on, and again, it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. 08:06So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials. When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day, when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls, or when there's a power outage, and you have no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly, efficiently and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause)"
2,Emergency medicine for our climate fever,Kelly Wanser,Aug 2019,"As we recklessly warm the planet by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, some industrial emissions also produce particles that reflect sunshine back into space, putting a check on global warming that we're only starting to understand.

important that may be new to you. The governments of the world are about to conduct
an unintentional experiment on our climate. In 2020, new rules will require ships
to lower their sulfur emissions by scrubbing their dirty exhaust or switching to cleaner fuels. For human health, this is really good, but sulfur particles
in the emission of ships also have an effect on clouds. This is a satellite image of marine clouds off the Pacific West Coast
of the United States. The streaks in the clouds
are created by the exhaust from ships. Ships' emissions include
both greenhouse gases, which trap heat over long periods of time, and particulates like sulfates
that mix with clouds and temporarily make them brighter. Brighter clouds reflect
more sunlight back to space, cooling the climate. So in fact, humans are currently running
two unintentional experiments on our climate. 01:01In the first one, we're increasing
the concentration of greenhouse gases and gradually warming the earth system. This works something like a fever
in the human body. If the fever remains low,
its effects are mild, but as the fever rises,
damage grows more severe and eventually devastating. We're seeing a little of this now. 01:22footnotefootnoteIn our other experiment, we're planning to remove
a layer of particles that brighten clouds and shield us
from some of this warming. The effect is strongest
in ocean clouds like these, and scientists expect the reduction
of sulfur emissions from ships next year to produce a measurable increase
in global warming. 01:43footnotefootnoteBit of a shocker? In fact, most emissions contain sulfates
that brighten clouds: coal, diesel exhaust, forest fires. Scientists estimate that the total
cooling effect from emission particles, which they call aerosols
when they're in the climate, may be as much as all of the warming
we've experienced up until now. There's a lot of uncertainty
around this effect, and it's one of the major reasons
why we have difficulty predicting climate, but this is cooling that we'll lose
as emissions fall. So to be clear, humans
are currently cooling the planet by dispersing particles
into the atmosphere at massive scale. We just don't know how much,
and we're doing it accidentally. That's worrying, but it could mean that we have
a fast-acting way to reduce warming, emergency medicine
for our climate fever if we needed it, and it's a medicine
with origins in nature. 02:44This is a NASA simulation
of earth's atmosphere, showing clouds and particles
moving over the planet. The brightness is the Sun's light
reflecting from particles in clouds, and this reflective shield
is one of the primary ways that nature keeps the planet
cool enough for humans and all of the life that we know. In 2015, scientists assessed possibilities
for rapidly cooling climate. They discounted
things like mirrors in space, ping-pong balls in the ocean,
plastic sheets on the Arctic, and they found
that the most viable approaches involved slightly increasing
this atmospheric reflectivity. In fact, it's possible that reflecting
just one or two percent more sunlight from the atmosphere could offset two degrees Celsius
or more of warming. 03:35footnotefootnoteNow, I'm a technology executive,
not a scientist. About a decade ago,
concerned about climate, I started to talk with scientists about
potential countermeasures to warming. These conversations grew
into collaborations that became the Marine
Cloud Brightening Project, which I'll talk about momentarily, and the nonprofit policy organization
SilverLining, where I am today. I work with politicians, researchers, members of the tech industry and others to talk about some of these ideas. Early on, I met British
atmospheric scientist John Latham, who proposed cooling the climate
the way that the ships do, but with a natural source of particles: sea-salt mist from seawater sprayed from ships into areas
of susceptible clouds over the ocean. The approach became known
by the name I gave it then, ""marine cloud brightening."" Early modeling studies suggested
that by deploying marine cloud brightening in just 10 to 20 percent
of susceptible ocean clouds, it might be possible to offset
as much as two degrees Celsius's warming. It might even be possible
to brighten clouds in local regions to reduce the impacts caused
by warming ocean surface temperatures. For example, regions
such as the Gulf Atlantic might be cooled in the months
before a hurricane season to reduce the force of storms. Or, it might be possible to cool waters
flowing onto coral reefs overwhelmed by heat stress, like Australia's Great Barrier Reef. 05:04footnotefootnoteBut these ideas are only theoretical, and brightening marine clouds
is not the only way to increase the reflection
of the sunlight from the atmosphere. Another occurs when large volcanoes
release material with enough force to reach the upper layer
of the atmosphere, the stratosphere. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, it released material
into the stratosphere, including sulfates that mix
with the atmosphere to reflect sunlight. This material remained
and circulated around the planet. It was enough to cool the climate
by over half a degree Celsius for about two years. This cooling led to a striking increase
in Arctic ice cover in 1992, which dropped in subsequent years
as the particles fell back to earth. But the volcanic phenomenon
led Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen to propose the idea that dispersing
particles into the stratosphere in a controlled way might be
a way to counter global warming. Now, this has risks
that we don't understand, including things like
heating up the stratosphere or damage to the ozone layer. Scientists think that there could be
safe approaches to this, but is this really where we are? Is this really worth considering? 06:23footnotefootnoteThis is a simulation from the US National Center
for Atmospheric Research global climate model showing,
earth surface temperatures through 2100. The globe on the left visualizes
our current trajectory, and on the right, a world where particles
are introduced into the stratosphere gradually in 2020, and maintained through 2100. Intervention keeps surface temperatures
near those of today, while without it, temperatures rise
well over three degrees. This could be the difference
between a safe and an unsafe world. 06:57So, if there's even a chance
that this could be close to reality, is this something
we should consider seriously? Today, there are no capabilities, and scientific knowledge
is extremely limited. We don't know whether these types
of interventions are even feasible, or how to characterize their risks. Researchers hope to explore
some basic questions that might help us know
whether or not these might be real options or whether we should rule them out. It requires multiple ways
of studying the climate system, including computer models
to forecast changes, analytic techniques like machine learning, and many types of observations. And though it's controversial, it's also critical that researchers
develop core technologies and perform small-scale,
real-world experiments. 07:51footnotefootnoteThere are two research programs
proposing experiments like this. At Harvard, the SCoPEx experiment
would release very small amounts of sulfates, calcium carbonate and water
into the stratosphere with a balloon, to study chemistry and physics effects. How much material? Less than the amount released
in one minute of flight from a commercial aircraft. So this is definitely not dangerous, and it may not even be scary. 08:21footnotefootnoteAt the University of Washington, scientists hope to spray
a fine mist of salt water into clouds in a series of land and ocean tests. If those are successful,
this would culminate in experiments to measurably brighten
an area of clouds over the ocean. The marine cloud brightening effort
is the first to develop any technology for generating aerosols for atmospheric
sunlight reflection in this way. It requires producing
very tiny particles -- think about the mist that comes
out of an asthma inhaler -- at massive scale -- so think
of looking up at a cloud. It's a tricky engineering problem. 08:59footnotefootnoteSo this one nozzle they developed generates three trillion
particles per second, 80 nanometers in size, from very corrosive saltwater. It was developed by a team
of retired engineers in Silicon Valley -- here they are -- working full-time for six years,
without pay, for their grandchildren. It will take a few million dollars
and another year or two to develop the full spray system
they need to do these experiments. In other parts of the world,
research efforts are emerging, including small modeling programs
at Beijing Normal University in China, the Indian Institute of Science, a proposed center for climate repair
at Cambridge University in the UK and the DECIMALS Fund, which sponsors researchers
in global South countries to study the potential impacts
of these sunlight interventions in their part of the world. But all of these programs,
including the experimental ones, lack significant funding. And understanding
these interventions is a hard problem. The earth is a vast, complex system and we need major investments
in climate models, observations and basic science to be able to predict climate
much better than we can today and manage both our accidental
and any intentional interventions. 10:17And it could be urgent. Recent scientific reports
predict that in the next few decades, earth's fever is on a path to devastation: extreme heat and fires, major loss of ocean life, collapse of Arctic ice, displacement and suffering
for hundreds of millions of people. The fever could even reach tipping points
where warming takes over and human efforts are no longer enough to counter accelerating changes
in natural systems. 10:49To prevent this circumstance, the UN's International Panel
on Climate Change predicts that we need to stop
and even reverse emissions by 2050. How? We have to quickly and radically
transform major economic sectors, including energy, construction,
agriculture, transportation and others. And it is imperative that we do this
as fast as we can. But our fever is now so high that climate experts say
we also have to remove massive quantities of CO2
from the atmosphere, possibly 10 times
all of the world's annual emissions, in ways that aren't proven yet. 11:27Right now, we have slow-moving solutions
to a fast-moving problem. Even with the most optimistic assumptions, our exposure to risk
in the next 10 to 30 years is unacceptably high, in my opinion. 11:40Could interventions like these
provide fast-acting medicine if we need it to reduce the earth's fever
while we address its underlying causes? There are real concerns about this idea. Some people are very worried
that even researching these interventions could provide an excuse to delay efforts
to reduce emissions. This is also known as a moral hazard. But, like most medicines, interventions are more dangerous
the more that you do, so research actually
tends to draw out the fact that we absolutely,
positively cannot continue to fill up the atmosphere
with greenhouse gases, that these kinds of alternatives are risky and if we were to use them, we would need to use
as little as possible. 12:24But even so, could we ever learn enough
about these interventions to manage the risk? Who would make decisions
about when and how to intervene? What if some people are worse off, or they just think they are? These are really hard problems. But what really worries me
is that as climate impacts worsen, leaders will be called on to respond
by any means available. I for one don't want them to act
without real information and much better options. 12:58Scientists think it will take
a decade of research just to assess these interventions, before we ever were
to develop or use them. Yet today, the global level of investment
in these interventions is effectively zero. So, we need to move quickly if we want policymakers
to have real information on this kind of emergency medicine. 13:24footnotefootnoteThere is hope! The world has solved
these kinds of problems before. In the 1970s, we identified
an existential threat to our protective ozone layer. In the 1980s, scientists,
politicians and industry came together in a solution to replace
the chemicals causing the problem. They achieved this with the only
legally binding environmental agreement signed by all countries in the world, the Montreal Protocol. Still in force today, it has resulted in a recovery
of the ozone layer and is the most successful
environmental protection effort in human history. 14:01We have a far greater threat now, but we do have the ability
to develop and agree on solutions to protect people and restore our climate to health. This could mean that to remain safe, we reflect sunlight for a few decades, while we green our industries
and remove CO2. It definitely means we must work now to understand our options
for this kind of emergency medicine. 14:29Thank you, 14:31(Applause)"
2,Can seaweed help curb global warming?,Tim Flannery,Sep 2019,"It's time for planetary-scale interventions to combat climate change -- and environmentalist Tim Flannery thinks seaweed can help. In a bold talk, he shares the epic carbon-capturing potential of seaweed, explaining how oceangoing seaweed farms created on a massive scale could trap all the carbon we emit into the atmosphere. Learn more about this potentially planet-saving solution -- and the work that's still needed to get there.", (95K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийالعربيةગુજરાતી中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:04Oh, there's a lot of it. This is seaweed. It's pretty humble stuff. But it does have
some remarkable qualities. For one, it grows really fast. So the carbon that is part
of that seaweed, just a few weeks ago, was floating in the atmosphere
as atmospheric CO2, driving all the adverse consequences
of climate change. For the moment, it's locked
safely away in the seaweed, but when that seaweed rots -- and by the smell of it,
it's not far away -- when it rots, that CO2 will be released
back to the atmosphere. Wouldn't it be fantastic
if we could find a way of keeping that CO2 locked up long-term, and thereby significantly contributing
to solving the climate problem? 01:03What I'm talking about here is drawdown. It's now become the other half
of the climate challenge. And that's because
we have delayed so long, in terms of addressing climate change, that we now have to do two very big
and very difficult things at once. We have to cut our emissions
and clean our energy supply at the same time that we draw
significant volumes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. If we don't do that, about 25 percent
of the CO2 we put in the air will remain there,
by human standards, forever. So we have to act. 01:42This is really a new phase
in addressing the climate crisis and it demands new thinking. So, ideas like carbon offsets
really don't make sense in the modern era. You know, when you offset something, you say, ""I'll permit myself to put
some greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, but then I'll offset it
by drawing it down."" When you've got to both cut your emissions and draw down CO2, that thinking doesn't make sense anymore. And when we're talking about drawdown, we're talking about putting large volumes
of greenhouses gases, particularly CO2, out of circulation. And to do that, we need a carbon price. We need a significant price
that we'll pay for that service that we'll all benefit from. 02:26We've made almost no progress so far with the second half
of the climate challenge. It's not on most people's radar. And, you know, I must say,
at times, I hear people saying, ""I've lost hope that we can do anything
about the climate crisis."" And look, I've had my sleepless
nights too, I can tell you. But I'm here today as an ambassador
for this humble weed, seaweed. I think it has the potential to be a big part of addressing
the challenge of climate change and a big part of our future. 03:02Now, what the scientists are telling us
we need to do over the next 80-odd years to the end of this century, is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year, and draw three gigatons of CO2
out of the atmosphere every year. Those numbers are so large
that they baffle us. But that's what the scientists
tell us we need to do. I really hate showing this graph, but I'm sorry, I have to do it. It is very eloquent
in terms of telling the story of my personal failure in terms of all the advocacy I've done
in climate change work and in fact, our collective failure
to address climate change. You can see our trajectory there in terms of warming
and greenhouse gas concentrations. You can see all of the great
scientific announcements that we've made, saying how much danger
we face with climate change. You can see the political meetings. None of it has changed the trajectory. And this is why we need new thinking, we need a new approach. 04:03So how might we go about drawing down
greenhouse gases at a large scale? There's really only two ways of doing it, and I've done a very deep dive
into drawdown. And I'll preempt my -- And I would say this stuff comes up
smelling like roses at the end of the day. It does, it's one of the best options, but there are many, many possibilities. There are chemical pathways
and biological pathways. So two ways, really,
of getting the job done. 04:36The biological pathways are fantastic because the energy source
that's needed to drive them, the sun, is effectively free. We use the sun to drive
photosynthesis in plants, break apart that CO2
and capture the carbon. There are also chemical pathways. They sound ominous, but actually,
they're not bad at all. The difficulty they face is
that we have to actually pay for the energy
that's required to do the job or pay to facilitate that energy. Direct air capture is a great example
of a chemical pathway, and people are using that right now
to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels
or manufacture plastics. Great progress is being made, but it will be many decades before those chemical pathways
are drawing down a gigaton of CO2 a year. 05:21The biological pathways offer us
a lot more hope, I think, in the short term. You've probably heard
about reforestation, planting trees, as a solution to the climate problem. You know, it's a fair question: Can we plant our way out
of this problem by using trees? I'm skeptical about that
for a number of reasons. One is just the scale of the problem. All trees start as seeds,
little tiny things, and it's many decades
before they've reached their full carbon-capture potential. And secondly, if you look at the land surface,
you see that it's so heavily utilized. We get our food from it,
we get our forestry products from it, biodiversity protection
and water and everything else. To expect that we'll find enough space
to deal with this problem, I think is going to be quite problematic. 06:09But if we look offshore, wee see a solution where there's already
an existing industry, and where there's a clearer way forward. The oceans cover
about 70 percent of our planet. They play a really big role
in regulating our climate, and if we can enhance
the growth of seaweed in them, we can use them, I think,
to develop a climate-altering crop. There are so many
different kinds of seaweed, there's unbelievable
genetic diversity in seaweed, and they're very ancient; they were some of the first
multicellular organisms ever to evolve. People are using special
kinds of seaweed now for particular purposes, like developing very high-quality
pharmaceutical products. But you can also use seaweed
to take a seaweed bath, it's supposed to be good for your skin; I can't testify to that,
but you can do it. The scalability is the big thing
about seaweed farming. 06:59You know, if we could cover
nine percent of the world's ocean in seaweed farms, we could draw down the equivalent
of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year, more than 50 gigatons. Now, I thought that was fantastic
when I first read it, but I thought I'd better calculate how big
nine percent of the world's oceans is. It turns out, it's about
four and a half Australias, the place I live in. And how close are we
to that at the moment? How many ocean-going seaweed farms
do we actually have out there? Zero. But we do have some prototypes,
and therein lies some hope. 07:33This little drawing here of a seaweed farm
that's currently under construction tells you some very interesting
things about seaweed. You can see the seaweed
growing on that rack, 25 meters down in the ocean there. It's really different
from anything you see on land. And the reason being that, you know,
seaweed is not like trees, it doesn't have nonproductive parts like roots and trunks
and branches and bark. The whole of the plant
is pretty much photosynthetic, so it grows fast. Seaweed can grow a meter a day. 08:06And how do we sequester the carbon? Again, it's very different from on land. All you need to do
is cut that seaweed off -- drifts into the ocean abyss, Once it's down a kilometer, the carbon in that seaweed is effectively
out of the atmospheric system for centuries or millennia. Whereas if you plant a forest, you've got to worry
about forest fires, bugs, etc., releasing that carbon. The key to this farm, though, is that little pipe
going down into the depths. You know, the mid-ocean is basically
a vast biological desert. There's no nutrients there
that were used up long ago. But just 500 meters down, there is cool, very nutrient-rich water. And with just a little bit
of clean, renewable energy, you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it
to irrigate your seaweed crop. So I think this really has
so many benefits. It's changing a biological desert, the mid-ocean, into a productive, maybe even
planet-saving solution. 09:13So what could go wrong? Well, anything we're talking
about at this scale involves a planetary-scale intervention. And we have to be very careful. I think that piles of stinking seaweed are probably going to be
the least of our problems. There's other unforeseen things
that will happen. One of the things that really worries me,
when I talk about this, is the fate of biodiversity
in the deep ocean. If we are putting gigatons of seaweed
into the deep ocean, we're affecting life down there. 09:39The good news is that we know that a lot of seaweed
already reaches the deep ocean, after storms or through submarine canyons. So we're not talking
about a novel process here; we are talking about
enhancing a natural process. And we'll learn as we go. I mean, it may be that these ocean-going
seaweed farms will need to be mobile, to distribute the seaweed
across vast areas of the ocean, rather than creating
a big stinking pile in one place. It may be that we'll need
to char the seaweed -- so create a sort of an inert,
mineral biochar before we dispatch it into the deep. We won't know until we start the process, and we will learn effectively by doing. 10:22I just want to take you
to contemporary seaweed farming. It's a big business -- it's a six-billion-dollar-a-year business. These seaweed farms off South Korea -- you can see them from space,
they are huge. And they're increasingly
not just seaweed farms. What people are doing in places like this
is something called ocean permaculture. And in ocean permaculture, you grow fish, shellfish
and seaweed all together. And the reason it works so well is that the seaweed
makes the seawater less acid. It provides an ideal environment
for growing marine protein. If we covered nine percent
of the world's oceans in ocean permaculture, we would be producing enough protein
in the form of fish and shellfish to give every person
in a population of 10 billion 200 kilograms of high-quality
protein per year. So, we've got a multipotent solution here. We can address climate change,
we can feed the world, we can deacidify the oceans. 11:20The economics of all of this
is going to be challenging. We'll be investing many,
many billions of dollars into these solutions, and they will take decades
to get to the gigaton scale. The reason that I'm convinced
that this is going to happen is that unless we get the gas
out of the air, it is going to keep driving
adverse consequences. It will flood our cities, it will deprive us of food, it will cause all sorts of civil unrest. So anyone who's got a solution
to dealing with this problem has a valuable asset. And already, as I've explained, ocean permaculture is well on the road
to being economically sustainable. You know, in the next 30 years, we have to go from being
a carbon-emitting economy to a carbon-absorbing economy. And that doesn't seem like very long. But half of the greenhouse gases
that we've put into the atmosphere, we've put there in the last 30 years. 12:19My argument is, if we can put the gas in in 30 years, we can pull it out in 30 years. And if you doubt how much
can be done over 30 years, just cast your mind back
a century, to 1919, compare it with 1950. Now, in 1919, here in Edinburgh, you might have seen
a canvas and wood biplane. Thirty years later,
you'd be seeing jet aircraft. Transport in the street
were horses in 1919. By 1950, they're motor vehicles. 1919, we had gun powder; 1950, we had nuclear power. We can do a lot in a short period of time. But it all depends upon us believing
that we can find a solution. 13:01Now what I would love to do
is bring together all of the people with knowledge in this space. The engineers who know
how to build structures offshore, the seaweed farmers, the financiers, the government regulators, the people who understand
how things are done. And chart a way forward, say: How do we go from the existing
six-billion-dollar-a-year, inshore seaweed industry, to this new form of industry,
which has got so much potential, but will require large
amounts of investment? I'm not a betting man, you know. But if I were, I'll tell you, my money
would be on that stuff, it would be on seaweed. It's my hero. 13:41Thank you. 13:42(Applause)"
2,Why don't we cover the desert with solar panels?,Dan Kwartler,Oct 2021,"Stretching over roughly nine million square kilometers and with sands reaching temperatures of up to 80° Celsius, the Sahara Desert receives about 22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That's well over 100 times more energy than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar panels solve our energy problems? Dan Kwartler digs into the possibility.

reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good? 00:35Solar panels work when light particles hit
their surface with enough energy to knock electrons 
out of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, 
these electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power
panels can generate. Solar panels can only interact 
with certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert 
over half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert
often bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. 01:06But thanks to clever scientists 
and engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating 
more electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns 
on the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming 
light particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial
solar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching
up to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten 
89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains
for other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have 
made solar power the cheapest source of electricity 
on Earth. 01:52Countries including India, China, 
Egypt, and the US, have already taken
these new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range 
from 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands
of local residents. But these farms also get
extremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert 
or reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many
farms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water 
to maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels 
in the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem
on the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes
in the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already
disrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could 
dramatically transform the desert landscape. 02:59Thankfully, solar panels
aren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants 
in the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly 
30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light 
onto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,
and then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous
temperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential
to transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials
being heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing
electricity past sunset. 03:43Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to
fit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond
local power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to
connect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy
in massive batteries, or convert their electricity 
into clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still
too expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables
can share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations 
and carbon-emitting global supply chains. 04:24Fortunately, solar can
exist on many scales, from industrial solar farms 
to smaller installations that power individual buildings 
and rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use
or provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely 
on a few simple components, they’re quick to install 
and relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility 
that enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous 
over the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's
rising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small."

to power the world thousands of times over for all of civilization. Pretty cool, right? 01:07So we got to get to it. How do we do that? Let's tap it. Let's tap it fast. I'm a climate activist. I am very worried about climate change. It keeps me up at night. So we need to make this happen, right? So how? So I'm here with good news
about that and also a proposition. Let's do the good news first. 01:31There are teams of innovators
right now in the field that are working on figuring out
how to most efficiently and effectively tap this enormous
heat source beneath us. And they are running sprints, and I'm not talking about the type
of geothermal that you find in Iceland. That's easy to get to. It's shallow, it's close to the surface, and in those places in the world,
we already have geothermal energy. I'm talking about making
geothermal energy accessible anywhere and everywhere in the world
that energy is needed. But in order to do that, we've got to figure out
how to mimic the conditions that occur in places like Iceland, right, that make geothermal easy to tap
and extract and harvest. And those conditions are hot rocks, pore space in the rocks and water filling those pores. Those conditions seem simple, but they actually occur naturally in very,
very few places in the world, right? And that's why we don't have
geothermal energy everywhere. We have it in just a few places. 02:39But the past couple of decades, there have been really disruptive
and breakthrough technological innovations that enable us to engineer the subsurface to mimic Mother Nature's geothermal. So technological innovations like high-pressure
and temperature-drilling technologies that were developed for offshore
oil and gas exploration. Technologies like directional drilling, where no longer we can just
drill straight down, but instead we can actually turn
and steer drill bits to reach very precise
and specific locations in the subsurface, miles underground. And we can also fracture rock now, which means that we can create pore space where pore space does not exist naturally. So if you take these innovations
that I just listed and you put them all together, you end up enabling an entirely new breed
of scalable geothermal concepts. Geothermal concepts can be done
anywhere in the world. 03:39So, for instance now, we have engineered
geothermal systems or EGS. In this concept,
several wells are drilled, at the bottom of the well
the rock is fractured. It creates a reservoir under the surface. Think of it as a pot where you boil
your water underground, right? You send a fluid down, it percolates through the fractures. It comes back up really hot, and we use it for all sorts
of interesting and important things like heating buildings directly. Or we can run it through a turbine
to produce electricity. Now, EGS can take a lot of forms. This is an area of intense
innovation right now. You can engineer these systems
in a variety of ways, but the basic concepts stay the same. 04:17Then we have closed-loop systems. Closed loops are pretty new. It's another really
hot area of innovation. Same concept, basic is EGS, you have one or more wells drilled, you create a reservoir underground, but in closed loops, instead of fracturing
to create that reservoir underground, it's entirely drilled,
like a radiator in the rock. And they take many forms too,
just like EGS, check it out. You can see in closed-loop systems
how useful it is to be able to turn and steer that drill bit right? Totally enabling in terms of getting
these concepts to work. 04:51Another really cool aspect
of closed-loop systems, another fierce area
of innovation right now, is what we're putting in these systems
as the working fluid to harvest the heat. Most of the time it's water. But what if we could optimize a fluid
to perform better than water? So it heats up faster than water
at lower temperatures than water. And the really cool thing
about closed loops is the going candidate, right, one everybody loves right now to put in these systems
to most efficiently harvest heat is actually a substance that's the center
of our climate angst right now. It's around us in excess in abundance. It's CO2. Super cool. 05:35So then there's hybrids, not the cars,
geothermal hybrids. You take the best of both worlds, right? You get the increased surface area and heat that you get from
fracturing rock. You combine that
with a closed-loop well design so you can use that optimized fluid. The goal of hybrid systems
is to extract the most heat, minimize drilling costs. So that's what's happening right now. A lot of innovation. It's really, really cool. But these concepts, none of them are without
their technology challenges. 06:07But y’all, these are not moonshots. They are not moonshots. We are talking about making
very incremental changes to existing technologies,
methods and techniques with an eye on more hotter
and deeper geothermal development. And these also aren't just ideas. 06:30There are teams right now in the field
demonstrating these concepts. Teams like Sage Geosystems,
a team that I mentor. This is a well that they are
demonstrating this summer in -- get this -- Texas. Not in Iceland,
not on the side of a volcano, not in the ring of fire. This is a Texas pasture where you would never suspect
the enormous geothermal resources that lie below. And this well is an existing
abandoned oil and gas well that they have repurposed
for this geothermal demonstration. If all goes well with this demonstration, by 2022, that is next year, they will have a geothermal
power plant in Texas. 07:16There are dozens of examples like this,
right now in the field. These are all start-ups. They're out there proving
geothermal concepts, new technologies, new drilling, the concepts that I
showed you in the slides. We are in the midst
of a geothermal renaissance. In the past 18 months, more geothermal start-ups have launched
than in the past 10 years combined. If even one of these
start-ups is successful at proving a scalable geothermal concept, we are literally off to the races
in developing this massive, reliable 24/7 clean energy source
anywhere in the world. And by off to the races,
I mean that, right? Like, we got to go. The clock is ticking, we need scale. It's going to be cute if it works, but we've got to have global scale. 08:05So how do we do that? It brings me to my proposition. So it turns out that there is an industry
that is perfectly positioned to take us from the few geothermal
power plants we have today to the hundreds of thousands
that we need to meet demand. The industry that everyone loves to hate, who cares about the
environment and climate, is that industry. To scale geothermal,
what do we need to do? We need to efficiently, effectively
and safely drill below the surface over and over and over and over again. And who does that now? The oil and gas industry does that now. 08:54The oil and gas industry is a global specialized
workforce of millions, backed by almost 200 years
of breakthrough technological innovation, all aimed at exploring for, drilling for and producing energy
from deep underground. You flip the switch
and you have green drilling. And oil and gas keeps
its current business model, the business model that keeps them
firmly rooted in hydrocarbons now. They're doing what they know how to do, which is exploring for, drilling for and producing a subsurface energy asset. 09:38But what we're talking
about here is a pivot from hydrocarbons to heat. A global workforce of millions,
highly skilled and trained doesn't need to be retrained. They can keep doing
what they already know how to do. But this time around for clean energy. If we're able to pull this off
and team up to do it, we are talking about the ability
to meet world energy demand. We are talking about the ability
over the next few decades to put more geothermal energy on the grid than we currently have in dirty energy. Geothermal energy at oil and gas scale. 10:21So I bet I know
what some of you are thinking because I was that person
to like, I used to think it. And so I will tell you how I got
from there to here. I used to feel that we just needed to let
the oil and gas industry go away. So I'm a climate activist
and a lifelong environmentalist, the kind that would have chained myself
to a tree if I needed to, of that flavor. I grew up and got a job,
became an energy lawyer and then an energy entrepreneur, and entrepreneurship took me out
into the field for product deployments, and I ended up living on drill rigs. And I had a complete epiphany, it was a total mind shift, bias out the door. Because I got to know many individuals
in the oil and gas workforce. And y'all that grit. I mean, it is incredible grit. Those people are there for it. But I also got to know
the amazing technological innovations of that industry. And what I've come to believe
is those are assets. The workforce, the technologies, they are assets that we can leverage now
to solve climate change. So what I do for my job is I recruit oil and gas veterans
to the cause of geothermal. If we want to turn the ship, we recruit the sailors. And it's working. So there's good news. 11:54Do you remember that slide I showed you
with all the start-ups, the geothermal start-ups
that are in the field? A good many of those teams
are actually oil and gas veterans. Sage Geosystems with their Texas well. That is an all-oil-and-gas team with almost 300 years
of collective experience at entities like Shell, BP,
Halliburton and Weatherford. Y'all, that is really interesting, right? I mean, that world take notice because what this is is oil and gas
brains actively reinventing themselves, using everything they know that they learned in their entire
oil and gas experience to solve climate change. But it's also interesting because this new flourish
of entrepreneur, you know, oil and gas veteran
turned geothermal entrepreneur is helping the oil and gas industry
engage actively with this problem set. They speak the language of oil and gas. They understand the business
models of oil and gas. They are out building
partnerships and relationships with oil and gas entities that are based on decades
of trust and experience they have with one another. In the past six months, geothermal start-ups have closed more
than 100 million dollars in funding deals with oil and gas entities
as funding partners. We are at the beginning
of a huge and exciting shift here. If it's the best and brightest
minds in oil and gas who are off launching
geothermal companies, then y'all, this very well may be the future of the oil
and gas industry itself. 13:34But here's my worry. So say oil and gas grabs the reins here,
takes us to global scale fast, exponential growth. We put terawatts
of geothermal energy on the grid. Are we going to fight about this? The thing that I love about geothermal is that it gives us all
a way around ourselves, right? A way around extreme polarization. Environmentalists and drillers, dogs and cats, right and left, we all get what we want. Clean energy where we need it, climate change solved, energy poverty solved and drillers keep drilling. If we build the right collaborations here and unite behind a shared vision, we solve energy in the next 30 years. We change the conversation from worrying about whether
we're going to meet 2050 climate goals to how they look kind of lazy. We can do this. We've just got to drill the limit. 14:44Thank you. 14:46(Applause)"
2,What if cracks in concrete could fix themselves?,Congrui Jin,Oct 2018,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But it does have a weakness: it's prone to catastrophic cracking that has immense financial and environmental impact. What if we could avoid that problem? Congrui Jin explores how to create a more resilient concrete. [TED-Ed Animation by Aeon Production].", (46K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCrnogorskiEnglishEspañolFrançaisNederlandsO'zbekPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:07Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? 00:31This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. 01:05While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. 01:56Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. 02:31Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. 02:55So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. 03:51Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life."
2,5 transformational policies for a prosperous and sustainable world,Johan Rockström,Oct 2018,"In a talk about how we can build a robust future without wrecking the planet, sustainability expert Johan Rockström debuts the Earth3 model -- a new methodology that combines the UN Sustainable Development Goals with the nine planetary boundaries, beyond which earth's vital systems could become unstable. Learn more about five transformational policies that could help us achieve inclusive and prosperous world development while keeping the earth stable and resilient.", (54K),"Transcript (15 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroTiếng ViệtTürkçeעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00In 2015, we saw two fantastic,
hopeful breakthroughs for humanity. First, the adoption of
the Sustainable Development Goals, the collective, universal
plan for humanity to eradicate hunger, [promote] good economic
development and good health, within global environmental targets. Secondly, after 21 years of negotiations, we adopted the legally binding
Paris Agreement, all nations in the world keeping
global warming under two degrees Celsius, aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Today, three years down the line,
we're still in the hand-waving business. 00:35Now, I think it's time
to step back one step and recognize that I wonder if the world
leaders really knew what they signed at the General Assembly three years ago. These are universal, aspirational,
transformational goals for inclusive, prosperous humanity
on a stable earth system. But there are underlying problems. We have inherent contradictions
between these goals, where there's the risk of pursuing
one favored goal at the expense of others. Take, for example, Goal 8,
on decent work and economic growth. If we continue doing that
by exploiting natural resources and burning fossil fuels, it will be impossible to reach Goal 13. Three years down the line,
we simply must admit we're seeing limited action
to really, really address this as an inclusive, collective,
universal package. 01:25Now, this requires us
to step back one step. I think we have to ask ourselves
some hard questions: Do we have any chance of accomplishing
the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030? Are there actually inherent trade-offs that are not compatible
with our current development paradigm? But are there, perhaps, synergies
where we can really accelerate change? And is it really a people-planet agenda, really taking seriously
the social and economic aspirational goals within the life-support systems on earth? 01:58Now, citizens across the world
have started to recognize that we're facing global
rising environmental risks; in fact, that a stable planet
is a prerequisite to have good human well-being on earth. We need to define a safe operating space
on a stable earth system, and the planetary boundary
framework was introduced by the scientific community in 2009 to do exactly that. It has now been widely embraced
across the world in policy, business and communities as a framework for sustainable development in the Anthropocene. 02:31This slide really shows the framework
with the nine environmental processes that regulate the stability
of the earth system, providing a safe operating space, where we'll have a high chance
of having good human well-being and prosperity and equity. If we move into the yellow zone,
we enter a dangerous uncertainty zone; and into the red, we have a high
likelihood of crossing tipping points that could take us irreversibly away
from the ability of the earth system to provide social and economic
well-being for humanity. 03:03Now, we can today, scientifically,
quantify these boundaries, providing us a stable
earth system for humanity. But we have to go beyond this and recognize the Sustainable
Development Goals -- if we really want
to seriously accomplish them -- must now occur within
this safe operating space. We need to achieve SDGs within PBs. 03:26But dear friends, not even this is enough. We need to recognize
that the Sustainable Development Goals is 12 years away. It's only a milestone. It is the bull's-eye
that we need to go through and zoom ourselves towards transformations where we can have a good future
for all co-citizens on earth, nine billion plus, within a stable earth system
in 2050 and beyond. 03:50This is a quest, and in order to really explore this
and not have only opinions about it, we gathered the scientific community,
the best thinkers and modelers and started to develop a completely
new complex systems dynamic model, the Earth-3 model, building on models that have been around
for the last 50 years. And here it is. This is a fantastic piece of work. This has a climate module, a biosphere
module, a global economic model; it has algorithms, it has the whole room
of fantastic accomplishments. This is what turns us scientists on. 04:24(Laughter) 04:25I mean, this is just
a beautiful piece of work? And I'd just love to spend the whole
evening walking this through with you, but I'll make you disappointed. I cannot do that. In fact, the only thing I can do with you
is just to assure you that this is the first time it's done. Nobody has ever tried
to really analytically combine the Sustainable Development Goals
with planetary boundaries. And we were able to find patterns
and really convergent trends that gives us a lot of confidence
in our ability to now project economic development, resources use from water, food and energy, population growth, income per person, yet along these consistent
and systemic pathways. So, it's the first time we have
a robust opportunity to really explore the futures of ability
of attaining the SDGs within PBs. 05:14Now, how do we do this? Well, look at this. Here, you have the data
coming from the real world, calibrated from 1970-2015: 100,000 data points around the world, building on seven regions' ability, of really picking on all these
Sustainable Development Goals. Now, one example of how
we calibrated this, here you have [data] for
Sustainable Development Goals on eradicating poverty, health,
education and food. And here you have in the bubbles
the seven regions of the world, how they move up until 2015
in our empirical observations in relation to GDP per capita, giving these universal convergent trends, which enabled us to create regressions that could make us able to do
simulations into the future, all the way until 2050, showing the ability along
the lines here to attain the SDGs. 06:06Now, this gave us the opportunity
of doing several scenarios, testing different possible futures: business as usual, global transformations, investment schemes in business,
different governance options, policies, finance -- really, to explore what
the future can look like in our ability to attain
the SDGs within PBs. And the results, I can tell you,
really surprised us. And this will be
the first time it's shown. It should actually not even
be referenced outside of this room. 06:37Now, it actually is presented
along two axes. The y-axis here shows our ability
to stay within planetary boundaries. The higher up, the closer you are
to the safe operating space. On the x-axis are
the Sustainable Development Goals; the further to the right,
the more of the SDGs we fulfill. We all want to be in
the upper right-hand corner, the safe and just world for the future. Now, the point you see there is 1980. We were in a situation where we actually
were in a safe operating space but not meeting so many of the SDGs. Here's the trend up until 2015. So this is the conventional world, which is actually delivering
on an increasing number of SDGs, lifting millions of people out of poverty, but doing it at the expense
of the safe operating space on earth. 07:23Now, this is the scenario
business as usual, into the future. If we just move on as today, we will be able to deliver
on some of the SDGs, but we'll do it at the expense
of the stability of the earth system. Now, what if we go faster
on economic growth and really ally on one percent
increase per year of income and an even tripling
of the world economy by 2050? That would give us
the following trajectory. We would, yes, go a little bit further
on SDG accomplishments, but still at the expense of the risk
of destabilizing the planet. But what if we really go harder? What if we increase our ability
to deliver on our promises by 30 percent across all sectors in society, from climate to our trade agreements? A harder scenario would take us
a little bit better, but still, we're failing on the SDGs, and we are not accomplishing
a safe operating space for humanity. 08:22So this really led us to a quite
disappointing conclusion, that we will actually, even if we go
conventional futures, fail on the SDGs and transgress planetary boundaries. We need some radical thinking. We need to go into
a transformative, disruptive future, where we start thinking
outside of the box. The modeling and engagement
and dialogues enable us to identify five transformations that could
actually potentially take us there. 08:50The first one is to cut emissions
by half every decade along the scientific pathway to Paris, doubling investments in renewable energy, creating a global energy democracy, allowing us to meet several of the SDGs. 09:04The second is a rapid shift
towards sustainable food systems, investing one percent per year
in sustainable intensification and really moving towards implementing
and investing in solutions that we already have available today. 09:19The third is really to shift
our development paradigm and learn from many
of the developing countries that have moved very fast. What if we could have
an economic growth such as in China, while doing it within
the environmental parameters of an ecological civilization? 09:35Fourth, a redistribution of wealth. What if we could [agree]
that the richest 10 percent could not allow themselves to amass
more than 40 percent, maximum, of national incomes -- a drastic redistribution of wealth, reforming the ability
of equity across regions? 09:51And finally, fifth, a radical increase
in more education, health, access to work, contraception, investing largely in women
across the world, allowing us to deliver on SDGs
on gender, inequality, economics and urban development. 10:08Now, if we would push ourselves
across all these five -- we tested this, and it would give us
an amazing journey towards the safe and just
operating space on earth. It shows us that even with
a conservative, empirically based, complex system dynamics model, we are at a state where we can
actually think of transformations over the next 12 years and beyond that can take us up into
the safe operating space and deliver on aspirational
social and economic goals. This is actually quite uplifting, despite the fact that we're
not moving along this trajectory. 10:46So, in summary: we now, three years into
the operational delivery on the SDGs, must draw a line and conclude that we're not
delivering on our promises, and not only that, we're running the risks of future generations having
an even tougher ability, because of the risk of pushing
the earth system beyond tipping points. In fact, we are facing even
a risk of a hothouse earth, where we will undermine
and create geopolitical instabilities that could actually make life
even more tough for billions of people on earth. This, in all honesty,
really, really scares me. 11:23But that's also why
I'm standing here tonight, because the window
of success is still open. The earth system is still resilient. She is still providing us
with ecosystem services and functions that can allow us a transition
back into a safe operating space. But we need radically different thinking. We need to see this
as an incredible wake-up call but also an opportunity
for transformative change, where we shift gears and really start thinking
of the SDGs as a transformative agenda within a safe operating space on earth. In other words, we can build
a safe and just world. We just have to really,
really get on with it. And let's do it. Thank you. 12:05(Applause)"
2,How to transform sinking cities into landscapes that fight floods,Kotchakorn Voraakhom,Jan 2019,"From London to Tokyo, climate change is causing cities to sink -- and our modern concrete infrastructure is making us even more vulnerable to severe flooding, says landscape architect and TED Fellow Kotchakorn Voraakhom.

across the globe are sinking, including New York, London, Tokyo, Shanghai, New Orleans, and as well as my city, Bangkok. Here is the usual version
of climate change. This is mine. Nothing much, just a crocodile on the street. 00:33(Laughter) 00:35This is an urgent impact
of climate change: over sinking cities. Here, you can see
the urbanization of Bangkok, growing in every direction, shifting from porous, agricultural land -- the land that can breathe
and absorb water -- to a concrete jungle. This is what parts of it look like
after 30 minutes of rainfall. And every time it rains, I wish my car could turn into a boat. This land has no room for water. It has lost its absorbent capacity. 01:22footnotefootnoteThe reality of Bangkok's
metropolitan region is a city of 15 million people living, working and commuting
on top of a shifting, muddy river delta. Bangkok is sinking
more than one centimeter per year, which is four times faster
than the rate of predicted sea level rise. And we could be below sea level by 2030, which will be here too soon. 02:00There is no coincidence that I am here
as a landscape architect. As a child, I grew up in a row house next to the busy road
always filled with traffic. In front of my house,
there was a concrete parking lot, and that was my playground. The only living creature I would find, and had fun with, were these sneaky little plants
trying to grow through the crack of the concrete pavement. My favorite game with friends was to dig a bigger
and bigger hole through this crack to let this little plant creep out -- sneak out more and more. And yes, landscape architecture gives me the opportunity
to continue my cracking ambition -- 03:02(Laughter) 03:03to connect this concrete land
back to nature. 03:10Before, Thais -- my people -- we were adapted to the cycle
of the wet and dry season, and you could call us amphibious. 03:22(Laughter) 03:23We lived both on land and on water. We were adapted to both. And flooding was a happy event,
when the water fertilized our land. But now, flooding means ... disaster. 03:42footnotefootnoteIn 2011, Thailand was hit by the most damaging
and the most expensive flood disaster in our history. Flooding has turned central Thailand
into an enormous lake. Here, you can see the scale of the flood
in the center of the image, to the scale of Bangkok,
outlined in yellow. The water was overflowing from the north, making its way across several provinces. Millions of my people, including me and my family, were displaced and homeless. Some had to escape the city. Many were terrified of losing
their home and their belongings, so they stayed back in the flood
with no electricity and clean water. 04:43For me, this flood reflects clearly that our modern infrastructure, and especially our notion
of fighting flood with concrete, had made us so extremely vulnerable
to the climate uncertainty. But in the heart of this disaster, I found my calling. I cannot just sit and wait
as my city continues to sink. The city needed me, and I had the ability to fix this problem. 05:22Six years ago, I started my project. My teams and I won the design competition
for Chulalongkorn Centenary Park. This was the big, bold mission
of the first university in Thailand for celebrating its hundredth anniversary by giving this piece of land
as a public park to our city. Having a park sounds very normal
to many other cities, but not in Bangkok, which has one of the lowest
public green space per capita among megacities in Asia. Our project's become
the first new public park in almost 30 years. The 11-acre park -- a big green crack
at the heart of Bangkok -- opened just last year. 06:26(Applause and cheers) 06:28Thank you. 06:29(Applause) 06:33For four years, we have pushed
through countless meetings to convince and never
give up to convincing that this park isn't just
for beautification or recreation: it must help the city deal with water, it must help the city
confront climate change. 06:53And here is how it works. Bangkok is a flat city, so we harnessed the power of gravity
by inclining the whole park to collect every drop of rain. The gravity force pulls down
the runoff from the highest point to the lowest point. This park has three main elements
that work as one system. The first -- the green roof. This is the biggest
green roof in Thailand, with the rainwater tanks
and museum underneath. In the dry season, the collected rain can be used
to water the park for up to a month. The runoff on the green roof
then falls through wetlands with the native water plants
that can help filter and help clean water. And at the lower end, the retention pond
collects all of the water. 07:57At this pond, there are water bikes. People can pedal and help clean water. Their exercise becomes an active part
of the park water system. When life gives you a flood, you have fun with the water. 08:17(Laughter) 08:20Centenary Park gives room for people
and room for water, which is exactly
what we and our cities need. This is an amphibious design. This park is not
about getting rid of flood. It's about creating a way to live with it. And not a single drop of rain
is wasted in this park. This park can hold and collect
a million gallons of water. 08:56(Applause) 08:58Thank you. 08:59(Applause) 09:03Every given project, for me,
is an opportunity to create more green cracks
through this concrete jungle by using landscape architecture
as a solution, like turning this concrete roof
into an urban farm, which can help absorb rain; reduce urban heat island and grow food in the middle of the city; reuse the abandoned concrete structure to become a green pedestrian bridge; and another flood-proof park
at Thammasat University, which nearly completes the biggest
green roof on an academic campus yet in Southeast Asia. 09:54Severe flooding is our new normal, putting the southeast Asian region -- the region with the most coastline -- at extreme risk. Creating a park is just one solution. The awareness of climate change means we, in every profession
we are involved, are increasingly obligated
to understand the climate risk and put whatever we are working on
as part of the solution. Because if our cities continue the way they are now, a similar catastrophe
will happen again ... and again. 10:49Creating a solution
in these sinking cities is like making the impossible possible. And for that, I would like to share one word
that I always keep in mind, that is, ""tangjai."" The literal translation
for ""tang"" is ""to firmly stand,"" and ""jai"" means ""heart."" Firmly stand your heart at your goal. In Thai language,
when you commit to do something, you put tangjai in front of your word, so your heart will be in your action. No matter how rough the path, how big the crack, you push through to your goal, because that's where your heart is. 11:52And yes, Thailand is home. This land is my only home, and that's where I firmly stand my heart. Where do you stand yours? 12:09Thank you. 12:11(Applause) 12:12Thank you. 12:13Kòp kun ka. 12:14(Applause and cheers)"

Bill Gates calls himself
an imperfect messenger on climate because of his high
carbon footprint and lifestyle. However, he has just made
a major contribution to our thinking about confronting
climate change via a book, a book about decarbonising
our economy and society. It's an optimistic ""can-do"" kind of book with a strong focus
on technological solutions. He discusses the things we have,
such as wind and solar power, the things we need to develop, such as carbon-free cement
or carbon-free steel, and long-term energy storage. And he talks about
the economics of it all, introducing the concept of green premium. The gist of the book,
and really I'm simplifying here a lot, is that fighting climate change
is going to be hard, but it's possible, we can do it. There is a pathway to a clean
and prosperous future for all. So we want to unpack some of that
with the author of the book. Bill Gates, welcome back to TED. 01:10Bill Gates: Thank you. 01:11Giussani: Bill, I would like to start
where you start, from the title of the book. ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,"" which, of course, presumes that we are heading towards
a climate disaster if we don't act differently. So what is the single
most important thing we must do to avoid a climate disaster? 01:28footnotefootnoteGates: Well, the greenhouse gases
we put into the atmosphere, particularly CO2, stay there for thousands of years. And so it's really the sum
of all those emissions are forcing the temperature
higher and higher, which will have disastrous effects. And so we have to take these emissions, which are presently
over 51 billion tons per year and drive those all the way down to zero. And that's when the temperature
will stop increasing and the disastrous weather events
won't get worse and worse. So it's pretty demanding. It's not a 50 percent reduction. It's all the way down to zero. 02:13Giussani: Now, 51 billion is a big number. It's difficult to register, to understand. Help us visualize the scale
of the problem. 02:23footnotefootnoteGates: Well, the key is to understand
all the different sources. And people are mostly aware
of the production of electricity with natural gas and coal
as being a big source. That's about 27 percent. And they're somewhat
aware of transportation, including passenger cars. Passenger cars are seven percent
and transportation overall is 16 percent. They have far less awareness
of the other three segments. Agriculture, which is 19 percent, heating and cooling buildings, including using natural gas,
are seven percent. And then, sadly, the biggest segment
of all, manufacturing, including steel and cement. People are least aware of that one. And in fact, that one is the most
difficult for us to solve. The size of all the steel plants, cement plants, paper, plastic, the industrial economy is gigantic. And we're asking that to be changed over
in this 30-year period when we don't even know
how to make that change right now. 03:36Giussani: So your core argument,
and really, here I’m simplifying, is that basically we need
to clean up all of that, right? The way we make things, we grow things, we get around and power our economy. And so to do that,
we need to get to a point where green energy
is as cheap as fossil fuels, and new materials, clean materials,
are as cheap as current materials. And you call that ""eliminating
the green premium."" So to start, tell us what you mean
by green premium. 04:03Gates: Yeah, so the green premium varies
from emission sources. It's the cost to buy that product where there's been no emissions
versus the cost we have today. And so for an electric car, the green premium is reasonably modest. You pay a little more upfront, you save a bit on the maintenance
and gasoline, you give up some range, you have a longer charging time. But over the next 15 years, because the volume is there
and the R and D is being done, we can expect that the electric car
will be preferable. It won't cost more. It will have a much higher range. And so that green premium
that today is about 15 percent is headed to be zero even without any government subsidies. And so that's magic. That's exactly what we need to do
for every other category. 05:02Now, an area like cement, where we haven't really
gotten started yet, the green premium today
is almost double the price. That is, you pay 125 dollars
for a ton of cement today but it would be almost double that
if you insisted that it be green cement. And so the way I think of this is in 2050 we'll be talking to India
and saying to them, ""Please use the green products as you're building basic shelter,
you know, simple air conditioning,"" which they'll need
because of the heat increase or lighting at night for students. And unless we're willing to subsidize it
or the price is very low, they'll say, ""No, this is a problem
that the rich countries created, that India is suffering from and you need to take care of it."" So only by bringing that green premium
down very dramatically, about 95 percent across all categories, will that conversation go well so that India can make that shift. 06:12And so the key thing here is that the US's responsibility
is not just to zero out its emissions. That's a very hard thing, but we're only 15 percent. Unless we, through our power
of innovation, make it so cheap for all countries
to switch all categories, then we simply aren't going to get there. And so the US really has to step up and use all of this innovative capacity
every year for the next 30 years. 06:46Giussani: What what needs to happen in order for these breakthroughs
to actually occur? Who are the players
who need to come together? 06:55Gates: Well, innovation usually happens
at a pace of its own. Here we have this deadline, 2050. And so we have to do
everything we can to accelerate it. We need to raise the R and D
budgets in these areas. In 2015 I organized, along
with President Hollande and Obama, a side event to the Paris climate talks where what Prime Minister Modi
had labeled ""mission innovation"" was a commitment to double R and D budgets
over a five-year period. And all the big countries
came in and made that pledge. Then we need lots of smart people, who, instead of working on other problems, are encouraged to work on these problems. So coming up with funding for them
is very, very important. I'm doing some of that through what I call
Breakthrough Energy Fellows. We need high-risk capital
to invest in these companies, even though the risks are very, very high. And that's -- There is now -- Breakthrough Energy Ventures
is one group doing that and drawing lots of other people in. 08:09But then the most difficult thing is we actually need markets
for these products even when they start out
being more expensive. And that's what I call Catalyst, organizing the buying power of consumers
and companies and governments so that we get on the learning curve, get the scale going up, like we did with solar and wind
across all these categories. So it's both supply of innovation
and demand for the green products. That's the combination that can start us to make
this change to the infrastructure of the entire physical economy. 08:53Giussani: In terms of funding all this, the financial system as a whole right now is essentially funding
expansion of fossil fuels consistent with three degrees Celsius
increase in global heating. What do you say to the Finance Committee, beyond the venture capital, about the need to think
and act differently? 09:15footnotefootnoteGates: Well, if you look
at the interest rates for a solar field versus any other type
of investments, it's not lower. You know, money is very fungible. It's going to, you know,
different projects. But, there's no, sort of, special rate
for climate-related projects. Now, you know, governments can decide through tax incentives
to improve those things. But you know, this is not just
about reporting numbers. It's good to report numbers. But the steel industry
is providing a vital service. Even gasoline, for 98 percent of the cars
being purchased today, allows people to get to their job. And so, you know, just divestment alone
is not going to be the thing that creates the new alternative and brings the cost of that down. So the finance side will be important
because the speed of deployment -- Solar and wind needs to be
accelerated dramatically beyond anything we've done today. In fact, you know, on average, we'll have to deploy three times as much
every year as the peak year so far. And so those are a key part
of the solution. They're not the whole solution. But you know, people sometimes think
just by putting numbers, disclosing numbers, that somehow it all changes or by divesting that it all changes. The financial sector is important, but without the innovation, there's nothing they can do. 10:57Giussani: A lot of the current focus is on
cutting emissions by half by 2030 and on the way to reaching
that zero by 2050. And in the book, you write that there is danger
in that kind of thinking, that we should keep
our main focus on 2050. Can you explain that? 11:15Gates: Well, the only real measure
of how well we’re doing is the green premium, because that's what determines whether India and other
developing countries will choose to use
the zero emission approach in 2050. The idea, you know -- If you're focusing
on short-term reductions, then you could say, oh, it's fantastic, we just put billions of dollars
into natural-gas plants. And even ignoring
that there's a lot of leakage that doesn't get properly measured, you know, give them full credit
and say that's a 50 percent reduction. The lifetime of that plant
is greater than 30 years. You financed it, assuming you're getting value out of it
over a longer period of time. So to say, ""Hey, hallelujah, we switched from coal to natural gas,"" that has nothing to do with reaching zero. It sets you back because of the capital
spending involved there. And so it's not a path to zero if you're just working
on the easy parts of the emission. That's not a path. The path is to take
every source of emission and say, ""Oh, my goodness, how am I going to get
that green premium down? How am I going to get
that green premium down?"" Otherwise, getting to 50 percent
does not stop the problems. This is very tough
because the nature is zero. It's not just, you know, a small decrease. 12:44Giussani: So getting 
the green premium down, so you mentioned India. To make sure that the transition,
the clean transition, is also an Indian story
and an African story and not only a Western story, should rich countries adopt
the expensive clean alternatives now, to kind of buy down the green premium and make technology, therefore,
more accessible to low-income countries? 13:09Gates: Absolutely. You have to pick which product paths with scale will become
low green-premium products. And so you don't want to just randomly
pick things that are low-emission. You have to pick things
that will come down. So like, you know, so far,
hydrogen fuel cells have not done that. Now they might in the future. Solar, wind and lithium-ion, we've seen these incredible
cost reductions. And so we have to duplicate that
for other areas, things like offshore wind, heat pump, new ways of doing transmission. You know, we have to keep
the electricity grid reliable, even in very bad weather conditions. And so that's where storage
or nuclear and transmission will have to be scaled up
in a very significant way, which we now have this open-source
model to look at that. And so the buying of green products
that demand signal, what I call Catalyst, we're going to have
to orchestrate a lot of money, many tens of billions of dollars for that, that is one of the most expensive pieces so that the improvements come
in these other areas and some of them we haven't
even gotten started on. 14:34Giussani: Many people believe actually
that the climate question is mostly a question of consuming less
and particularly consuming less energy. And in the book,
you actually write several times that we need to consume more energy. Why? 14:48Gates: Well, the basic living conditions
that we take for granted should be made available to all humans. And the human population is growing. And so you're going -- as you provide shelter,
heating and air conditioning, which anywhere near the equator
will be more in demand since you'll have many days
where you can't go outdoors at all. So we're not going to stop making shelter. We're not going to stop making food. And so we need to be able to multiply
those processes by zero. That is, you make shelter,
but there's no emissions. You make food, but there's no emissions. That's how you get
all the way down to zero. Now, it's made somewhat easier
if rich countries are consuming less, but how far will that go? 15:44Giussani: So if I summarize
in my head your book, you are basically suggesting
that if we eliminate the green premium, the transition somehow can occur, the cost and technology, green premium and breakthroughs
are the key drivers. But, you know, you think of climate
and climate is kind of a wicked problem. It has implications that are social,
political, behavioral. It requires significant
citizen involvement. Are you focusing too much on tech
and not enough on those other variables? 16:12Gates: Well, we need all these things. If you don't have a deep engagement, particularly by the younger generation making this a top priority every year
for the next 30 years across all the developed countries, we will not succeed. And I'm not the one who knows
how to activate all those people. I’m super glad that the people
who are smart about that are thinking. It's a necessary element. Likewise, the piece
that I do have experience in, innovation ecosystems, that's a necessary element. You will not get there just by saying,
""Please stop using steel."" You know, it won't happen. And so the innovation piece
has to come along and particularly encouraging consumers
to buy electric cars or artificial meat or electric heat pumps, they're part of driving that demand, what I call the catalytic demand. That alone won't do it,
because some of these big projects, like green hydrogen or green aviation fuel require billions in capital expense. But the demand signal from enlightened
consumers is very important. Their political voice is very important. Their pushing the companies
they work at is very important. And so I absolutely agree that the broad
community who cares about this, particularly if they understand
how hard it is and don't say, ""Oh, we can do it in 10 years,"" they are super important. 17:55Giussani: You mentioned artificial meat
and I know you love burgers. Have you tried an artificial burger,
and how did you find it? 18:02Gates: Yes, I’m an investor in all these
Impossible, Beyond and various people. And I have to say, the progress in that sector
is greater than I expected. Five years ago, I would have said that is as hard
as manufacturing. Now it's very hard,
but not as hard as manufacturing. There is no Impossible Foods
of green steel and the quality is going
to keep improving. It's quite good today. You know, there's other companies
coming in to that space covering different types of food. And as the volume goes up,
the price will go down. And so I think it's quite promising. I have to admit, 100 percent
of my burgers aren't artificial yet, it's about 50 percent, but I'll get there. 18:54Giussani: It’s a start. You're already on 2030
on that on that front. So you mentioned
your expertise in innovation. You have a couple of lines of --
how to say it? -- of exquisite modesty in the book where you say you think like an engineer, you don't know much about politics, but actually you talk to top politicians
more than any of us. What do you ask them
and what do you hear in return? 19:17Gates: Well, they’re mostly responding
to voters interest. Most of the countries
we're talking about are democracies. And you know, there are resources
that will need to be put in like tax credits that encourage
buying green products or government purchasing of green products at slightly higher prices. Those are real trade-offs. And, you know, making sure that the areas where there's lots of jobs in, say, coal mining, or things where the demand will go down, having that political sensitivity
and thinking through, can we put the new jobs in that area and what are the departments 
that handle that. This is a tough political problem. And, you know, my admonition to people
is not only to get educated themselves, but help educate other people. And often, like in the US, if it's people of both parties,
that's even better. The level of interest is high, but it needs to get even higher, almost like a moral mission
of all young people to go beyond their individual success, that they believe that getting to zero
by 2050 is critical. 20:43Giussani: Thank you. Now, before we continue the interview, I would like to take
a short detour for one minute because my colleagues at TED-Ed
have produced a series of seven animated videos
inspired by your book. They introduce the concept
of net zero emissions, they discuss other questions
and challenges that we are facing relating to climate. So I would like to share one short clip
from one of those animations. 21:11(Video) You flip a switch, coal burns in a furnace
which turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine which activates a generator which pushes electrons through the wire. This current propagates through hundreds
of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people
are doing this every second: flipping a switch, plugging in,
pressing an ""on"" button. So how much electricity
does humanity need? 21:45Giussani: The answer to that and to many 
other climate questions, of course, is in the seven animations
available on the TED-Ed site, and the TED-Ed YouTube channel. 21:54Bill, you mentioned
the younger generation before. How does the younger generation's role
in solving this problem inspire you? 22:03Gates: Well, they ... can make sure this is a priority. And if we have, you know,
it's a priority for four years, then it's not for four years, you can't ask the trillions
of investment in the new approach to take place. It's got to be pretty clear that even though political parties
may disagree on the tactics, the same way they agree
there should be a strong defense that they agree this zero by 2050
is a shared goal, and then discuss, OK,
where does government come in, where does the private sector come in, which area deserves priority? That will be a huge milestone where it’s a discussion
about how to get there versus whether to get there. And the US is the most fraught
in terms of it being politicized, even in terms of,
is this a huge problem or not. So, you know, young people, they're going to be around
to see the good news if we're able to achieve this. You know, I won't be around. But, they speak with moral authority and they have particular people
who are stepping up on this. But I hope that's just the beginning. And that's why this year,
I think, is so important. All this recovery money being programed, people thinking about, do governments
protect us the way they should, do governments work together? You know, the pandemic
has teed this up, it’s OK, what's the next big problem
we need to collaborate around? And I'm hoping that climate appears there because of these activists. 23:58Giussani: Yeah, we ought to come back
to the pandemic question. But I want to talk a moment about some
specific technology breakthroughs that you mention in the book. But you also just mentioned the organization you set up,
Breakthrough Energy, to invest in clean tech start-up
and advocate for policies. And I assume somehow
your book is kind of a blueprint for what Breakthrough Energy
is going to do. There is a branch in that organization, called Catalyst, that's prioritizing several technologies, including green hydrogen
direct carbon-capture, aviation biofuels. I don't want to ask you
about specific investments, but I would like to ask you
to describe why those priorities, maybe starting with green hydrogen. 24:39Gates: If we can get green hydrogen
that’s very cheap, and we don't know that we can, that becomes a magic ingredient
to a lot of processes that lets you make fertilizer
without using natural gas, it lets you reduce iron ore
for steel production without using any form of coal. And so there's two ways to make it. You can take water and split it
into hydrogen and oxygen. You can take natural gas
and pull out the hydrogen. And so it's kind of a holy grail, you know, and so we need to get going. We need to get all the components
to be very, very cheap. And only by actually doing projects,
significant scale projects, do you get on to that learning curve. And so Catalyst will fund the early pilot projects along with governments
to go make green hydrogen, get the electrolyzers to get up in volume and get a lot cheaper, because that would be a huge advance. Lot of manufacturing, not all of it,
but a lot of it would be solved with that. 26:04Giussani: So just for those 
who don’t know, green hydrogen is produced
with clean energy sources, wind, solar and so, nitrogen produced from natural gas
or fossil gas is called gray hydrogen. The second priority that you have set
is direct carbon capture, pulling carbon from the atmosphere. And at least in theory, we can find a way to do that
at large scale. Together with other technologies
the problem could be solved, but it's a very early-stage,
unproven technology. You describe it yourself in the book
as a thought experiment at this stage. But you are one of the main investors
in this sector in the world. So what's the real potential
for direct carbon capture? 26:47footnotefootnoteGates: So there’s a company
today, Climeworks, that for a bit over 600 dollars
a ton will do capture. Now it’s at fairly small scale. I'm a customer of theirs
as part of my program where I eliminate all
of my carbon emissions in a gold standard way. There are other people
who are trying to do larger-scale plants like Carbon Engineering. Breakthrough Energy is investing in a number of these
carbon-capture entities. In a way, the carbon capture
is for the part that you can't solve any other way. It's kind of the brute-force piece, and no one knows what that price will be. If it's 100 dollars a ton, then the cost against current emissions
would be five trillion a year. Can we get below 100 dollars a ton? It's not clear that we can, but it would be fantastic
to take the final 10, 15 percent of emissions, and instead of making the change at the place where
the emission takes place, just do this, direct air capture. To be clear, direct air capture
means you're just filtering the air, and you're pulling out the 410 million
current parts per million and putting that into
a pressurized form of CO2 that then you sequester in someplace that you know it'll stay
for millions of years. And so this industry is just
at the very, very beginning. But it's a necessary piece
for the tail of emissions. 28:31Giussani: And a third priority
is aviation biofuels. Now flying over the last several years has become a symbol
of a polluting lifestyle, let's say. Why aviation biofuels as a priority? 28:43Gates: Well, the great thing
about passenger cars is that even though batteries
don't store energy as well as gasoline does, there's dramatic difference, you can afford to have the extra size
and weight of those batteries. On a plane that is a large plane
going a long distance, there's no chance that batteries
will ever have that energy density. I mean, there's some crazy people
who are working on it, and I'll be glad to fund them, but you wouldn't want to count on that. And so you either have to use
hydrogen as a plane fuel, that has certain challenges, or you just want to make today's
aviation fuel with green processes, like using plants as the source
of how you make those. And so I'm the biggest individual customer of a group that makes green aviation fuel. So that's what I'm using now, costs over twice as much
as the normal aviation fuel. But as the demand scales up, that's one of those green premiums
that we hope to bring down so that at some point
lots of consumers will say, ""Yes, I'll pay a little extra
on my plane ticket,"" probably through Catalyst
or through the airline to make sure that we're
building up that industry and trying to get the costs,
that green premium down quite a bit. So this is a super important area that, you know, I was amazed when I went to buy that I was by far the biggest
individual customer. 30:38Giussani: It’s also, of course,
a very symbolic area, right? People think of cars
and think of airplanes when they think of pollution
and emissions. There is a fourth technology
that I want to bring up because you are an advocate of
and an investor in nuclear power, which is also not universally accepted
as clean energy because of the risks, because of radioactive waste. Can you make the case, briefly,
but can you make your case for nuclear? 31:04Gates: Well, one thing
that needs to be appreciated is that energy has to come from somewhere. And so as you stop using
natural gas to heat homes and gasoline to power cars, the electric grid
will have to grow dramatically. And even in the case of the US, where electricity demand has been flat
the last few decades, will need to be almost
three times as large. As you do that with
weather-dependent sources, the reliability of the electricity
generation goes away, that as you get big cold fronts that for 10 days can stop
most of the wind and solar, say, in the Midwest. So the question is, how do you use
massive amounts of transmission and storage and non weather-dependent
sources which at scale nuclear as the only choice there, to maintain that reliability and not have people, say,
freeze to death. And nuclear -- People will be pretty impressed
with how valuable it is to create that reliability. Now, 80 percent, at least in the US,
will be wind and solar. So we have to build that faster than ever. But what is that piece that's always
available is where nuclear would fit in. 32:33Giussani: Now, you talk a lot about 
scaling up technologies in the book. I want to ask you a question
about scaling down, because one thing
that's absent from your book is a discussion about scaling down
fossil fuel production, maybe starting with at least
not expanding it anymore, with adopting a sort of fossil fuel
nonproliferation approach, because right now we are talking
about a green transition, but at the same time we are building out
further fossil fuel infrastructure. What's your view on that? 33:01Gates: Well, it’s all
about the demand for fossil fuels and the fact that the green
premium is very high. If you want to restrict supply, then you'll just drive the price up. People still want to drive to their job. If you know, say you made
fossil fuels illegal. You know, try that for a few weeks. My view is you have to create a substitute because the services provided
by the fossil fuel are actually quite valuable. Electricity is valuable. Transportation is valuable. And are you willing to drop demand
for those things to zero? So the capitalistic
economy will respond. If it's clear, you know, how you're going to do
your tax policies and your credit, you're going to drive innovation, then the infrastructure investments
in those things will go down. We see that with coal already today. But ... Just speaking against something
when you haven't created an alternative isn't going to get you to zero. 34:15Giussani: OK, I want to shift topics. You mentioned before the pandemic, and your main focus since you set up
the Gates Foundation has been on global health. I actually read the letter, the annual letter you wrote
with your wife, Melinda, in January 2021, which was very much
about the COVID-19 pandemic. And I found myself marveling at how what you write resonates
with the climate challenge. What lessons from the pandemic
can be actually applied to climate? 34:42Gates: Well I think the biggest lesson
is that governments got to, on our behalf, avoid disastrous future outcomes. And individual citizens aren't equipped
to either do those evaluations or think through that R and D
and deployment plan that's necessary here. And so we have to make it an imperative that governments, hopefully of any party, join in to this. The pandemic, we did eventually
get global cooperation. The US didn't play its normal role there, but the private sector innovation
created the vaccine. Now, sadly, with climate, the pain it's causing
gets worse over time. So with the pandemic,
we had all these deaths, and people were like, ""Wow, OK,
we should do something."" With climate you can't wait. You know, the coral reefs
will have died off, the species will be gone. And so if you say, ""OK, well,
let's, when it gets bad, we'll invent something like a vaccine."" That doesn't work, because to stop the emissions, you have to change every
steel plant, cement plant, car, things that have massive lead times and literally trillions
of dollars of investment. And so with the pandemic, we messed up. We didn't pay attention. You know, people like myself
said it was a problem. But, now we're getting
our way out of it through innovation. But climate's harder, much harder problem. And so the political will to get it right needs to be unprecedented compared to the pandemic
or almost any other political cause. 36:36Giussani: I want to correct you 
about private-sector innovation, because, of course, a lot of public money
went into funding research and guaranteed purchases. And so for the vaccines. But that's a separate interview. 36:49Gates: Well, the Pfizer vaccine
used no government money. 36:52Giussani: That’s absolutely true. Bill, still related to our reaction
to these big challenges, over half of the total
greenhouse gas emissions since 2017, 50 or 51 have gone up in the atmosphere
in the last 30 years. And we have known for more than 30 years
that they have pernicious effects, to say the least. So if we could mobilize
such enormous resources and policies and collaborations and global
collaborations against COVID-19, what's the lever we can use to mobilize
the same against climate? 37:24Gates: Well, until 2015, nobody pushed
for the R and D budgets to go up. So, you know, there are times when I think ""Wow, are we serious, are we not?"" You know, that R and D question
just wasn't discussed. And you could read
every paper on green steel and there were hardly any. And so we are just starting
to get serious about climate. And you know, we've wasted a lot of time that we should have used to work
on the hard parts of climates, just having short-term goals
and not focusing on the R and D piece, you know, the last 20 years, we don't have much to show
for the hard categories. Now, there's still time to get there. We will have to fund
adaptation a great deal because the 2050 goal
is not because that's a goal that gives you zero damage. It's simply the goal
that is the most ambitious that has a chance of being achieved. And we are causing problems
for subsistence farmers and sea-level rise and wildfires
and natural ecosystems. And so the adaptation side
is even more underfunded than the mitigation side. For example, helping poor farmers with seeds that can deal with the droughts
and high temperatures is funded at less than a billion a year, which is deeply tragic. 39:03Giussani: Bill, we’re getting towards 
the end. I mentioned at the beginning, in the book you describe yourself
as an imperfect messenger on climate. What changes have you made
in your personal and family life to reduce your footprint? 39:16Gates: Well, I’m certainly
driving an electric car, you know, putting solar panels
on the houses where that makes sense. Using this green aviation fuel, I still can't say
that I've stopped eating meat or that I never fly. And so it's mostly by funding
at over seven million a year the products that although their green
premiums are very high today, like the carbon capture
or like the aviation fuel, by funding those, you actually
get those on to the learning curve to get those prices down
very dramatically. One area that I do is I fund putting in electric heat-pumps
into low-cost housing. And so instead of using natural gas, they get a lower bill
because it's done with electricity. And I paid that extra
capital cost as an offset. So, you know, accelerating
those demand things. I've tried to get out in front of that. 40:28Giussani: You also talk in the book
about paying more than market value or the current market price for offsets, and you hinted to them before,
talking about the golden standard. Tell us about what kind of -- offsets can be kind of confusing
and controversial. What are the right offsets? 40:49Gates: Well, first of all, it’s great
that we’re finally talking about offsets, and any company that actually
looks at their emissions and pays for offsets is way better than a company that either
doesn't look at their emissions or looks at them
and doesn't pay for offsets. And so the leading companies
are now buying offsets, some of them spending
hundreds of millions to buy offsets. That is a very, very good thing. The ability to see which offsets
actually have long-term benefit that really keep the carbon out for the over thousands
of years that count. There are now organizations
that I and others are funding to label offsets as either gold standard or different levels of impact. And the price of offsets range
from 15 dollars a ton to 600 dollars a ton. Some of the low-cost ones
may be really legitimate, like reducing natural gas leakage. That is pretty dramatic in some cases in terms of the dollars
per tons avoided there. A lot of the forestry things will probably
not end up looking that good, as you really look
at the lifetime of the tree or what would have happened otherwise. But, you know, at least
we're talking about offsets now. And now we're going to do it
in a thoughtful way. 42:23Giussani: So some of the people
listening to this interview may already be very involved with climate, others may be looking for ways to step up. And at the end of your book, you have a chapter
about individual action. Give us maybe, say, two examples, two practical examples of things
that individual citizens in the US, but also elsewhere, can do to play a meaningful role
in tackling climate change. 42:47Gates: I think everybody should start
by learning more, you know. How much steel do we make
and where are those steel plants? The industrial economy
is kind of a miracle, although sadly, it's a source
of so many emissions. Once you really educate yourself, then you're in a position
to educate others, hopefully, of diverse political beliefs about why this is so important. And yet it's also very, very hard to do. You have all your buying behavior, electric cars, artificial meat, you know, and you'll see for all
the different products various things that indicate
how green that product is. And your demand doesn't just
save those emissions, it also encourages the improvement
of the green product. Political voice,
I'd still put it number one. Making sure your company
is measuring its emissions and is starting to fund offsets and is willing to be a customer for breakthrough storage solutions or green aviation fuel. That is catalytic. And a lot of those funds hopefully
will go through this vehicle that's really identifying
which projects globally are technologies that won't stay expensive but can do like what solar and wind did
and come down in price. So individuals are what drive this thing. The democracies are where most
of the innovation power is and they have to get activated
and set the example. 44:36Giussani: I would like to end 
on the outcome. Maybe we should have started
with the outcome, but let's imagine a world where we will actually have done all
of what you describe in the book and everything else that's necessary. What would that future
everyday life look like? 44:55Gates: Well, I think everybody
will be really proud that humanity came together
on a global basis to make this radical change and there's no precedent for it. Even world wars, where we orchestrated lots of resources, it was, like, four or five year duration. And here we're talking
about three decades of hard work dealing with an enemy that the super bad stuff
is out in the future. And so you're benefiting young people
and future generations. In some ways, you know, life will look a lot like it does today. You'll still have buildings, you'll have air conditioning,
you'll have lights at night. But all of those you'll multiply by zero in terms of what the emissions
that come out of those activities are. During the same time frame we'll have advances in medicine
of curing cancer and finishing polio and malaria
and all sorts of things. And so by taking away
this one super negative thing, then all the progress
we make in other areas won't get reduced by this awful thing that, if it goes unchecked, the migration out
of the equatorial regions, the number of deaths, it'll make the pandemic look like nothing. I think so from a moral point of view and letting the other improvements
not be offset by this. It'll be a source of great pride that, hey, we came together. 46:38Giussani: OK, let’s hope 
that we actually do. Bill Gates, thank you
for sharing your knowledge, thank you for this very,
very important book. And thank you for coming back to TED. I want to close by showing
another short clip from the TED-Ed animation series
inspired by Bill's book. This one is about material
that's all around us, has a big carbon footprint
and how to reinvent it. Now, the series includes seven videos. You can watch them all for free at

heating and cooling, makes up about six percent
of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,
accounts for 18 percent. Electricity is responsible for 27 percent. Walk outside and the cars
zipping past, planes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work. Transportation, including shipping, contributes 16 percent
of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things, making them produces emissions, a lot of emissions. Making materials, concrete,
steel, plastic, glass, aluminum and everything else accounts for 31 percent
of greenhouse gas emissions. 48:02[Watch the full animated series

in the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. 00:13They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window. 00:29The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,
and this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, 
and the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble
does the frog realize: it’s toast. 00:57What’s funny about this parable is that
it’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly
heating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,
are a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot 
and slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand
on the dial, arguing about whether we can 
trust thermometers, and questioning— 
even if they’re right, does it matter? 01:26It does. 01:28Since 1850, global average temperatures 
have risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. 01:37Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten
much warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic 
have already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures 
increase 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic
might get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai 
might get 5 degrees hotter. 02:00So how did we get here? 02:02Almost everything that makes modern life
possible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon 
from ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide 
that builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds 
or even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. 02:26The heat comes from sunlight, which passes
through the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed 
and warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,
which should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases 
don’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—
carbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases 
to the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, 
and our planet warms up. 02:58If we keep emitting greenhouse gases 
at our current pace, scientists predict temperatures
will rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer 
than today’s— as a threshold beyond which 
the negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas 
emissions down to zero as fast as possible. 03:30Or rather, we have to get emissions
down to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. 03:43This doesn’t mean we can just keep 
emitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions 
through natural methods, and technological solutions would
be prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts
of permanent storage. Instead, while we switch 
from coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, 
which will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. 04:09Jumping out of the proverbial pot 
isn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat."

Californians use more electricity
playing video games than the entire country
of Senegal uses overall. Also, before gyms
were shut down due to COVID, New Yorkers could work out
in a 10-degree-Celsius gym because the cold apparently
burns more calories. And yet only three percent of Nigerians
have air conditioners. 00:21As you can see, there's a mind-blowing gap between the energy haves
and the energy have-nots. And across the globe,
we have incredible energy inequality. Billions of people simply lack
enough energy to build a better life: affordable, abundant and reliable energy to run their businesses
without daily blackouts, to preserve their crops from rotting, to power lifesaving medical equipment, to work from home and do Zoom calls
with their colleagues, to run trains and factories, basically, to grow and to prosper and to access both dignity
and opportunity. Rich countries have that kind of energy, whereas most countries in Africa,
and many elsewhere simply don't. And those billions of people are falling further and further behind
the rest of the world. 01:09In addition to taking
their energy abundance for granted, the wealthy take
something else for granted: that everyone should fight climate change
exactly the same way. Tackling climate change will require an accelerated transition
to low-carbon energy sources. And yet, emissions continue
to climb year after year, threatening to blow
our tight carbon budget. That's what I want to talk about today. 01:32The carbon budget is an estimation
of the total emissions that our planet's atmosphere
can safely absorb. Faced with an imperative
to not explode this carbon budget, the world is looking at Africa
in a completely contradictory way. On one side, it wants us to grow, to emerge from abject poverty, to build a middle class, to own cars and air conditioners
and other modern amenities because after all,
Africa is the next global market. 01:59On the other side, because they are anxious
to demonstrate action on climate change, rich countries in the West are increasingly restricting their funding
to only renewable energy sources, effectively telling Africa
and other poor nations to either develop with no carbon or to limit their development
ambitions altogether. 02:18Africa obviously needs to develop. That's non-negotiable. And I want to make the case today
that Africa must be prioritized when it comes to what's left
in the carbon budget. In other words, Africa must be allowed to, yes, produce
more carbon in the short term so we can grow, while the rich world needs
to drastically cut their emissions. 02:38Africans have a right to aspire to the same prosperity
that everyone else enjoys. And we deserve the same chance at a job, at an education, at dignity and opportunity. We also understand very well that the entire world
needs to get to a zero-carbon future. This might sound contradictory,
but consider these three points. 03:00footnotefootnoteFirst, Africa isn't the culprit
of climate change. It's a victim. Africa and its more
than one billion people are among the most vulnerable
to climate change on the planet, facing the worst impacts
of extreme weather, drought and heat. And yet, if you look
at the carbon footprint of the entire African continent, 48 African countries combined are responsible for less than one percent
of accumulative carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Even if every one of the one billion
people in sub-Saharan Africa tripled their electricity
consumption overnight, and if all of that new power
came from natural gas-fired plants, we estimate that the additional CO2
that Africa would add would equal to just one percent
of total global emissions. 03:44Second, Africa needs more energy
to fight climate change, not less. Because of its climate vulnerability, Africa's climate fight
is about adaptation and resilience, and climate adaptation
is energy-intensive. To respond to extreme weather, Africans will need
more resilient infrastructure. We're talking seawalls, highways,
safe buildings and more. To cope with drought, Africans will need pumped irrigation
for their agriculture, and many will need desalination
for fresh water. And to survive soaring temperatures, Africans will need cold storage and ACs in hundreds of millions of homes, offices, warehouses, factories,
data centers and the like. These are all energy-intensive activities. If we fail at mitigation, the rich countries' plan B
for climate change is to simply adapt. Africans need and deserve
that same capacity for adaptation. 04:37Third, imposing mitigation on the world's poor
is widening economic inequality. We're creating energy apartheid. Working in global energy and development, I often hear people say, ""Because of climate, we just can't afford
for everyone to live our lifestyles."" That viewpoint is worse than patronizing. It's a form of racism, and it's creating a two-tier,
global energy system with energy abundance for the rich and tiny solar lamps for Africans. 05:04The global market for natural gas
is a great example of this. Large Western companies
are actively developing gas fields in African countries to run industry and generate electricity
in Asia or in Europe. And yet, when these same African countries
want to build power plants at home to use gas for their own people, the Western development
and finance communities say, ""No, we won't fund that."" 05:27And here's the irony. Many poor countries
are already far ahead of the West when it comes to transitioning
to a low-carbon energy system. In Kenya, where I'm from, we generate
most of our electricity carbon-free. Renewable sources
such as geothermal, hydro and wind provide nearly 80 percent
of our electricity. In the US, that figure is only 17 percent. 05:48So let me repeat my points. Everyone must get to a zero-carbon future. In the transition, Africa and other poor nations
deserve to get the balance of what's remaining
in the world's carbon budget. For economic competitiveness, for climate adaptation, for global stability and for economic justice, rich and high-emitting countries must uphold their responsibility
to lead on decarbonization, starting in their own economies. 06:18We all have a collective responsibility
to turn the tide on climate change. If we fail, it won't be because Senegal or Kenya
or Benin or Mali decided to build a handful of natural gas power plants to provide economic opportunity
for their people. 06:34Thank you."

to recognize a disturbing truth: we have colonized the future. In wealthy countries, especially, we treat it like a distant
colonial outpost where we can freely dump ecological damage and technological risk
as if there was nobody there. 00:19The tragedy is that tomorrow's
generations aren't here to challenge this pillaging
of their inheritance. They can't leap in front
of the king's horse like a suffragette or stage a sit-in
like a civil rights activist or go on a Salt March to defy their
colonial oppressors like Mahatma Gandhi. They're granted no political
rights or representation; they have no influence in the marketplace. The great silent majority
of future generations is rendered powerless. 00:45It could be hard to grasp
the scale of this injustice, so look at it this way: There are 7.7 billion people alive today. That's just a tiny fraction
of the estimated 100 billion people who have lived and died
over the past 50,000 years. But both of these are vastly outnumbered
by the nearly seven trillion people who will be born
over the next 50,000 years, assuming current birth rates stabilize. In the next two centuries alone,
tens of billions of people will be born, amongst them, all your grandchildren, and their grandchildren and the friends and communities
on whom they'll depend. How will all these future
generations look back on us and the legacy we're leaving for them? 01:30We've clearly inherited
extraordinary legacies from our common ancestors: the gift of the agricultural revolution, medical discoveries
and the cities we still live in. But we've certainly inherited
destructive legacies too. Legacies of slavery
and colonialism and racism creating deep inequities
that must now be repaired. Legacies of economies that are structurally
addicted to fossil fuels and endless growth
that must now be transformed. So how can we become the good ancestors
that future generations deserve? 02:02Well, over the past decade, a global movement has started to emerge of people committed
to decolonizing the future and extending our time horizons
towards a longer now. This movement is still fragmented
and as yet has no name. I think of its pioneers as time rebels. They can be found at work in Japan's
visionary Future Design movement, which aims to overcome the short-term
cycles that dominate politics by drawing on the principle
of seventh generation decision making practiced by many
Native Americans communities. 02:34Future Design gathers together residents to draw up and discuss plans
for the towns and cities where they live. Half the group are told
they're residents from the present day. The other half are given
ceremonial robes to wear and told to imagine themselves
as residents from the year 2060. Well, it turns out
that the residents from 2060 systematically advocate
far more transformative city plans, from healthcare investments
to climate change action. And this innovative form
of future citizens assembly is now spreading throughout Japan from small towns like Yahaba
to major cities like Kyoto. What if Future Design was adopted
by towns and cities worldwide to revitalize democratic decision making and extend their vision
far beyond the now? 03:17Now, time rebels have also
taken to courts of law to secure the rights of future people. The organization Our Children's Trust has filed a landmark case
against the US Government on behalf of 21 young people campaigning for the legal right
to a safe climate and healthy atmosphere for both current and future generations. Their David versus Goliath struggle has already inspired
groundbreaking lawsuits worldwide from Colombia and Pakistan
to Uganda and the Netherlands. And this wave of activism
is growing alongside the movement to grant legal personhood to nature, from the Whanganui River
in Aotearoa, New Zealand to the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in India. 03:57Time rebels are taking
action at the ballot box too. In 2019, teenagers across Europe began lobbying their parents
and grandparents to give them their votes in the European
parliamentary elections of that year. The hashtag #givethekidsyourvote
went viral on social media and was spread by climate
campaigners as far as Australia. My partner and I heard about it and decided to give our votes
in the last UK general election to our 11-year-old twins. So we all sat around the kitchen table
and debated the party manifestos, and they then each told us
where to put the X on the ballot sheet. And in case you're wondering, no, they didn't simply mirror
their parents' political opinions. 04:35So the time rebellion has begun. The rebels are rising
to decolonize the future founding a global movement
for long-term thinking and intergenerational justice that may turn out to be one of the most powerful
political movements of this century. They're helping us escape
the short-term cycles that digital distraction
and consumer culture trap us in, with the lure of the Buy Now button and 24/7 news. They inspire us to extend
our time horizons from seconds and minutes
to decades and far beyond. 05:06The artist Katie Paterson's
project, Future Library, will be a century in the making. Every year, a famous writer donates a book which will remain
completely unread until 2114 when the whole collection
will be printed on paper made from a forest of trees
planted for this very purpose. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault
sets its vision even further, housing millions of seeds in an indestructible
rock bunker in the Arctic Circle that's designed to last 1,000 years. But how can we really think and plan
on the scale of millennia? 05:39Well, the answer is perhaps
the ultimate secret to being a time rebel, and it comes from the biomimicry
designer Janine Benyus, who suggests we learn from nature's
3.8 billion years of evolution. How is it that other species
have learned to survive and thrive for 10,000 generations or more? Well, it's by taking care of the place
that would take care of their offspring, by living within the ecosystem
in which they're embedded, by knowing not to foul the nest, which is what humans have been doing
with devastating effects at an ever-increasing pace and scale
over the past century. 06:15So a profound starting point
for time rebels everywhere is to focus not simply on lengthening time but on regenerating place. We must restore and repair
and care for the planetary home that will take care of our offspring. For our children, and our children's children, and all those yet to come, we must fall in love
with rivers and mountains, with ice sheets and savannas, and reconnect with the long
and life-giving cycles of nature. 06:47Let us all become time rebels and be inspired by
the beautiful Mohawk blessing spoken when a child is born: ""Thank you, Earth. You know the way."""

Let's think of Earth
for just a moment as a greenhouse. Every second, a huge amount of energy
smashes into our greenhouse. Our atmosphere, the glass roof and walls, reflects some of that energy, but most of it passes right through
and heats everything up. Much of that heat
used to escape back into space, keeping us at a stable, warm temperature. 00:33But then something changed. Humans began to spew enough carbon dioxide
to fill billions of greenhouses each day. What does all that greenhouse gas do? It makes the glass
of our greenhouse thicker. Thicker glass means heat escapes
into space much more slowly. And don't forget, energy from the sun is still streaming in
just as quickly as before. 00:57The result is a planet with temperatures
too hot for our liking and, eventually... living. 01:08[Countdown Take action on climate change

Tropical North Queensland, fishing frogs from the toilet and dodging snakes
that hung from the ceiling. Wetting down old sea turtles
stranded at low tide outside our house. I spent more time outside than in, delighting in the wonders of nature. By age 11, I wasn't allowed
to watch horror films, so I turned to documentaries instead. ""The Cove,"" ""Food, Inc,""
""An Inconvenient Truth."" 00:34The first time I experienced heartbreak was when I sat glued
to my computer screen, staring at mass dolphin hunts
that turned the shoreline red. Staring as million-year-old forests
were bulldozed to produce Big Macs, staring as Al Gore projected graphs that showed how quickly
we were devouring the Earth. And how good we were
at pretending otherwise. The second time I experienced heartbreak
was in November of 2019, as I watched my country go up in flames. As one billion animals
were incinerated by the inferno. As friends tried to rescue their homes, poised on tin roofs, armed with hoses until the smoke
and embers clung to their clothes. I felt despair. Grief. Frustration. Fury. And staring at that wall of fire higher and more ferocious
than any I'd seen before, I felt helpless, small, powerless to stop the flames, powerless to protect the place I love. 02:10Australia's black summer was soon followed
by the firestorm in California as their summer rolled around, as well as flooding in Jakarta
that displaced 100,000 people. More violent hurricanes
along the east coast of America and biblical plagues of locusts
that threaten the food supply for millions of people in East Africa. 02:35Young people today
have not created this reality. We've inherited it. Yet we're told where the last generation with a chance to save
the fate of humanity. Is it any wonder that there is an epidemic
of mental health problems? Eco-anxiety is on the rise and young people seem to be
some of the worst affected. Research from 2019 showed that in the UK, 70 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds
were feeling eco-anxious, feeling helpless, grief, panic, insomnia, even guilt around climate change. Environmental disaster is the biggest
mental health issue of our lifetimes and in our war against nature
young minds are the collateral damage. 03:37At my own organization, Force of Nature, we've witnessed the same
on a global scale. We've been talking to students
in over 50 countries from Tel Aviv through Jakarta, New York to Managua. All of them have shared
this existential dread that keeps them up at night. Dread not only fueled by doom scrolling, but by the belief that adults, especially adults in power, do not care. 04:10When I first discovered documentaries, I decided the world was run by people
who were selfish and greedy, that the rest of society didn't care. That we humans were a plague
on our own planet. I've since spent the past 10 years
lobbying decision makers across business, policy and civil society, working with students in the classroom and chief executives in the boardroom, and I can tell you that my bleak outlook, while in some ways right, was in more ways very, very wrong. 04:49Picture yourself as a senior executive
at a big multinational. In the 25 years you've been climbing
that corporate ladder, you've been told your job is to make money and maintain the status quo, to deliver value to shareholders, to avoid the kind of risks
that could cost you your job. You recycle. You share climate change
articles on LinkedIn. You even went vegetarian two years ago, after watching a documentary
on mass farming. Yet when you come home
at the end of the day, you get the sense that your kids
see you as the problem. They wish you were
the climate change protester gluing themselves to the glass tower, not the person sat inside the building. 05:43When I first started working
with people in power, I was surprised to realize that they often felt
the least powerful of all, and most of these leaders
perform mental gymnastics to get away from those
uncomfortable feelings. Young people today
are falling into despair while the adults in our lives
are making sense of the situation through denial. When I ask leaders to describe
the future they envision, it's something of a techno utopia. Flying cars in a world
where deadly diseases are eradicated. Yet when I asked eight and nine-year-olds
in the classroom the same question, the future they describe
is a dystopian blockbuster. Empty supermarket shelves. Cities underwater. The kind of place no one wants
to find waiting for them when they grow up. 06:48You might find comfort in denial. Numbing yourself to our
hyper-consumptive culture, sleepwalking, even though the science tells us
that we're hurtling toward the cliff. You might feel despair,
like so many of my generation. Because while feelings
of anxiety, frustration, anger, can wake us up to the issues, they can crush us if we carry the weight
of the world on our shoulders. Neither despair nor denial help anyone. They cause us to shut down, to remove ourselves from the picture. Denial erases our responsibility. Despair lumps us with all of it. The story of denial sounds something like, ""It's not up to me,
because someone else will fix it."" The story of despair sounds like, ""It's not up to me
because it's too big to fix."" Do you hear the similarity? Despair and denial might appear
to exist on polar ends of the generational spectrum, yet they stem from the same place. How powerless we feel. All of us. I believe that the threat,
even greater than climate change, is how powerless we feel
in the face of it, concerned moms and dads, cautious corporate leaders, anxious 11-year-olds. And I don't believe
we will solve this crisis or act on the many opportunities
it presents us with until we've mobilized mindsets. 08:41So how do we shift out of despair, out of denial, towards something
radically different? There's a quote in ""Spider-Man"": ""With great power
comes great responsibility."" Yet what if the opposite is true? What if it's really ""with great
responsibility comes great power?"" This is something that all
of the world's movers and shakers have known to be true. They weren't born leaders. They simply decided to make themselves
personally responsible. Now, solving climate change
is not your responsibility because it's outside of your control. What you are responsible for is the thing inside your control, indeed, the only thing
that has ever been inside your control. Your mindset. We all have stories running on repeat, stories that immobilize us, stories the world impresses upon us
in boardrooms and classrooms alike. ""I'm just one in 7.8 billion people, I'm too small to make a difference."" ""I'm not smart enough."" ""I don't have the experience."" ""I'm not the expert."" ""The system is too broken, our leaders too shortsighted, our society too shackled
to the status quo."" These stories paralyze us. Rewriting them is the single
most powerful thing anyone of us can do for the planet and for ourselves. 10:27Now ask yourself. Which story gets in the way
of you taking action? Then think of the one thing you could do
to challenge that story. If your story is
that you're not smart enough, you could challenge it
by focusing on the skills and talents and gifts that you bring to the table. If fashion is your passion, how do we reimagine our relationship
with clothes to be fully circular? If you love making food, how do we stop a third of it
from being wasted every single day? If you're a talented musician, how do we communicate
the urgency of climate action through a universal language? If your story is
that the system is too broken, the problem is too big to fix, visualize what it would look like
for you to focus on a single problem. The climate crisis is the symptom
of many interconnected problems, from food waste to fast fashion, social inequality to how we've divorced
ourselves from nature. Every problem requires a solution. A solution delivered by a someone, like you. 11:56When you look back on your own life, what do you want to see? Will you have chosen despair, denial, or something different? Will you have been a spectator
to our planet's problems or the person who did
something to fix them? What will your story be?"
2,The ocean's ingenious climate solutions,Susan Ruffo,Feb 2022,"The ocean is often thought of as a victim of climate change, in need of human protection. But ocean expert Susan Ruffo says that mindset needs to shift. From storing carbon to providing protection to coastal communities, Ruffo highlights the ocean's ready-made solutions to the climate crisis and asks: With more than eighty percent of the ocean still unexplored, what new solutions are waiting to be discovered?", (50K),"Transcript (12 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)FootnotesFootnotes00:00So what do you think of
when you think of the ocean? Maybe you think of a visit to the beach or whales or sharks or coral reefs? I think of this. This is the San Juan Islands
in Washington state. They jut out of an expanse
of deep dark water, and they're filled with life
and mystery and opportunity. But whatever you think of,
the ocean is much more. It is a complex physical, chemical
and biological system that takes up 70 percent of our planet. And yet we're still really
just beginning to understand it. 00:33footnotefootnoteWhat we do know is that the ocean is a vital part
of our life support system on the planet. It produces at least 50 percent
of the oxygen that we breathe. So more than one in every two breaths. It also regulates temperature
for the planet. So without the ocean,
the poles would be unbearably cold and the equator would be unbearably hot, and it would be a lot harder to live here. Now we think about saving the ocean
from plastic or from oil and oil spills or from overfishing. But really, we should be thinking
about how the ocean is saving us. And what is it saving us from? It's saving us from the climate change
that we are creating. Essentially, ourselves. 01:15And so what does that mean? Basically, what we need to do is think
about not how to save the ocean, but instead how the ocean
can actually help us in this fight against climate change. Already, the ocean is absorbing
25 to 30 percent of the CO2 that we release into the atmosphere. It is the world's largest carbon sink. The ocean has also absorbed
90 percent of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. So it is basically helping
to keep the planet habitable, at least for now. And yet, when we think
about climate action and climate strategies and climate plans, we often overlook the ocean
and leave it out, because somehow we think
that saving the ocean is something else we have to do, not a core part of our climate strategy. 02:03And that's what has to change because the ocean is a core part
of our climate system, and so it has to be a core part
of our climate solutions. So what does that actually mean? Well, for starters, we know that the ocean
is already doing a lot for us. So the first thing we do need to do
to save the ocean to save ourselves is to actually reduce emissions. I don't think anyone here
would disagree with that. But that still sounds like the ocean
is a victim in the story, and really the ocean can and should
be a hero in this story. The ocean can provide us with solutions
to help us reduce those emissions, and it can also help us to adapt to this new climate reality
that we've created. So how does that happen? Well, essentially the first
thing we need to do is to make sure that we keep
all of these systems working and protect the systems
that are protecting us. Because all of that CO2 and heat
that the ocean is absorbing is actually coming at a cost. The ocean is warming
and rising and acidifying, and we even have evidence now that we're changing
the basic circulation of the ocean, which changes the way
it regulates temperature. So the first thing we need to do
is really just protect those systems that are protecting us. 03:24But how do we more actively
engage the ocean in our climate strategies? What can we do to really use the ocean
to help us reduce emissions and to adapt to the impacts
of climate change? What does that practically look like? Well, we know that coastal
ocean ecosystems like mangroves or seagrasses
or salt marshes are some of the most effective
carbon sinks on the planet. Acre for acre, they can absorb 10 times
more carbon than a forest on land. And that carbon is very deep in the soils so that it can stay there
for thousands of years if we leave it undisturbed. The problem is that we’re not
leaving it undisturbed; we are destroying these places. We’ve lost 20 to 50 percent
of them already, and we lose more every year. And all of that is creating emissions. But if we protect those places,
then those emissions stop. Just like if you shut off
a coal-fired power plant. And if we restore those places, then we can actually absorb
even more carbon. But the power of the ocean isn't limited
just to reducing emissions. The ocean can also help us to adapt
to the impacts of climate change we already feel and that we know will be here
with us for decades. Those same mangroves
can actually protect coastal communities by buffering them against
more intense coastal storms and slowing wind and waves. Another example, oysters. In New York City, they're using oysters to help reduce the risk
of major floods and flood damage like they saw during
Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The idea is that these reefs
form dense places that force water through nooks
and crannies that slow it down. So by the time it hits the shore, it actually has less power
and therefore can do less damage. And at the same time,
they're creating aquatic parks and places where people can gather
and be with nature. Because the truth is that in this new
climate reality that we've created, we will have to learn how to live
with water and with the ocean in new ways. And so what better ways to do that
than with the creatures that actually have evolved
to live in these land and sea interfaces? 05:36footnotefootnoteAnd these are real solutions
that are being implemented in real places based on what we know about the ocean now. And yet the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Association of the United States estimates that 80 percent
of the ocean is unmapped, unexplored and unobserved. So there is so much more out there
that we could be doing and thinking about as climate solutions, and so much that we're just
still getting our imaginations around. For example, what if we could actually
harness the power of the ocean's wind and waves
and tides to produce power? The International Energy Agency estimates that offshore wind alone could produce
enough energy for the Earth and 17 other planets, carbon-free. And at the same time, we could actually be providing power
to coastal communities and islands that don't benefit from our
current grids and systems. And if we're really smart about it, we can plan and design these systems
so that we're creating artificial reefs that could support wildlife
and aquaculture and help us grow food and sequester carbon and actually help the ocean
instead of harm it. Or what if we could harness more
of the ocean's biological power to help us in this fight
against climate change? For example, kelp. Kelp is one of the fastest-growing
organisms on the planet. It can grow two feet per day. What if we could actually restore
the world's kelp forests and actually grow kelp at a scale that we could use
all of that growing power to help us sequester carbon? Now, that's likely to be a lot cheaper than trying to deploy
human-made technologies out into the middle of the ocean to sequester carbon. And it's likely to be a lot less risky
than changing the ocean's chemistry or engineering the ocean, because we'd actually be working
with the natural systems instead of against them. And we'd probably have
a lot of kelp left over that we could use to feed
ourselves and feed animals and create plastic alternatives that would also help us
to lower our footprint on the planet. 07:40And this is just a sampler
of the types of solutions that the ocean has to offer
for the climate crisis. The key is that we have to think
about the ocean as a source of solutions that we can be using
and enlist it in this fight. And these aren't easy solutions. The time for that has passed. We don't have any easy solutions left. And these aren't excuses
for not doing other things, these are not silver bullets. 08:05So we still have to do the hard work of reducing and getting rid
of fossil fuels, and we still have to do
the hard work of making sure that the most vulnerable among us
will be able to adapt and thrive in the new climate reality. But the ocean is a powerful
source of solutions that we've overlooked for far too long. And so we need to think about how we really integrate it
into our strategies now. And that comes down
to a fundamental change in mindset, which is instead of thinking
about how we save the ocean, we should be thinking
about how we can help the ocean save us. 08:39Thank you. 08:40(Applause)"
2,The wonderful world of life in a drop of water,Simone Bianco and Tom Zimmerman,Mar 2018,"""Hold your breath,"" says inventor Tom Zimmerman. ""This is the world without plankton.""

on a fantastic journey to visit the creatures we call the Elders. We call them the Elders
because a half a billion years ago they tripled the amount
of oxygen in the air, which led to an explosion of life, which led to all of us. We call them the Elders,
but you probably know them as plankton. 00:23(Laughter) Now, Simone is a physicist,
and I'm an inventor. A couple of years ago, I was giving a talk
about an invention I made -- it was a 3D microscope. And Simone was in the audience. He realized that my microscope
could solve a big problem he was having. Which was, how to measure the movement
of plankton in 3D fast enough so he could mathematically model
their sensing and behavior. And I frankly needed an application
for my microscope, so ... 00:55(Laughter) 00:56It was like peanut butter meets chocolate. 00:58(Laughter) 01:00So we started working together,
studying these amazing creatures. And then we were alarmed
to discover something. And that's why we're here today. And I just want to do something with you. Now, please, just hold
your breath for a second. Yes, literally hold your breath. This is the world without plankton. You see, plankton generate
two-thirds of our oxygen using the sun. OK, now you can breathe,
because they're still here. For now. 01:31Simone Bianco: As many of you know, since 1950, the average
surface temperature of the earth has increased by one degree Centigrade due to all the carbon dioxide
we are pumping into the air. Now, while this temperature increase
may not seem like a big deal to us, it is to plankton. Indirect measurements have shown
that the global phytoplankton population may have decreased by as much
as 40 percent between 1950 and 2010 because of climate change. And you see, this is a problem also because it's starving
the fish that eat them. And about a billion people
around the world depend on fish as their primary source
of protein from animals. 02:11So you see, this isn't just
about breathing. No plankton means no fish. And that is a lot of food
we will need to replace. There's something else
that is interesting. The bodies of plankton's ancestors actually make up a for lot
of the carbon we burn today. Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me. Because the plankton that are here today
clean that carbon out of the air. But you see, they don't really
hold a grudge. 02:36(Laughter) 02:38The problem is they cannot keep up with the tremendous amount
of carbon we are dumping into the air. 02:45So what does all of this mean? Well, it means
that our big carbon footprint is crushing the very creatures
that sustain us. And yes, like Tom said, killing almost half of the creatures
that allow us to breathe is a really big deal. So you're probably asking yourself: Why aren't we doing something about it? Our theory is that plankton are tiny, and it's really, really hard to care
about something you cannot see. You see, there's a quote I really like
in ""The Little Prince"" that goes, ""What is essential
is invisible to the eye."" We really believe
that if more people could come face to ... cilia with plankton, there is a greater chance
we could all rally together and save these creatures that are so important
to life on our planet. 03:30TZ: Exactly, Simone. So to do this, we're going to bring you
scuba diving with plankton. But I just need to shrink you
by a factor of 1000, to a scale where the diameter
of a human hair is as big as my hand. And I happen to have invented
a machine to do just that. 03:51SB: Anyone here remember
""Fantastic Voyage"" or ""Innerspace?"" Yeah, yeah. Martin Short is one of my all-time
favorite actors. And now this -- this is just like that. 04:04TZ: Indeed, yes. When I was a boy,
I saw ""Fantastic Voyage,"" and I really loved how I could travel
through the bloodstream and see biology work on a cellular level. I've always been inspired
by science fiction. As an inventor, I try
and turn fantasy into reality. And I once invented this glove which let me travel and help
people like you explore the virtual world. So now I've invented this machine to let us explore the microscopic world. It's not virtual, it's real. Just really, really tiny. It's based on the microscope
that got Simone's attention. So, here's how it works. I have an image sensor like the kind in your cell phone,
behind the lens. And then I have a little tray
of plankton water like you might find from a river or my fish tank, which I never
change the water on. 04:53(Laughter) 04:55Because I love plankton. 04:56(Laughter) 04:59And underneath I have a light, an LED, which is going to cast shadows
of the plankton on the image sensor. And now this silver thing
is an XY plotter, so I can move the image sensor
to follow the plankton as they swim. Now comes the fantasy part. 05:18(Laughter) 05:20I put a tilt sensor on this helmet so I can control
the microscope with my head. And now let's look at the video
from this image sensor. These are all plankton. This is in that little tray, and with my head,
I can move the microscope. So now we're ready
to go scuba diving with plankton. My head will be the navigator, and Simone will be our tour guide. 05:49SB: Yes. 05:50(Laughter) 05:51So welcome all to the wonderful world
of life in a drop of water. Actually, as you can see, with this instrument, we are not
at all limited to a single drop. Alright, let's find something. The little creatures you see
in the center of your screen, they are called rotifer. They are the garbage collectors
of our waters. They break down organic matter and allow it to be reclaimed
by the environment. Now, you know,
nature is an amazing recycler. Structures are continuously built,
they are decomposed and recycled, and all of that is powered
by solar energy. But just think. Think about what will happen
if, you know, our garbage collectors didn't come anymore, if they disappeared. Something else?
Let's look for something else. 06:35Oh, look at that. You see the big
ice-cream-cone-shaped things? Those are called Stentor,
those are amazing creatures. You know, they are big,
but they are a single cell. You remember the rotifer we just met? That's about half a millimeter,
it's about 1,000 cells -- it's typically 15 for the brain,
15 for the stomach and you know, about the same
for reproduction, which is kind of the right mix,
if you ask me. 07:01(Laughter) 07:02But ... right? 07:04TZ: I agree. 07:05SB: But a Stentor is only a single cell. And it's able to sense
and react to its environment. You see, it will swim forward
when it's happy; it will swim backward when it's trying
to get away from something like, you know, a toxic chemical. With our friends in the Center
for Cellular Construction and the help of the National
Science Foundation, we are using Stentor to sense the presence
of contamination in food and water, which I think is really cool. Alright, last one. So the dots that you see there
that are, let's say, behind everything, they're algae. They are the creatures that provide
the majority of oxygen in the air. They convert solar light
and carbon dioxide into the oxygen that is filling
your lungs right now. So you see, we all got algae breath. 07:49TZ: (Exhales) 07:50SB: Yay! (Laughter) 07:51You know, there's something interesting. About a billion years ago, ancient plants
got their photosynthesis capability by incorporating tiny,
tiny plankton into their cells. That's exactly like us putting
solar panels on top of our roofs. So you see, the microscopic world
is even more amazing than science fiction. 08:11TZ: Oh, indeed. So now you've seen
how vital plankton are to our lives and how much we need them. If we kill the plankton, we will die of asphyxiation or starvation,
take your pick. 08:25Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes. 08:27(Laughter) 08:28In the game of plankton,
you win or you die. 08:32(Laughter) 08:35Now, what amazes me is,
we have known about global warming for over a century. Ever since the Swedish
scientist, Arrhenius, calculated the effect
of burning fossil fuel on the earth's temperature. We've known about this for a long time,
but it's not too late if we act now. Yes, yes, I know, I know,
our world is based on fossil fuels, but we can adjust our society
to run on renewable energy from the Sun to create a more sustainable
and secure future. That's good for the little creatures
here, the plankton, and that good for us -- here's why. The three greatest concerns
of people all around the globe typically are jobs, violence and health. A job means food and shelter. Look at these creatures,
they're swimming around, they're looking for a place
to eat and reproduce. If a single cell is programmed to do that, it's no surprise that 30 trillion cells
have the same agenda. Violence. Dependence on fossil fuels
makes a country vulnerable. Which leads to conflicts
all around the oil resources. Solar energy, on the other hand,
is distributed around the whole globe, and no one can blockade the sun. 09:54(Laughter) 09:55And then, finally, health. Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette. And in my opinion,
coal is like an unfiltered type. Now, just like smoking,
the best time to quit is when? 10:10Audience: Now. 10:12TZ: Now! Not when you get lung cancer. Now I know if you look around,
some people may abandon facts and reason. Only until suffering -- 10:22(Laughter) 10:23Yes, they will abandon facts and reason. But suffering will eventually
and inevitably force change. But let's instead use
our neocortex, our new brain, to save the Elders, some of the oldest
creatures on the earth. And let's apply science
to harness the energy that has fueled the Elders
for millions of years -- the sun. 10:49Thank you. 10:50(Applause)"
2,A new way to remove CO2 from the atmosphere,Jennifer Wilcox,Jul 2018,"Our planet has a carbon problem -- if we don't start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, we'll grow hotter, faster. Chemical engineer Jennifer Wilcox previews some amazing technology to scrub carbon from the air, using chemical reactions that capture and reuse CO2 in much the same way trees do ... but at a vast scale. This detailed talk reviews both the promise and the pitfalls.", (110K),"Transcript (22 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Four hundred parts per million: that's the approximate concentration
of CO2 in the air today. What does this even mean? For every 400 molecules of carbon dioxide, we have another million molecules
of oxygen and nitrogen. In this room today,
there are about 1,800 of us. Imagine just one of us
was wearing a green shirt, and you're asked to find
that single person. That's the challenge we're facing
when capturing CO2 directly out of the air. Sounds pretty easy, pulling CO2 out of the air. It's actually really difficult. 00:40But I'll tell you what is easy: avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with. But we're not doing that. So now what we have to think
about is going back; pulling CO2 back out of the air. Even though it's difficult,
it's actually possible to do this. And I'm going to share with you today
where this technology is at and where it just may be heading
in the near future. 01:08Now, the earth naturally
removes CO2 from the air by seawater, soils, plants and even rocks. And although engineers and scientists
are doing the invaluable work to accelerate these natural processes, it simply won't be enough. The good news is, we have more. Thanks to human ingenuity,
we have the technology today to remove CO2 out of the air using a chemically manufactured approach. I like to think of this
as a synthetic forest. There are two basic approaches
to growing or building such a forest. One is using CO2-grabbing chemicals
dissolved in water. Another is using solid materials
with CO2-grabbing chemicals. No matter which approach you choose,
they basically look the same. 02:01footnotefootnoteSo what I'm showing you here
is what a system might look like to do just this. This is called an air contactor. You can see it has to be
really, really wide in order to have
a high enough surface area to process all of the air required, because remember, we're trying to capture
just 400 molecules out of a million. Using the liquid-based
approach to do this, you take this high surface area
packing material, you fill the contactor
with the packing material, you use pumps to distribute liquid
across the packing material, and you can use fans,
as you can see in the front, to bubble the air through the liquid. The CO2 in the air
is separated [by] the liquid by reacting with the really strong-binding
CO2 molecules in solution. And in order to capture a lot of CO2, you have to make this contactor deeper. But there's an optimization, because the deeper
you make that contactor, the more energy you're spending
on bubbling all that air through. So air contactors for direct air capture
have this unique characteristic design, where they have this huge surface area,
but a relatively thin thickness. 03:14And now once you've captured the CO2, you have to be able to recycle
that material that you used to capture it, over and over again. The scale of carbon capture is so enormous that the capture process
must be sustainable, and you can't use a material just once. And so recycling the material requires
an enormous amount of heat, because think about it:
CO2 is so dilute in the air, that material is binding it really strong, and so you need a lot of heat
in order to recycle the material. And to recycle the material
with that heat, what happens is that concentrated CO2
that you got from dilute CO2 in the air is now released, and you produce high-purity CO2. And that's really important, because high-purity CO2
is easier to liquify, easier to transport, whether
it's in a pipeline or a truck, or even easier to use directly, say, as a fuel or a chemical. 04:13So I want to talk a little bit more
about that energy. The heat required to regenerate
or recycle these materials absolutely dictates the energy
and the subsequent cost of doing this. So I ask a question: How much energy do you think it takes to remove a million tons
of CO2 from the air in a given year? The answer is: a power plant. It takes a power plant
to capture CO2 directly from the air. Depending on which approach you choose, the power plant could be on the order
of 300 to 500 megawatts. And you have to be careful about
what kind of power plant you choose. If you choose coal, you end up emitting more CO2
than you capture. 05:01Now let's talk about costs. An energy-intensive version
of this technology could cost you as much
as $1,000 a ton just to capture it. Let's translate that. If you were to take that very expensive
CO2 and convert it to a liquid fuel, that comes out to 50 dollars a gallon. That's way too expensive;
it's not feasible. 05:23So how could we bring these costs down? That's, in part, the work that I do. There's a company today,
a commercial-scale company, that can do this as low
as 600 dollars a ton. There are several other companies
that are developing technologies that can do this even cheaper than that. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about a few of these different companies. 05:45One is called Carbon Engineering. They're based out of Canada. They use a liquid-based
approach for separation combined with burning
super-abundant, cheap natural gas to supply the heat required. They have a clever approach that allows them to co-capture
the CO2 from the air and the CO2 that they generate
from burning the natural gas. And so by doing this, they offset excess pollution
and they reduce costs. 06:14Switzerland-based Climeworks
and US-based Global Thermostat use a different approach. They use solid materials for capture. Climeworks uses heat from the earth, or geothermal, or even excess steam
from other industrial processes to cut down on pollution and costs. Global Thermostat
takes a different approach. They focus on the heat required and the speed in which it moves
through the material so that they're able to release
and produce that CO2 at a really fast rate, which allows them to have
a more compact design and overall cheaper costs. 06:54And there's more still. A synthetic forest has a significant
advantage over a real forest: size. This next image that I'm showing you
is a map of the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon is capable of capturing
1.6 billion tons of CO2 each year. This is the equivalent
of roughly 25 percent of our annual emissions in the US. The land area required
for a synthetic forest or a manufactured direct air capture plant to capture the same is 500 times smaller. In addition, for a synthetic forest, you don't have to build it on arable land, so there's no competition
with farmland or food, and there's also no reason
to have to cut down any real trees to do this. 07:46I want to step back, and I want to bring up the concept
of negative emissions again. Negative emissions require
that the CO2 separated be permanently removed
from the atmosphere forever, which means putting it back underground, where it came from in the first place. But let's face it, nobody
gets paid to do that today -- at least not enough. So the companies that are developing
these technologies are actually interested in taking the CO2 and making something useful
out of it, a marketable product. It could be liquid fuels, plastics or even synthetic gravel. And don't get me wrong --
these carbon markets are great. But I also don't want you
to be disillusioned. These are not large enough
to solve our climate crisis, and so what we need to do
is we need to actually think about what it could take. 08:42One thing I'll absolutely say
is positive about the carbon markets is that they allow for new
capture plants to be built, and with every capture plant built, we learn more. And when we learn more, we have an opportunity
to bring costs down. But we also need to be willing to invest as a global society. We could have all of the clever thinking
and technology in the world, but it's not going to be enough in order for this technology
to have a significant impact on climate. We really need regulation, we need subsidies, taxes on carbon. There are a few of us that would
absolutely be willing to pay more, but what will be required is for carbon-neutral,
carbon-negative paths to be affordable for
the majority of society in order to impact climate. 09:37In addition to those kinds of investments, we also need investments
in research and development. So what might that look like? In 1966, the US invested about
a half a percent of gross domestic product in the Apollo program. It got people safely to the moon and back to the earth. Half a percent of GDP today
is about 100 billion dollars. So knowing that direct air capture is one front in our fight
against climate change, imagine that we could invest
20 percent, 20 billion dollars. Further, let's imagine
that we could get the costs down to a 100 dollars a ton. That's going to be hard,
but it's part of what makes my job fun. 10:23And so what does that look like, 20 billion dollars,100 dollars a ton? That requires us to build
200 synthetic forests, each capable of capturing
a million tons of CO2 per year. That adds up to about five percent
of US annual emissions. It doesn't sound like much. Turns out, it's actually significant. If you look at the emissions
associated with long-haul trucking and commercial aircraft, they add up to about five percent. Our dependence on liquid fuels
makes these emissions really difficult to avoid. So this investment
could absolutely be significant. 11:05Now, what would it take
in terms of land area to do this, 200 plants? It turns out that they would take up
about half the land area of Vancouver. That's if they were fueled by natural gas. But remember the downside
of natural gas -- it also emits CO2. So if you use natural gas
to do direct air capture, you only end up capturing
about a third of what's intended, unless you have that
clever approach of co-capture that Carbon Engineering does. And so if we had an alternative approach and used wind or solar to do this, the land area would be
about 15 times larger, looking at the state of New Jersey now. One of the things that I think about
in my work and my research is optimizing and figuring out
where we should put these plants and think about
the local resources available -- whether it's land, water,
cheap and clean electricity -- because, for instance,
you can use clean electricity to split water to produce hydrogen, which is an excellent, carbon-free
replacement for natural gas, to supply the heat required. 12:10But I want us to reflect a little bit
again on negative emissions. Negative emissions should not be
considered a silver bullet, but they may help us
if we continue to stall at cutting down on CO2
pollution worldwide. But that's also why we have to be careful. This approach is so alluring
that it can even be risky, as some may cling onto it as some kind
of total solution to our climate crisis. It may tempt people to continue
to burn fossil fuels 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I argue that we should not
see negative emissions as a replacement for stopping pollution, but rather, as an addition to an existing
portfolio that includes everything, from increased energy efficiency to low-energy carbon to improved farming -- will all collectively get us on a path
to net-zero emissions one day. 13:05A little bit of self-reflection: my husband is an emergency physician. And I find myself amazed
by the lifesaving work that he and his colleagues
do each and every day. Yet when I talk to them
about my work on carbon capture, I find that they're equally amazed, and that's because combatting
climate change by capturing carbon isn't just about saving a polar bear or a glacier. It's about saving human lives. 13:37A synthetic forest may not ever be
as pretty as a real one, but it could just enable us
to preserve not only the Amazon, but all of the people that we love and cherish, as well as all of our future generations and modern civilization. 13:56Thank you. 13:58(Applause)"

A couple years ago, my friend
sent me this photo from Ürümqi, which is the capital of Xinjiang
province in northwest China. On this particular day,
she couldn't believe her eyes. Checking the quality of the air outside
using this app on her iPad, the numbers were telling her
the air quality was good, one on a scale of 500. But when she looked outside,
she saw something much different. Yes, those are buildings
in the background. 00:32(Laughter) 00:35But the data were simply
not telling the truth of what people were seeing and breathing, and it's because they were
failing to measure PM2.5, or fine particulate pollution. When PM2.5 levels
went off the charts in 2012, or ""crazy bad,"" as the US Embassy
once described it in a tweet, Chinese denizens took to social media and they started to question why it was
that they were seeing this disconnect between official air quality statistics and what they were seeing
and breathing for themselves. 01:06Now, this questioning has led to an environmental awakening
of sorts in China, forcing China's government
to tackle its pollution problems. Now China has the opportunity
to become a global environmental leader. But the picture
that I'll paint for you today is one that's mixed. There are some signs
that are very promising, and there are other trends
that are more troubling that warrant closer attention. But now let's go back
to the story at hand. 01:36I started to witness the beginnings
of China's green evolution when I was a PhD student
conducting fieldwork in China in 2011. I traveled all across the country
seeking answers to the question that I often got myself
from the skeptical outsider: What, you mean China is doing
something on the environment? They have environmental policies? What policies? At that time, PM2.5 data
was considered too politically sensitive and so the government
was keeping it secret, but citizens were becoming aware
of its harmful human health effects, and they were demanding
greater transparency on the part of the government. I actually started to see some of this
growing evolution and awareness myself cropping up all over China. Department stores, for example,
started to market these air purifiers that could filter out harmful PM2.5. Citizens were also adopting PM2.5
as the title of musical festivals. 02:32(Laughter) 02:34And then I went to a golf course
in Shenzhen, which is in southern China, and you can see from this banner,
they're advertising a retreat from PM2.5. Golf sub-par, but don't
breathe sub-par air. And then Shanghai's
Environmental Protection Bureau decided to create a mascot
named after the air quality index to better communicate
the air quality data to its people. I call her AQI Girl, and her expression and hair color changes
depending on the quality of air outside. Five years later and she's still
the mostly smiling face of Shanghai's air quality. 03:11And then in 2015, former CCTV reporter Chai Jing created this documentary
called ""Under the Dome."" It would be likened
to Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring."" And much like Rachel Carson brought to attention the fact
that pesticides were harming human health, ""Under the Dome"" stamped
into the popular consciousness that air pollution was leading
to one million premature deaths every year in China alone. This video garnered more than a hundred million
views in a single weekend before China's government, fearing that it might incite
some type of social unrest, pulled it from the internet. But the damage had already been done. 03:53footnotefootnotePublic outcry over air pollution galvanized China's government, perhaps in an act of self-preservation, to think big and decisively
about how it could tackle the root of its air pollution and many of its other
environmental problems: its energy system. For you see, in China, about two thirds of its
electricity comes from coal. China has more coal-fired power plants
than any other country in the world, about 40 percent of the global total, and it's because of this fact
that China's government has decided since 2014
to wage a war on coal, shutting down small coal mines, setting limits on coal consumption, even canceling an Australia's worth
of coal-fired power plants. They've also been making
enormous investments when it comes to clean
and renewable energy, like hydropower, wind and solar, and the pace and the scale
of this transformation has been absolutely mind-blowing. Let me give you a couple of statistics
to show you what I mean. China leads the world
when it comes to hydropower, with a third of total capacity. There's enough for every Chinese citizen to power two homes in a single year
from hydropower alone. You may have heard
of the Three Gorges Dam, pictured here, which is the largest
power station in the world, and it's powered by water. In terms of wind power, China has a third of the global capacity. This makes it the number one
leader by far. When we look at solar,
China's also leading. In fact, they crushed their 2020 target of installing 105 gigawatts
of solar power. This is after the government
already revised upwards several times its solar energy target between 2009 and 2015. Last year, in seven months alone, China was able to install
a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power. This is more than half
of what the US has combined in total and China did this
in just seven months alone. We can verify this remarkable growth
in solar power from space, like the startup SpaceKnow
has done in this slide. By 2020, China is on track to generate
Germany's entire electricity consumption from just wind and solar power alone. It's pretty darn remarkable. 06:16footnotefootnoteAnd we see some evidence now that China's efforts on clean energy is actually having an effect, not just on air pollution reduction, but also on global climate change, where China has the world's
largest carbon footprint. If we look at some of the data,
we can see that China's coal consumption may have already reached a peak
as early as 2013. This is a major reason
why China's government announced that actually they've already achieved
their 2020 carbon reduction pledge ahead of schedule. This reduction in coal consumption is also directly driving
improvements in air quality across the country, as I've shown here in blue. In most major Chinese cities, air pollution has fallen
by as much as 30 percent. And this reduction in air pollution
is actually leading people to live longer lives in China, on average two and a half years more
than they would have in 2013. In yellow, we can see
the cities that have experienced the greatest improvements in air quality. 07:19But of course, as I mentioned
at the beginning of this talk, we have to temper some of this optimism with a healthy dose of caution, and that's largely because
the data are still being determined. At the end of last year, after roughly three years
of pretty steady global carbon emissions, scientific projections suggest that global emissions
may be on the rise again and that could be due to increases
in China's fossil fuel consumptions, so they may not have reached
that peak that I showed earlier. But of course, the statistics
and the data are still murky and that's because China regularly revises
its coal statistics after the fact. Actually, it's funny, since I've been here I've been
having a debate on Twitter with other climate modelers, trying to figure out
whether China's carbon emissions have gone up, gone down or whether
they're staying relatively stable. And of course, China is still
a rapidly developing country. It's still experimenting
with a range of policies, like dockless bike sharing, which has been hailed as a possible
sustainable transport solution. But then we have images
of this bicycle graveyard that tell a more cautionary tale. Sometimes, solutions can move too fast and outpace demand. And of course,
coal is still king in China, at least for now. 08:41footnotefootnoteSo why should we care about
what China is doing on the environment? Well, what China does at home
on the environment can have global implications
for the rest of us. To borrow a line from Chai Jing, we're all under the same dome, and air pollution that originates in China can travel beyond its borders and affect populations
as far away as those in North America. China's not only exporting air pollution, but they're also exporting aid,
infrastructure, technology abroad. President Xi Jinping in 2013 announced
the One Belt, One Road Initiative, a massive, one-trillion-US-dollar
infrastructure investment project in more than 60 other countries. And historically, when we've seen that China has made
these infrastructure investments abroad, they haven't always been clean. The Global Environment Institute,
a Chinese civil society group, found that in the last 15 years, China has invested in more
than 240 coal-fired power plants in more than 68 countries affiliated with the One Belt,
One Road Initiative. That's more than a quarter of China's
own domestic coal-fired capacity that is exported abroad. 09:52So we can see that even though
China is cleaning up at home, it's exporting some of that pollution to other countries, and greenhouse gas emissions
simply don't have a passport. So when we're trying
to evaluate this question of whether or not China
is actually leading, we can see it's still
very much an open debate. 10:12But time is running out. I've studied the climate models,
and the outlook is not good. We still have a gap
between current policies and what needs to happen if we want
to avoid dangerous climate change. Leadership is what we desperately need, but it's not coming
from the US, for example. The US administration last June
announced its intent to withdraw from
the Paris Climate Agreement, so now people are looking towards China
to fill that leadership void. 10:40So China is very much in the driver's seat determining our global
environmental future. What they do on carbon trading, on clean energy, on air pollution, we can learn many lessons. One of those lessons is that clean energy
is not just good for the environment, it can save lives
by reducing air pollution. It's also good for the economy. We can see that last year, China was responsible
for 30 percent of the global growth in green jobs. The US? Only six. 11:12So the picture that I just painted for you hopefully seems much different from those murky,
foggy air quality statistics to a much clearer picture
of China's clean energy. And even though China
is headed in the right direction, we know that there's still
a very long road ahead. 11:30So let me ask you once more:
Is seeing believing? Can we trust the data and the statistics that show that China's
air quality is coming down and that its war on coal
is actually having an effect? Well, let's take a look
at some of the latest satellite images of China's solar power installations. I want you to look
very closely at this image. Can you see? The proof may just be in the pandas. 11:59Thank you so much. 12:00(Applause)"
2,Global priorities bigger than climate change,Bjorn Lomborg,Jan 2007,"Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming?

I'm not going to talk about ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"" -- probably that's also a good choice. (Laughter) 00:09But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world? And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. So get out your pen and paper. Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world. I'm just going to list some of them. There are 800 million people starving. There's a billion people without clean drinking water. Two billion people without sanitation. There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. The lists go on and on. There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on. There are many, many problems out there. 00:44In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. We don't actually solve all problems. And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves -- and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say, if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first? And that's the question I'd like to ask you. If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world, where should we spend it? We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers. We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things? Where should we start on solving these problems? But that's a wrong problem to ask. That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January. 01:43But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. Because we can't solve problems. Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die. But we don't have a technology to solve that, right? So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems. And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated. To climate change that would be like Kyoto. To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on. The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do, first. What should be at the bottom of the list? Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues. 02:41The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean, I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right? I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize? Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before? And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. Nobody wants to do this. Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list. We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first? So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing -- any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it. 03:50So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes. We have not had an idea. Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is. You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is. It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars. It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right? We'd like to know these things. 04:18And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues. And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process. We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area. So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. What can we do? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that? Likewise in communicable diseases. Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do? What would be the price? What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome? And so on. 04:47Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004. We called them the ""dream team."" The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here. And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. And then you ask, why economists? And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) -- because that's a very good question. The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert. If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist. But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do. That is what economists do. They prioritize. They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards? 05:38So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on. They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back. Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects. And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing. I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects. 06:04These were the bad projects. As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change. This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either. And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious. Why is it it came up? And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. 06:26The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient. It's not saying that global warming is not happening. It's not saying that it's not a big problem. But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost. What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. That's a substantial amount of money. That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. Yet it would do very little good. All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100. So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106. Which is a little good, but not very much good. So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. 07:14And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good? Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good? And that is really why it becomes a bad project. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority. 07:47The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing. It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly. Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure. So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world. 08:21The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria. The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year. It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half. We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year. We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming. 08:57This third best one was free trade. Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years. That would be the third best thing we could do. 09:27The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients. Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem. That would be the second best investment that we could do. 09:50And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS. Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS. Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. One is treatment; the other one is prevention. And again, in an ideal world, we would do both. But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention. So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate. 10:44What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities. I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right? Or did you get close to what we came up with here? Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again. I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that. 11:03We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem. But of course, we don't do all problems. There are many problems out there in the world. And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems, that we focus on the right ones. The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good. And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer. Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today. Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are. And of course, we'll be even richer than that. 11:52But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. And so the real point, of course, is to say, do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy? Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh, who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply? Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, ""How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, and who needed the help so much more?"" 12:49So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight. Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. We have, you know, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" -- it looks great, right? It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter) It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems. To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good. 13:37The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice. Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree. I think we should do all things, but we don't. In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world. Since then our aid has halved. So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems. 14:07Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war? You know, we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world? I'm all for that. If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine. But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we? So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities. I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out? You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men. And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world. 14:44So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English. The majority of them were, first, from developing countries. They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists. And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. We've done this many other times. There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things. They all come out with very much the same list. And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world? Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything. But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start? 15:36I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012. Map out the right path for the world -- but also to start thinking about political triage. To start thinking about saying, ""Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now."" 16:04At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do. If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things. So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world. Thank you."

about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog. They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science. 00:16Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system. That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus
scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest
scientific meeting in the world. 00:42Over 15,000 scientists go
to San Francisco every year for that. Every one of those scientists
is in a research group, and every research group studies
a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge, it's as varied
as the El Niño Oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce
biofuels, which is what I study. 01:00And in each one of these research areas,
of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me,
and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes
or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study
is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip
is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --
molecules of isoprene. 01:22But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted
into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight
of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff.
It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff, it's really important
for the atmospheric system. 01:36Because it's important
to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions,
or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer
than what happens in your car. But still, we look at the pieces. 01:51We run enormous models on supercomputers;
this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds
of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables
each, on minute timescales. It takes weeks to perform
our integrations, and we perform dozens of integrations
in order to understand what's happening. 02:06We also fly all over the world
looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign
in Malaysia -- there are others. We found a global atmospheric
watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene and other things
while we were there. This is the tower in the middle
of the rainforest from above, and the tower from below. 02:27On part of that field campaign
we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane, the model BAe-146,
which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people, so maybe you took a similar aircraft
to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters
above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule --
incredibly dangerous stuff. 02:44We have to fly at a special incline
to make the measurements; we hire military and test pilots
to do the maneuvering; we need special flight clearance. As you come around the banks
in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs; the scientists must be
completely harnessed in in order to make measurements
while on board. So as you can imagine, the inside of the aircraft doesn't look
like one you'd take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory we took
to make measurements of this molecule. 03:08We do all this to understand
the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me
has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper
on the subject. And out of that field campaign
we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. 03:23As a body of knowledge builds up,
it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection, of an assessment like the IPCC,
although we have others. And each one of the 11 chapters
of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine
the scale of the effort. In each one of the assessments we write,
we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written
for a non-scientific audience. And we hand that summary
to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these. 03:49Thank you very much. 03:50(Applause)"
2,Life in Biosphere 2,Jane Poynter,Jun 2009,Jane Poynter tells her story of living two years and 20 minutes in Biosphere 2 -- an experience that provoked her to explore how we might sustain life in the harshest of environments., (38K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolEsperantoFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1. I've also lived in Biosphere 2. And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn something. 00:21So what did I learn? Well, here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza. So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough. And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza. Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, ""Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"" 00:43So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes. (Laughter) Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass, underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miniature rainforest, a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert. We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything. And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived. 01:16Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2, we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean, what is a biosphere? Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right? Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. 01:44This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen, walked in, to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive, the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin, or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus. But of course none of that happened. 02:08And over the ensuing few years, there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2. But by 1991 we finally had this thing built. And it was time for us to go in and give it a go. We needed to know, is life this malleable? Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive? Big questions. And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it? We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. Let's take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres? 03:03So eight of us went in: four men and four women. More on that later. (Laughter) And this is the world that we lived in. So, on the top, we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean, and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that. One of the Biospherians called it ""garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier."" And then also we had the human habitat of course, with the laboratories, and all of that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm. 03:39The day I walked into Biosphere 2, I was, for the first time, breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world, except seven other people. At that moment I became part of that biosphere. And I don't mean that in an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. (Laughter) And those sweet potatoes became part of me. In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. 04:27When it came to our atmosphere, however, it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term, because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen. And we knew that we were losing CO2. And so we were working to sequester carbon. Good lord -- we know that term now. We were growing plants like crazy. We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement, growing plants, going around, around, around, trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could. We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air. But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected, because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module. And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. 05:16And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness, do you feel dreadful. I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you'd wake up gasping with breath, because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) -- take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating. And everybody outside thought we were dying. I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying. And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, ""No, Mum, it's fine, fine. We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."" And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine. But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And you might think, well, ""Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"" Yes. In a sense it was terrifying. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was going to say, ""I can't take it anymore!""? Not me, that was for sure. 06:25But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool, and see if we could, in fact, find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. And we did indeed find it. And we found it in the concrete. Essentially it had done something very simple. We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air; it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. 06:54So at the end of the two years when we came out, we were elated, because, in fact, although you might say we had discovered something that was quite ""uhh,"" when your oxygen is going down, stopped working, essentially, in your life support system, that's a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept, more or less. People, on the other hand, was a different subject. We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts, I will say. 07:28And the day I came out of Biosphere 2, I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. They stank! People stink! We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant, and all kinds of stuff. Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean, but nothing with perfume. And boy do we stink out here. Not only that, but I lost touch of where my food came from. I had been growing all my own food. I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from. I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops, reading all the names on all of the things. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishing. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. 08:44So I went about my business: Paragon Space Development Corporation, a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere, because I had nothing else to do. And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them? And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. 09:17And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon, which is going to be pretty fun. And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system. 09:45As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places, in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa. Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia, is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful, incredibly stark, and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand, and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation. And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals, so that they could produce milk and whatnot, like we had in the Biosphere. 10:42And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next-door neighbors. So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally. And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these, and turning them into all of this food. They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense. 11:15I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp, I was thinking to myself, ""How do you put a box around this?"" When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally, I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. And put your project in that context. 11:47Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species, one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time. This is in fact, this beautiful photograph, is in fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are, in fact, fires, human-made fires. We're in the process of transforming from this, to what I would call a biophilic society, one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it, but we are. It is happening all across the world, in every kind of walk of life, and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. And I think often times people get lost in that. They go, ""But how can I possibly find my way in that? It's such a huge subject."" And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. 12:56This is the story of a rake in my backyard. This was my backyard, very early on, when I bought my property. And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out, and I want to throttle them. It's a certain type of aesthetic. We're very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I threw away my rake. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time, essentially what have I been doing? I've been building topsoil. And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every spring. For six weeks, six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis. This is actually in a riparian area. And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. The small stuff counts. 13:59The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus -- has given us this, the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this, the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to, and compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world, and try to understand where we are in its context, and how we choose to interact with it. 14:31And if you lose where you are in your biosphere, or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere, I would say to you, take a deep breath. The yogis had it right. Breath does, in fact, connect us all in a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe, think about what is in your breath. There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you. Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us in time. There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs. There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren. Thank you.

we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle,
present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans,
in the atmosphere and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon
makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow
and reabsorb the carbon. 00:23But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees
and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon
trapped in rock. And human activities,
like burning fossil fuels, also release some
of that prehistoric carbon. 00:45Today, humans release
around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes
on the planet each year. That overloads Earth's carbon cycle and builds up in the atmosphere and oceans. 00:57Planting more trees will help,
but trees alone can't get us to net zero. There's only one sure way
to stop global warming. We must stop releasing
this excess carbon into our air. 01:15[Countdown Take action on climate change

2,The hidden wonders of soil,Jane Zelikova,Jun 2022,"From nourishing our foods to storing massive amounts of carbon, soil is teeming with diverse microbial life that could slow global warming. Climate change scientist Jane Zelikova calls for agricultural practices that protect Earth's soil by growing climate-adapted crops that don't mess with the microbes. ""Soils are the literal foundation of life on this planet -- the reason that we eat and the climate solution just waiting to be unlocked,"" she says.", (39K),"Transcript (10 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00Under our feet, there is an unseen world more diverse than all
the tropical rainforests combined. Teeming with microbial life
and critters, large and small, this hidden world of soil
is on every single continent. But most of us know little to nothing
about this vast world under our feet. And for most of my life, I was no exception. 00:26I grew up [a] very curious
and adventurous kid. I spent a lot of time climbing trees
and falling out of them. And I spent a lot of time
getting really dirty. In college, I had to take a class
for a science requirement, and I was shocked to discover
that being really curious and loving dirt could be
a legitimate career. So it took no convincing whatsoever
for me to change my major, and that's how I became an ecologist. 01:00In graduate school, I studied
how the loss of a seed disperser, in this case, the winnow ant, affected the plants that they disperse. In my research site, we were discovering that these ants
were moving up in elevation to escape a rapidly changing climate. But they were leaving the plants
they dispersed behind. So while I came
to grad school to study ants, I all of a sudden found myself
studying climate change. And because ants nest in soils,
I had to learn a lot more about soil. 01:32What I couldn't have predicted,
as that young, curious, budding ecologist, was that I would spend
the next decade of my life thinking about the invisible
army of soil microbes and how we can harness
their awesome powers to help address climate change. 01:47But before we get to all of that,
let's start at the beginning. Soils are considered to be
the skin of the Earth. They're only a few meters thick, but they support all agriculture
and every single terrestrial biome. Soils help protect our food supply, clean our water, boost our immune systems, and they serve as a source
for some critical medicines, including many that have
yet to be discovered. Without Earth's exceedingly
thin layer of soil and its multitude of organisms, we would not eat, and humanity as we know it may not exist. 02:28And soils, like many good things,
they take time to develop. They form over hundreds
to thousands of years as rocks break down and plants and animals decompose. As soils form, they accumulate
and store carbon. In fact, there are billions of tons
of carbon stored underground. Two to three times more
than what we have in the atmosphere. Plants and soil work in collaboration to drive the single most important
transformation of carbon on this planet, photosynthesis. Plants take carbon dioxide from the air, and they combine it with water
and sunshine to create sugars. And of course, to grow plants. Plants and their sugars eventually
decompose in the soil, feeding the microbes. In fact, most of the carbon
that comes in through plants ends up in soil at some point. The carbon cycle continues. Microbes and their carbon
eventually break down, and the carbon from the microbes
sticks to soil particles, creating what we call
soil clumps or aggregates. Because microbial carbon is sticky. So when that microbial carbon
ends up in a clump, it's physically protected
from further decomposition. And what we know now is that the majority of soil carbon
that is sequestered is actually dead microbes or what we call microbial necromass. That necromass can stick around in soils
for decades to millennia, especially if we leave soils undisturbed. 04:03But over the last 12,000 years, we have lost billions of tons
of carbon from our soil as humans converted
grasslands and forests into agricultural fields and range lands, building roads and cities. One of the major drivers
of that loss was the plow, which, at the time, was a major
technological breakthrough that really revolutionized agriculture and altered the trajectory
of human history. With each pass of the plow, those plant roots and soil aggregates
that we know are really important are broken apart,
exposing carbon to decomposition. Today we use more than a third of our land to feed and clothe
billions of people on this planet. But we're losing our soils
at an alarming rate, and with it, we're losing their fertility. Without that soil, it's going to be a lot harder to feed what is going to be
close to 10 billion people on this planet by 2050. That's going to put a lot more pressure on what is already a disappearing and resoundingly
underappreciated resource. 05:13There is no machine
that can bring soil back. No technology that can do what thousands
of years of rock weathering and biological activity have achieved. But we can build our soils
and put more carbon underground with a little help
from plants and microbes. Rebuilding soil is going to require us
to fundamentally rethink our reliance on technology and chemicals to deliver what soils can do on their own: support life. 05:44And life in soil is mostly microbial. The Dutch scientist,
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, saw tiny organisms
he called the ""wee beasties,"" under his microscope about 350 years ago. And with the rapid innovation of molecular
and computational tools, we are finally getting
a sneak peek at who they are and how they make their way in the world. 06:07Here's the thing. A teaspoon of soil
holds billions of organisms, things like bacteria, fungi,
protists and archaea. These microbes
are the movers and shakers of nature's carbon cycle. They drive really important
processes in soil, they take organic matter and convert it into complex
carbon molecules. And having more carbon in soil
is transformative. As carbon accumulates, agricultural fields can hold on
to more water and more nutrients, building resilience that helps them deal with the ups and downs
of a changing climate. That resilience means
plants can grow more consistently, even when the weather is fickle. And the awesome thing is
carbon-rich soils help buffer us against what is an uncertain
climate future. The trick is to really rethink
how we do agriculture. 07:01So there is the good news, 07:04which is there are some
tried and true ways 07:06that we can get more carbon
in our soils and build our soils back. We can plow less, and we can make sure that we have
roots in the ground year round, feeding the microbes and powering that microbial engine
humming under our feet. And we can do this. 07:24The other thing is, diversity is the key
ingredient in this recipe. Diverse plant communities
support diverse microbial communities that can transform and store more carbon. Diversity is good for soils, and it's good for climate mitigation. Just like we need every microbe, we need every farmer and rancher, every climate solution and every solver. 07:51So ... Healthy, carbon-rich soils
matter today more than ever. The other great thing
about carbon-rich soils is they help farmers have
more consistent agricultural operations and more sustainable ones that can withstand the ups and downs
of a changing climate. That's a huge win
for the people that grow our food, it’s a win for climate,
and it’s a win for us consumers. So how do we do it? 08:21Well, there are three simple
things we can do. Number one, we have to protect our soils
and the carbon they already hold. Number two, we can get
more carbon underground by growing diverse, climate-adapted crops. And number three, we can let
the microbes do their thing. Leave them alone
by leaving the soil undisturbed. It sounds simple,
and that's because it kind of is. But there are some questions
that are left to be answered, and there's a lot of room
for us to innovate. We need to track and measure
our climate progress. We need to develop more
climate-resilient crop varieties that can grow deeper roots and pump carbon underground deeper. And we need to rethink
our economic models and agriculture and help support and incentivize these carbon-sequestering
agricultural practices. So lots of room for innovation,
lots of room for research. Good news for us scientists. 09:26But we don't have time to waste. Climate change is here and it's affecting
all of us, whether we know it or not. It's affecting every single ecosystem,
including agriculture. Soils are the literal foundation
of life on this planet, the reason that we can eat and the climate solution
just waiting to be unlocked. So let's build back our soils, help our planet by looking
down to the ground. 09:53Thank you. 09:55(Applause)"
2,Africa's great carbon valley — and how to end energy poverty,James Irungu Mwangi,Jun 2022,"Our lives depend on curbing climate change, but so many priorities seem to be in competition. What's the most urgent thing humanity can do right now? Social entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi tells us why Africa could be the ideal home for scaling the latest and most ambitious climate technologies -- including in places like Kenya's Hell's Gate National Park, which could become part of what he calls the ""Great Carbon Valley.""", (43K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de Portugalالعربيةहिन्दी00:01Welcome to the gates of hell. Now depending on your frame of mind, that is either a bizarrely morbid
or entirely appropriate way to start a talk about climate
action in the year 2022. Behind me is a picture
from the Hell's Gate National Park in the town of Naivasha,
in the Great Rift Valley in my home country, Kenya. Now its name may not
scream “tourist trap,” but believe me, it is a beautiful part of the world
and you should all try and visit sometime. But more importantly, it could play -- It has the potential
to play a crucial role in the fight against global
climate catastrophe. 00:48The most recent IPCC reports are clear. Humanity has left
cutting emissions too late. Any realistic path to avoiding
unacceptable levels of warming now requires us to not only
drastically cut emissions, at least halving them by 2030, but also undertake
an equally massive effort to remove greenhouse gases
from the atmosphere at an accelerating rate. 01:17Now, let's be clear. Greenhouse gas removal is not and cannot
be an excuse for continuing to emit. Just as installing seat belts
and airbags is not an excuse for deliberately ramming
your car into a wall. 01:33(Laughter) Indeed, current estimates suggest that even with drastic
emissions reductions, the world will need to be removing between five and 16 billion tons
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
every single year by 2050. 01:51Now to give you a sense
of the scale of that, the low end of that range,
five billion tons, that's bigger than the size of the global
petroleum industry in 2020. So let's not kid ourselves
that carbon removal, at anywhere close to the scale
that we will need in order to survive, is some sort of easy way out. It is going to be damn difficult to do. So how do we do it? 02:19Well, the first and most familiar measures
would be interventions such as reforestation
and landscape restoration. Essentially giving Mother Nature
the time and space to heal herself. In addition, we can increase
the amount of carbon held in our soils through the widespread
application of biochar and enhanced weathering
of chemically suitable rocks. We estimate that in Africa alone, something like 100 million to 680 million
additional tons of carbon dioxide could be drawn from the atmosphere
using these types of methods. However, they do require a lot of land, a lot of water and a lot
of other natural resources that may limit the extent
to which we can scale them. Moreover, they are subject
to some of the feedback loops from the climate change
that we are already experiencing, such as more frequent
and intense wildfires. And all of that means we are going to need
to supplement them with technologies that accelerate
and amplify natural processes to remove carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. 03:26Enter the members
of my new favorite boy band. DAC, BECCS and BiCRS. 03:34(Laughter) 03:36These are a set of engineered approaches that use physical, chemical
and biological processes to gather and concentrate
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere before safely sequestering it,
usually underground. As more people run the climate math, you're seeing growing levels of interest
and investment in these technologies, with billions of dollars already
being committed to early pilots and installations in various
parts of the world, particularly in Europe and North America. But the reality is they have
a very long way to go. To date, engineered removals
around the world have accounted for something
like 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide removed total. To get to the multi-billion-ton scale
we’re going to need by 2050 is going to take a truly epic
process of exponential scaling. Probably means we need
to get to something -- If we want to have a realistic shot at it, we need to get to something
like 100 million tons per year by 2030. For those of you running the calculators, that's a thousand-fold increase
in less than a decade. And guess what? We will have to continue
that insane rate of growth for another two decades after that. 04:57And here's the really bad news. Anything close to that level
of scaling of this industry in the places where
it’s currently being piloted presents some really difficult
climate action trade offs. For that, let me take the example
of DAC or direct air capture. The best known DAC facility
in the world is in Iceland. It's the Orca plant in Iceland,
it was inaugurated last year, 2021. It uses plentiful green geothermal energy to capture carbon dioxide,
dissolve it in water and inject it into porous basalt
deep underground, where it chemically reacts
to create a stable solid that can stay there for centuries. It takes the equivalent of between two
and three megawatt hours of energy to take a single ton
of carbon dioxide today and render it in that way. To get to the hundred
million number in 2030, on that track, would entail something like 200
to 300 terawatt hours of electricity. Again, that's about half
the electricity usage of Germany. And all of that power
would need to be renewable, otherwise, we would be taking
two steps forward and one and a half steps back. 06:18Now it's reasonable to expect and assume that we are going to see substantial
improvements in energy efficiency of these technologies as we deploy them
and learn to use them better. However, keep in mind that probably the most urgent thing we can do
to slow climate change right now is stop current emissions. And so scaling these technologies in places where we do have
fossil fuel energy emissions that we could be curtailing does not make sense. Essentially, every unit
of renewable energy that we are bringing on stream
in places like North America and Europe should be going towards displacing and retiring existing
fossil fuel capacity. And so the world is kind of stuck. Right? We need to scale this technology. We need to get DAC down the cost curve
and up the efficiency curve urgently. Our lives literally depend on it. But at the same time, we cannot do it except at the expense of other
equally urgent climate imperatives. 07:24So we need places in the world
that somehow have three characteristics. A, they need to have the right
geophysical conditions. You know, plenty of porous basalt rock
in a geothermally active zone is one such example. Two, they need to have plenty
of renewable energy potential. And three, they need to have no current
proximate emissions that that renewable energy
could be used to displace. 07:52And that brings us back
to Hell's Gate National Park. Here's another view of the park from an angle that may
explain its potential. That is one of the power plants
that together constitute the Olkaria Geothermal Energy Plant, which provides about a third
of Kenya's electricity. That's right. My home country not only has
92 percent renewable electricity being dispatched on its grids today, but its largest single-energy installation is seamlessly integrated into
an honest-to-goodness national park. Literally, between the different plants
you can see herds of zebra peacefully grazing all times of the day. It's amazing. 08:37Now at just under 1,000 megawatts, Olkaria is nothing to sneeze at. It's one of the largest geothermal
electricity installations in the world. But it's barely scratching the surface
of the potential in Kenya. There's 10 gigawatts of proven, high-quality geothermal
resource in the country, widely recognized, ready to be tapped. And in addition, Kenya is endowed with excellent
wind and solar resources that have also barely been exploited. We are on the equator, after all. We estimate conservatively
that there's about 50 gigawatts of potential deployable
renewable energy in Kenya that can be readily accessed
with the right level of investment. And yet, Kenya remains
an energy-poor country where, despite a lot of progress
in recent years, more than a quarter of the population
still does not have access to basic electricity. And those that do often pay prices
that are almost three times as much as much as their counterparts
in countries like India and China. 09:46Now you might be sitting there wondering, ""Well, all right, James, if this is true, if Kenya has all of this
renewable energy potential and all of these people in need of energy, well, before we have this whole
conversation about fancy climate tech, shouldn’t we first have a TED Talk
about affordable energy access?” And you would be right. Were it not for a particularly cruel
paradox of energy economics in countries like Kenya. You see, part of the reason
why energy is so expensive in the country is those consumers who are on the grid have to pay for capacity
that is not currently being used. There's something like 1,000 megawatt
hours every day that goes begging because there isn’t sufficient
industrial demand. At the same time, those very same high energy prices make the country unattractive
and uncompetitive for manufacturers and other users of energy looking for places
to site their industries. 10:45So to get this straight, the reason why the average Kenyan
cannot get affordable access to clean, renewable energy
despite all of this natural bounty, is this tremendously frustrating
feedback loop where firstly, we would have all of that energy if someone invested
in renewable power plants. People would invest in those power plants if there was a lot of available
industry to use the energy. Available industry would come
if energy costs weren’t so high. And energy costs wouldn’t be so high
if there was enough demand. It's enough to drive you crazy. But it also points the way
to a potential huge triple opportunity. 11:33Firstly, introducing DAC and other
energy-hungry climate technology into places like the Rift Valley would give them the space
and capacity they need to really scale to planetary levels. With no competition, with none of the trade-offs they would
face in other parts of the world. At the same time, having that energy-hungry
anchor industry available suddenly creates the basis
on which people are willing to invest in expanding the country's
renewable energy potential. Actually creating the business case for providing tens of millions of people with the productive energy they need
to improve the quality of their lives. And thirdly, introducing these new
and exciting technologies on the continent with the world's youngest
and fastest-growing workforce could potentially activate
their imaginations and their energies towards
becoming climate innovators and solution builders themselves, basically building an army
from the world's largest workforce to solve the world's biggest problem. 12:36I call it the “Great Carbon Valley.” And it's just one of the ways
in which Africa, as the continent, which, per capita,
is the closest to net-zero and has contributed the least
to climate change, can play a role in helping the planet
avert climate disaster. 12:57But in addition, it can do more and be the first continent
to go substantially net-negative. We're used to thinking about the continent
in terms of its forests, its peatlands, its grasslands, its wetlands that need to be preserved. And we should definitely continue
to invest in the Indigenous communities, the smallholder farmers
and the local innovators who are protecting and expanding
natural carbon sinks. But that should not blind us to the fact that Africa also provides
an ideal potential home for scaling the latest and most ambitious
of climate technologies. 13:35Whichever of these narratives
most speaks to you, one thing should be clear. We need to shake the old, tired idea that Africa is a poor, hapless,
helpless climate change victim. Instead, Africa and its people
have the potential. They can, and they should, be
the world’s climate vanguard. 14:00Thank you. 14:01(Applause and cheers)"
2,How to find joy in climate action,Ayana Elizabeth Johnson,Jun 2022,"We can all play a role in the climate movement by tapping into our skills, resources and networks in ways that bring us satisfaction, says climate leader Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. She suggests drawing a Venn diagram to map these questions: What are you good at? What is the work that needs doing? And what brings you joy? Where your answers intersect is where you should put your climate action effort. ""Averting climate catastrophe: this is the work of our lifetimes,"" Johnson says.", (40K),"Transcript (11 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroTiếng Việtالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)한국어00:00People often ask me what they can do to help
address the climate crisis. But what they usually mean is what’s one quick, easy,
simple thing they can do. 00:13Well, that particular ship has sailed. The climate challenge is gargantuan. Thanks largely to fossil fuel executives and the PR firms and politicians
doing their bidding. We need to eliminate
greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, transportation,
agriculture, industry and buildings. We need to protect and restore ecosystems. We need to change society, policy,
economy and culture. This is about transformation, and the stakes for humanity are greater
than my heart and mind can fully fathom. 00:50So I find the best way to cope with this is to avoid dwelling on the terrifying
scientific projections and instead pivot quickly to solutions. Now, the climate movement and the media all too often ask each of us
to do the same things. To vote, protest, donate, spread the word, lower our carbon footprint. That term, by the way, carbon footprint, was popularized
by fossil fuel corporations in an attempt to put the blame
on us as individuals. But yes, it is good to do those things. I do those things. 01:28However, all too rarely are we asked
to contribute our special talents, our superpowers, to climate solutions. And what a failing. For that would actually enable
the radical changes we need. 01:42So where do we each begin? Here's my best answer. A Venn diagram. The first circle is: What are you good at,
what are your areas of expertise? What can you bring to the table? Think about your skills,
resources and networks. The second circle is: What is the work that needs doing? Are there particular climate and justice
solutions that you're keen on? Think about systems level changes, things that can replicate or scale. Things like composting initiatives,
insulating buildings, restoring wetlands, getting climate candidates elected. And electrifying everything. There are heaps of options. The third circle is: What brings you
joy or satisfaction? There is so much work to be done. Please do not choose something
that makes you miserable. This is the long haul. So it's critical to avoid burnout. Choose things that enliven you. 02:45The goal is to be at the heart
of this Venn diagram for as many minutes
of your life as you can. 02:54If you're familiar
with the Japanese concept of Ikigai for finding your purpose, you can consider this a simplified,
climate-focused version of that. Taking this approach will enable
way more progress on climate solutions than if we each obsess
about our individual footprints. 03:13For example, nine months after being inspired, when I took him to his first
climate protest, Boris Khentov, a financial tech executive, launched a climate impact investing fund. And honestly, I don't care if Boris
never goes to another protest again. Sarah Stillman, a journalist who covers
systemic injustices in immigration and worker's rights, has started including a deep and nuanced
climate context for these issues in her reporting. And my own mother,
a retired English teacher, became a small but mighty part
of getting fracking banned in New York state. And is now mothering chickens and converting her lawn into a model
for small-scale regenerative farming. 04:00I call these climate action Venn diagrams, and having now seen many of them, in doing crayon versions by children, delightfully detailed versions by adults, this is one of my favorites. I have a few additional
parameters to offer before you draw your own. 04:18This does not necessarily mean
you should quit your job, or go start a non-profit. Quite possibly, you are most powerful
in your existing roles, where you already have specialized
knowledge and robust networks. So how might you lean in to those talents? Can you help your town,
company, church or school charge ahead with climate solutions? Because what we need
is change in every sector and in every community. And be gentle with yourself
on the ""what are you good at"" question. Set your insecurities aside and simply consider
what you have to offer. Over the last year
since I've been sharing this concept, lots of people have been drawing their
own and posting them on Instagram. It's been super exciting to see
what people have been coming up with. But I’ve noticed that a lot of them
are landing on some version of: “Communicate about climate.” Now, I fully appreciate the irony, given that I am standing here
talking to you about climate, but we can't all just talk about it. We need doers, we need
mutual aid organizers and city council members. We need green building retrofitters and wind turbine installers
and bike lane planners. We need culture shapers and policy nerds. We need employees pushing
their corporate employers to change. 05:45(Applause) 05:49Here's where I will offer what I consider to be the sexiest word
in the English language: implementation. 05:59(Laughter) 06:02Because we already have
most of the solutions we need. We need to get to work
and to pick up the pace. We need to build the biggest,
strongest team possible to tackle this most enormous challenge
humanity has ever faced. 06:16Another word I love
that is perfect for this moment is leaderful. I learned this term
from Black Lives Matter activists who use it as an organizing principle. Social movements can be fragile when they're helmed
by a few prominent leaders. We need many leaders
to accelerate this transformation from a fossil fueled economy
to a regenerative one. Maybe you are one of those leaders. Or maybe you don't want to be out front. That is more than OK. This is not about being
a hero or an influencer. This is about being useful. and advancing solutions. Contribute to an existing effort,
make it possible, build the website, raise the funds, plan the events, recruit the talent. The question should not merely be, ""What can I do to help
address the climate crisis?"" But, ""What can we do together?"" Join something. And if you need a bit of inspiration, here is a list of some
climate solutions to consider. 07:19So what will you do?
Or how will you step it up? Actually draw this out. What are you good at?
What is the work that needs doing? And what brings you joy? Also try to avoid diagramming your way
to what you’re already doing. Think about this expansively. Start with a blank slate, and consider
how you can make your best impact. Remember: this is about action. 07:47I've emphasized the importance of everyone contributing
to climate solutions. 07:53So before I close, I want to mention one
of the major barriers to participation. Inequality. Perhaps you know that around the world, it's people of color
who are most heavily impacted by the effects of climate change, whether that's air pollution,
hurricanes, droughts or floods. But you may not know that it is also people of color
who are most concerned about climate and most likely to want
to be a part of the solutions. In the US, where we have
robust data on this, 49 percent of white Americans
are concerned about climate, compared to 57 percent of Black Americans and 69 percent of Latinx Americans. Imagine the huge and additional
contributions these folks could make if unburdened from the dangerous
distraction that is racism. And goodness, do we need
all of that ingenuity and leadership. In other words, help us, help you,
help us all save the planet. 08:54(Applause) 08:56My last challenge to you, then, since all our fates are intertwined, is in addition to leveraging your talents, can you help others in using theirs? And let's work to demolish
the societal barriers that prevent people
from fully devoting themselves to climate solutions. 09:17This is what I know. There are innumerable possible futures. I know we each get some say
in which future we'll collectively have, and a chance to help build it. I know that every 10th of a degree
of warming we prevent, every centimeter
of sea level rise we avoid, every bit of nature
we protect and restore matters I know that our actions add up. This? This is an invitation. Find your role if you haven’t already, encourage others to find theirs. 09:54Averting climate catastrophe: this is the work of our lifetimes. 10:01Thank you. 10:02(Applause)"
2,How to shift your mindset and choose your future,Tom Rivett-Carnac,Apr 2020,"When it comes to big life problems, we often stand at a crossroads: either believe we're powerless against great change, or we rise to meet the challenge. In an urgent call to action, political strategist Tom Rivett-Carnac makes the case for adopting a mindset of ""stubborn optimism"" to confront climate change -- or whatever crisis may come our way -- and sustain the action needed to build a regenerative future. As he puts it: ""Stubborn optimism can fill our lives with meaning and ...", (87K),"Transcript (24 Languages)Bahasa melayuDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSuomiTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Joseph Geni, TranslatorCamille Martínez, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:01I never thought that I would be giving 
my TED Talk somewhere like this. But, like half of humanity, I've spent the last
four weeks under lockdown due to the global pandemic
created by COVID-19. I am extremely fortunate
that during this time I've been able to come here to these woods
near my home in southern England. These woods have always inspired me, and as humanity now tries to think about
how we can find the inspiration to retake control of our actions so that terrible things
don't come down the road without us taking action to avert them, I thought this is a good place
for us to talk. And I'd like to begin
that story six years ago, when I had first joined
the United Nations. 00:47Now, I firmly believe
that the UN is of unparalleled importance in the world right now to promote collaboration and cooperation. But what they don't tell you when you join is that this essential work is delivered mainly in the form
of extremely boring meetings -- extremely long, boring meetings. Now, you may feel that you have attended
some long, boring meetings in your life, and I'm sure you have. But these UN meetings are next-level, and everyone who works there
approaches them with a level of calm normally only achieved by Zen masters. But myself, I wasn't ready for that. I joined expecting drama
and tension and breakthrough. What I wasn't ready for was a process that seemed to move
at the speed of a glacier, at the speed that a glacier
used to move at. 01:37Now, in the middle
of one of these long meetings, I was handed a note. And it was handed to me
by my friend and colleague and coauthor, Christiana Figueres. Christiana was the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change, and as such, had overall responsibility for the UN reaching what would become
the Paris Agreement. I was running political strategy for her. So when she handed me this note, I assumed that it would contain
detailed political instructions about how we were going to get out of
this nightmare quagmire that we seemed to be trapped in. I took the note and looked at it. It said, ""Painful. But let's approach with love!"" Now, I love this note for lots of reasons. I love the way the little tendrils
are coming out from the word ""painful."" It was a really good visual depiction
of how I felt at that moment. But I particularly love it
because as I looked at it, I realized that it was
a political instruction, and that if we were going
to be successful, this was how we were going to do it. So let me explain that. 02:40What I'd been feeling in those meetings
was actually about control. I had moved my life from Brooklyn
in New York to Bonn in Germany with the extremely reluctant
support of my wife. My children were now in a school
where they couldn't speak the language, and I thought the deal
for all this disruption to my world was that I would have some degree
of control over what was going to happen. I felt for years that the climate crisis
is the defining challenge of our generation, and here I was, ready to play my part
and do something for humanity. But I put my hands on the levers
of control that I'd been given and pulled them, and nothing happened. I realized the things I could control
were menial day-to-day things. ""Do I ride my bike to work?""
and ""Where do I have lunch?"", whereas the things
that were going to determine whether we were going to be successful were issues like, ""Will Russia
wreck the negotiations?"" ""Will China take responsibility
for their emissions?"" ""Will the US help poorer countries
deal with their burden of climate change?"" The differential felt so huge, I could see no way I could bridge the two. It felt futile. I began to feel that I'd made a mistake. I began to get depressed. 03:48But even in that moment, I realized that what I was feeling
had a lot of similarities to what I'd felt when I first found out
about the climate crisis years before. I'd spent many of my most
formative years as a Buddhist monk in my early 20s, but I left the monastic life,
because even then, 20 years ago, I felt that the climate crisis was already
a quickly unfolding emergency and I wanted to do my part. But once I'd left
and I rejoined the world, I looked at what I could control. It was the few tons of my own emissions
and that of my immediate family, which political party
I voted for every few years, whether I went on a march or two. And then I looked at the issues
that would determine the outcome, and they were big
geopolitical negotiations, massive infrastructure spending plans, what everybody else did. The differential again felt so huge that I couldn't see any way
that I could bridge it. I kept trying to take action, but it didn't really stick. It felt futile. 04:47Now, we know that this can be
a common experience for many people, and maybe you have had this experience. When faced with an enormous challenge that we don't feel we have
any agency or control over, our mind can do
a little trick to protect us. We don't like to feel
like we're out of control facing big forces, so our mind will tell us,
""Maybe it's not that important. Maybe it's not happening
in the way that people say, anyway."" Or, it plays down our own role. ""There's nothing that you
individually can do, so why try?"" 05:16But there's something odd going on here. Is it really true that humans will only
take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance when they feel they have
a high degree of control? Look at these pictures. These people are caregivers and nurses who have been helping humanity
face the coronavirus COVID-19 as it has swept around the world
as a pandemic in the last few months. Are these people able to prevent
the spread of the disease? No. Are they able to prevent
their patients from dying? Some, they will have been able to prevent, but others, it will have been
beyond their control. Does that make their contribution
futile and meaningless? Actually, it's offensive
even to suggest that. What they are doing is caring
for their fellow human beings at their moment of greatest vulnerability. And that work has huge meaning, to the point where I only
have to show you those pictures for it to become evident that the courage and humanity
those people are demonstrating makes their work
some of the most meaningful things that can be done as human beings, even though they can't
control the outcome. 06:37footnotefootnoteNow, that's interesting, because it shows us
that humans are capable of taking dedicated and sustained action, even when they can't control the outcome. But it leaves us with another challenge. With the climate crisis, the action that we take
is separated from the impact of it, whereas what is happening
with these images is these nurses are being sustained not
by the lofty goal of changing the world but by the day-to-day satisfaction
of caring for another human being through their moments of weakness. With the climate crisis,
we have this huge separation. It used to be that we were
separated by time. The impacts of the climate crisis
were supposed to be way off in the future. But right now, the future
has come to meet us. Continents are on fire. Cities are going underwater. Countries are going underwater. Hundreds of thousands of people are
on the move as a result of climate change. But even if those impacts are no longer
separated from us by time, they're still separated from us in a way
that makes it difficult to feel that direct connection. They happen somewhere else
to somebody else or to us in a different way
than we're used to experiencing it. So even though that story of the nurse
demonstrates something to us about human nature, we're going to have find a different way of dealing with the climate crisis
in a sustained manner. 07:54There is a way that we can do this, a powerful combination
of a deep and supporting attitude that when combined
with consistent action can enable whole societies to take
dedicated action in a sustained way towards a shared goal. It's been used to great effect
throughout history. So let me give you
a historical story to explain it. 08:16Right now, I am standing in the woods
near my home in southern England. And these particular woods
are not far from London. Eighty years ago,
that city was under attack. In the late 1930s, the people of Britain would do anything
to avoid facing the reality that Hitler would stop at nothing
to conquer Europe. Fresh with memories
from the First World War, they were terrified of Nazi aggression and would do anything to avoid
facing that reality. In the end, the reality broke through. Churchill is remembered for many things,
and not all of them positive, but what he did
in those early days of the war was he changed the story
the people of Britain told themselves about what they were doing
and what was to come. Where previously there had been
trepidation and nervousness and fear, there came a calm resolve, an island alone, a greatest hour, a greatest generation, a country that would fight them
on the beaches and in the hills and in the streets, a country that would never surrender. 09:20That change from fear and trepidation to facing the reality, whatever
it was and however dark it was, had nothing to do with the likelihood
of winning the war. There was no news from the front
that battles were going better or even at that point that
a powerful new ally had joined the fight and changed the odds in their favor. It was simply a choice. A deep, determined, stubborn
form of optimism emerged, not avoiding or denying the darkness
that was pressing in but refusing to be cowed by it. That stubborn optimism is powerful. It is not dependent on assuming
that the outcome is going to be good or having a form of wishful thinking
about the future. However, what it does is
it animates action and infuses it with meaning. We know that from that time, despite the risk
and despite the challenge, it was a meaningful time full of purpose, and multiple accounts have confirmed that actions that ranged
from pilots in the Battle of Britain to the simple act of pulling
potatoes from the soil became infused with meaning. They were animated towards
a shared purpose and a shared outcome. 10:23We have seen that throughout history. This coupling of a deep and determined
stubborn optimism with action, when the optimism leads
to a determined action, then they can become self-sustaining: without the stubborn optimism,
the action doesn't sustain itself; without the action, the stubborn optimism
is just an attitude. The two together can transform
an entire issue and change the world. 10:46footnotefootnoteWe saw this at multiple other times. We saw it when Rosa Parks
refused to get up from the bus. We saw it in Gandhi's
long salt marches to the beach. We saw it when the suffragettes said that
""Courage calls to courage everywhere."" And we saw it when Kennedy said
that within 10 years, he would put a man on the moon. That electrified a generation
and focused them on a shared goal against a dark and frightening adversary, even though they didn't know
how they would achieve it. In each of these cases, a realistic and gritty
but determined, stubborn optimism was not the result of success. It was the cause of it. 11:21That is also how
the transformation happened on the road to the Paris Agreement. Those challenging, difficult,
pessimistic meetings transformed as more and more people decided
that this was our moment to dig in and determine that we would not
drop the ball on our watch, and we would deliver the outcome
that we knew was possible. More and more people transformed
themselves to that perspective and began to work, and in the end, that worked its way
up into a wave of momentum that crashed over us and delivered many
of those challenging issues with a better outcome
than we could possibly have imagined. And even now, years later and with
a climate denier in the White House, much that was put in motion
in those days is still unfolding, and we have everything to play for
in the coming months and years on dealing with the climate crisis. 12:09So right now, we are coming through
one of the most challenging periods in the lives of most of us. The global pandemic has been frightening, whether personal tragedy
has been involved or not. But it has also shaken our belief
that we are powerless in the face of great change. In the space of a few weeks, we mobilized to the point where
half of humanity took drastic action to protect the most vulnerable. If we're capable of that, maybe we have not yet tested
the limits of what humanity can do when it rises to meet a shared challenge. 12:45footnotefootnoteWe now need to move beyond
this narrative of powerlessness, because make no mistake -- the climate crisis will be orders
of magnitude worse than the pandemic if we do not take the action
that we can still take to avert the tragedy that we see
coming towards us. We can no longer afford the luxury
of feeling powerless. The truth is that future generations will look back at this
precise moment with awe as we stand at the crossroads
between a regenerative future and one where we have thrown it all away. And the truth is that a lot is going
pretty well for us in this transition. Costs for clean energy are coming down. Cities are transforming.
Land is being regenerated. People are on the streets
calling for change with a verve and tenacity we have not seen for a generation. Genuine success is possible
in this transition, and genuine failure is possible, too, which makes this the most
exciting time to be alive. We can take a decision right now
that we will approach this challenge with a stubborn form of gritty,
realistic and determined optimism and do everything within our power
to ensure that we shape the path as we come out of this pandemic
towards a regenerative future. We can all decide that we will be
hopeful beacons for humanity even if there are dark days ahead, and we can decide
that we will be responsible, we will reduce our own emissions
by at least 50 percent in the next 10 years, and we will take action to engage
with governments and corporations to ensure they do what is necessary
coming out of the pandemic to rebuild the world that we want them to. Right now, all of these
things are possible. 14:24footnotefootnoteSo let's go back
to that boring meeting room where I'm looking at that note
from Christiana. And looking at it took me back to some of the most transformative
experiences of my life. One of the many things I learned as a monk is that a bright mind and a joyful heart
is both the path and the goal in life. This stubborn optimism
is a form of applied love. It is both the world we want to create and the way in which
we can create that world. And it is a choice for all of us. Choosing to face this moment
with stubborn optimism can fill our lives
with meaning and purpose, and in doing so, we can put a hand
on the arc of history and bend it towards the future
that we choose. 15:14Yes, living now feels out of control. It feels frightening and scary and new. But let's not falter
at this most crucial of transitions that is coming at us right now. Let's face it with stubborn
and determined optimism. 15:31Yes, seeing the changes
in the world right now can be painful. But let's approach it with love. 15:38Thank you."
2,What seaweed and cow burps have to do with climate change,Ermias Kebreab,Mar 2022,"Scientists have long known that cows are a huge source of the greenhouse gas methane, contributing up to four percent of emissions globally. But could there be a way to make cattle less -- ahem -- gassy? Animal scientist Ermias Kebreab talks through an ingenious solution to reduce methane-rich cow burps by feeding cattle something growing below the surface of the ocean: seaweed.", (55K),"Transcript (9 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Pasture is the single
largest type of land on the surface of the Earth today, thanks to our taste for meat and dairy. Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock. That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else. Most of that land is best for ruminants, such as cows, that can digest high-fiber feed
such as grass and straw. However, the process by which grass
and fiber is broken up in the stomachs of cows
and other grazing ruminants has a byproduct, methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Despite what you might have heard
about methane and cows, most of the methane
is actually burped out, not through the back end. 00:54(Laughter) 00:56And that represents
about two billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, or more than four percent of our annual
global greenhouse gas emissions. We have a methane problem from cows. 01:11So how can you reduce these methane burps? My colleagues and I
may have found a solution. Seaweed! Let me explain. A couple of years ago, an article was published
by Rob Kinley and colleagues that showed almost complete
elimination of methane when seaweed was added
to chopped grass in the lab. Great. But as an agricultural researcher, I know lots of additives
work well in the lab, but not in real animals. But there was something
different about seaweed and the way in which it reduced methane. So we thought we should
test this in live animals. In collaboration with Joan Salwen, an entrepreneur, and colleagues from
James Cook University and CSIRO, we decided to conduct a small experiment to determine the amount of seaweed
we might need to use. This was the first ever
experiment in dairy cattle, and we had no idea how much to give them. So we started with about 60 grams per day, going up to 250 grams. Mind you, this was mixed in
with 25 kilograms of their feed. One of the graduate students
I work with, Breanna Roque, trapped their methane burps. 02:33(Laughter) 02:34In that first experiment, the emissions were reduced
by up to 67 percent. 02:43(Applause) 02:48And I thought at first, the equipment must have
malfunctioned, but it was real. 02:53But we are left with more
questions than answers. Would the microbes
in the gut get used to it and start producing methane over time? Would the seaweed be stable
over a long period of time in storage? Would the taste be affected
and the cows turn up their noses? Or would the seaweed affect
the cows's health or milk production? 03:19So we teamed up again
to conduct another trial. Over a five-month period, we saw the seaweed
that was harvested three years prior reduce emissions by over 80 percent. 03:36(Applause) 03:41Our colleagues in Australia, they saw up to 98 percent
reduction in a similar trial. That kind of reduction
is simply staggering. And in the graph, you see methane emissions
in three levels of intake. So the first line
is for cattle with no seaweed, The second line is for cows that were supplemented
with about 30 to 40 grams of seaweed. And the last one is for cows supplemented with
about 60 to 80 grams of seaweed. As you can see, as you increase
the amount of seaweed, you see a reduction in methane emissions. 04:23We have also seen
an improvement in bulking up of the beef cattle
with no adverse health effects. So it’s a win for the environment; it's a win for the farmers and consumers. A panel of 112 people got to taste steak made from steers offered
seaweed and control. And they did not detect any difference. We also did a nutritional
quality of the meat, and we found no difference between
animals that were offered seaweed and the control. 04:57So how does it work? Some seaweeds contain ingredients that directly inhibit microbes
in the cow’s gut from forming methane without interfering with food digestion. The amount of methane produced is dependent on how much
the animal is eating and what's in the diet. And as such, previous efforts to reduce
methane emissions focused on changing their diets or improving forage quality. And we do have potential solutions
other than seaweed to reduce methane emissions. We looked at additives to feed,
such as 3-NOPs, reduce emissions by about 30 percent. Even garlic and citrus extract can reduce methane burps
by over 20 percent without affecting
animal health and productivity. 05:50Now you may ask: Why not stop eating
beef and drinking milk? 05:56Audience member: Yeah! 05:57(Laughter) 05:59EK: That would be a good question. So adopting a plant-based diet
with supplements may help shrink
a person's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the US. But, you know, a lot of people
are not going to do that. And for the rest of the world, these foods are needed
to provide key nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and vitamin A, which are critical for brain function, for vision and immunity. These are found almost exclusively
in beef and milk. In this graph, you see different countries with their annual meat consumption
per capita on the bar graph, and then you see the dots
representing the stunting rate in children below the age
of five years old. And countries that have lower
consumption of methane are associated with higher
incidence of stunting. 07:02I know this firsthand. Growing up in Eritrea, I loved milk and meat
when you could get it, which wasn't often. Even as a kid, I always wondered how a cow, eating just grass,
produces nutritious milk I love to drink. And that wonder pushed me
into a career to understand and improve livestock production so that people in low-income countries
do not suffer with stunting and other nutrient-deficiency diseases. 07:31(Applause) 07:37So what now? We know seaweed can work. But the cultivation of the specific
seaweed has been a barrier. It's not so easy to farm
asparagopsis taxiformis. But there are a number of efforts
going on at the moment to scale up production. Blue Ocean Barns is growing
seaweed in Hawaii already, and they estimate that there will be
enough production to feed all cattle in the US by 2030. All we need now
is for governments to step up and facilitate the use
of these methane-busting feed additives. Cattle industries in some countries have already committed
to climate neutrality by 2050. But if we can get these
feed-additive innovations into cow stomachs earlier, we can cut methane burps significantly. Given that methane only lasts
in the atmosphere for a decade or so, we could even slow global warming
in the short term. 08:41Yes, we have a methane problem from cows, but we may have seaweed
and other solutions for these methane burps, helping us provide meat and dairy
while maintaining a safe climate. 08:56Thank you. 08:57(Applause)"
2,The 55 gigaton challenge,Countdown,Oct 2021,This is the climate challenge we face: we need to go from putting 55 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases into the air each year to zero. And it all needs to happen by 2050 at the latest. How can we get there? This quick animated video explains. (Written by David Biello and voiced by Elise Hu), (12K),"Transcript (14 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)Leslie Gauthier, Translator00:01The air we breathe has changed. The mix of gases is shifting, with more and more greenhouse gases
like carbon dioxide. And this shift is happening
faster each year. In fact, concentrations of CO2
have reached levels never before breathed by humans, since Homo sapiens evolved. In just a few hundred years, eons of fossilized sunshine
have been burned as coal, oil and gas. The exhaust has transformed
the entire atmosphere and ocean. It’s like a pollution blanket, and the result we know
as climate change. 00:34So how much more of that fossilized
sunshine can we burn before further destabilizing
the Earth’s systems? Not much. Think of it as a carbon budget. We are currently adding 55 billion
metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere every year. This is the Gigaton Challenge. By some estimates, at that pace, we will have burned through
the remaining budget by 2030. So to give us some room to breathe, the world must reduce
greenhouse gas pollution by more than seven percent each year, every year of this decade ... starting now. 01:08There are a number of ways to do that. Let’s start by looking
at the greenhouse gases themselves. CO2 makes up nearly 75 percent
of the pollution emitted each year. There’s also nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, but it's no laughing matter, seeping out of farm fields and elsewhere and making up six percent of the problem. And then there’s methane, which you may also know of as natural gas. It’s 17 percent of the total. There are other greenhouse gases, but these three make up the bulk
of the climate challenge. All must be reduced -- and fast. 01:42Methane is better
at trapping the Sun’s heat, which means cutting methane pollution 
is a necessary and fast-acting stimulus for our carbon budget. If methane emissions from agriculture and the oil and gas industry
can be eliminated in this decade, we might be able to stave off catastrophes like the loss of the Arctic sea ice
and glaciers all around the world. 02:03CO2 has a longer life. Once it is added to the atmosphere, it can stay up there
for hundreds of years, if not longer. CO2 emissions
must be cut in half by 2030, and then reduced even further by 2040, to put the world on a path of adding no CO2 to the air by 2050. And that means transforming
the modern world as quickly as possible. 02:28There are several ways to break down
the sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Here we’re using the public
Climate Watch data. Start with energy. The majority of modern energy
comes from fossil fuels, which makes the energy sector
76 percent of the climate challenge, including the fuels
used for transportation, industrial processes and agricultural production. The shift to clean energy
must be accelerated by an order of magnitude if we want any chance to restrain
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And we’ll need more ways
to store this clean electricity, whether that’s putting it
in the chemical bonds of a battery or into a molecule of hydrogen. Batteries and clean hydrogen
are also going to play a key role in cleaning up transportation, which accounts for 17 percent
of climate-changing pollution, including the use of energy
to move people and goods around: eight percent from cars; five percent from trucks
and other heavy-duty vehicles; and four percent
from shipping and aviation. With abundant clean electricity, the world can win the race
to electrify cars and create cleaner
alternative fuels for trucks, ships, and even one day, airplanes. 03:38Then there are our lifestyles and the materials that make them possible. That’s everything from the cement
and steel that go into buildings to the plastic fibers in fashion. All told, these materials account
for six percent of our emissions -- on top of the energy emissions
required to produce them. And we’ll need new and clean ways
to make them or replace them. 03:59Farming and animal raising
also have to change as agriculture accounts for 12 percent
of greenhouse gas pollution. That means everything
from how and what people eat to how and what cows,
chickens and pigs eat. It also means finding ways for farm fields
to go from sources of greenhouse gas to places where
greenhouse gases get buried. Agriculture is also the biggest
direct impact people have on the plants, animals, microbes and fungi
that share this planet with us. To truly solve the climate challenge, the wild world will have to be
protected and restored to allow all of life’s myriad
forms to flourish. A halt in cutting down forests, burning peatlands and converting coastal wetlands could prevent the release of nearly five billion metric tons
of greenhouse gases each year. Restoring nearly 200 million hectares
of degraded forestland, peatland and wetlands could also absorb almost
another four billion metric tons. Perhaps even more importantly, the ocean has vast potential
to help reduce greenhouse gases ... if we protect it. 05:05Finally, there are technologies
being developed to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere because we have already emitted too much. But very few of these machine forests
have been deployed and they are too expensive
to scale up faster right now. 05:18This is the climate challenge we face: going from adding 55 billion metric tons
of greenhouse gases to the air each year, to adding zero by 2050, at the latest. The countdown begins now. 05:33(Music) 05:34[Countdown]"
2,A new economic model for protecting tropical forests ,Nat Keohane,Apr 2022,"To solve the climate crisis, we need to make tropical forests worth more alive than dead, says environmental economist Nat Keohane. Highlighting the urgent need to stop deforestation and the carbon pollution it brings, he details the work of the LEAF Coalition -- a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership that's channeling one billion dollars into protecting tropical forests -- and shares three building blocks for a robust market for forest carbon that enables economies to thr...", (48K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00footnotefootnoteTropical forests are one of the world's
most important carbon sinks, absorbing over one fifth of the emissions from burning fossil fuels every year. The latest research suggests
that without them the world would already be
nearly one degree Celsius hotter. We can't solve climate change
without tropical forests. But right now, instead of protecting forests,
we're cutting them down. Already, about one sixth
of the Amazon has been lost, and some scientists fear
that we're nearing a tipping point that could mean loss of the entire forest. Forests in Indonesia and Malaysia, even the vast forests of Central Africa,
are under threat as well. And deforestation means carbon pollution. In fact, tropical deforestation worldwide
accounts for almost as much emissions as all the world's cars
and trucks combined. So losing tropical forests
means losing any hope of limiting the rise
in global temperatures to 1.5 or even two degrees Celsius. 01:06The heart of the problem is economic. As long as it's profitable
to chop down forests for timber or clear them for agriculture,
we'll continue to lose them. Now, I'm not suggesting that we try
to halt capitalism in its tracks. We need to fix the market, not abandon it. We need a new and better economic
development model for tropical forest countries. And that means changing the incentives so that forests are worth
more alive than dead. If we can do that, we will drive investment
into tropical forest protection while also producing the goods
and services we need. 01:45This is the Amazon forest in Mato Grosso, a Brazilian state that's as large as Texas
and a chunk of California combined, and one of the world's largest
producers of beef and soy. Mato Grosso is now a model
of economic development and forest protection. But back in 2004, Mato Grosso was one of the world's
largest carbon polluters entirely because
of tropical deforestation. Since then, deforestation
is down over 85 percent. How? Well, Mato Grosso didn't reduce
emissions by shutting down agriculture. Instead, with support from the governments
of Germany and Norway, it stepped up enforcement
against illegal land grabbers. It empowered local communities
and indigenous populations to protect their territories. It worked with agricultural producers
and traders across the supply chain to invest in new and more sustainable
production methods. These efforts were supported
by a broad array of NGOs and businesses and Indigenous organizations. And they worked so well that when a new governor
was elected in 2018, he immediately affirmed his commitment
to reducing deforestation and continued the state’s policies. Because he saw how these new policies
were attracting new investment and laying the foundation
for sustainable growth. If we're going to stave off
climate catastrophe, the world needs many more Mato Grossos. 03:21Now, Mato Grosso began
its bold experiment with public funding. But if we're going to preserve
and extend those gains and scale them up to jurisdictions
around the world, we need a new and more durable
and much larger source of forest finance. And the key to unlocking that finance? Making forests worth more alive than dead. That means putting a value
on standing forests in a way that channels new investment,
hard cash, into sustainable green growth that protects the forests while supporting the livelihoods
of people who live there. It's a development model
that could make Brazil and Indonesia and other forest nations the world’s first
green economic superpowers, that allows them to capture the full value
of their natural resources. 04:15This is the goal of the LEAF Coalition. LEAF stands for Lowering Emissions
by Accelerating Forest finance. It's a coalition of 12 companies
and three countries that has committed
one billion dollars in finance for forest protection at scale
over the next five years, one of the largest-ever public-private
investments in forest protection. That first billion dollars will pay for 100 million tons
of emissions reductions, with the prospect of many
more billions to come. I have a special connection to this story because the idea that became LEAF was drawn up on a whiteboard
in my old office at Environmental Defense Fund
over eight years ago. Now, if I had been giving this talk then, it would have been purely theoretical. But that was before
the full success of Mato Grosso and before the key building blocks
that made LEAF possible were put into place. These three building blocks
are essential to any credible market. Accurate measurement, a standard for quality and a platform for transactions. 05:25First, credible forest transactions
require accurate and precise measurement, and thanks to advances in satellite
data and remote sensing, we can measure the amount
of carbon a forest contains and track changes in real time. 05:42The second building block
is a standard for quality so that buyers of emissions reductions can be certain they're getting
the real thing. At LEAF we use a new approach that focuses on the performance
not of individual forests, but of entire official jurisdictions,
like a state or nation. It builds in buffers
against risks like forest fire, and it requires countries, forest nations, to increase their ambition over time. 06:13The third and final building block
is a platform for transactions. We created a financial
intermediary called Emergent that connects sellers, forest nations that have emissions
reductions that they can sell, with buyers who include companies
that are looking to make good on their voluntary climate commitments. You put those three
building blocks together and you get a reliable and robust
market for forest carbon that enables economies to thrive
while protecting the forest. 06:46We know it's possible. In Mato Grosso, soy production more than doubled and cattle increased by over a quarter, even as deforestation plummeted. So the LEAF model promises
better outcomes for forests, better outcomes for the people
who live there and better outcomes
for the forest nations as a whole. 07:08But you may be asking,
what's in it for the companies? Well, now more than ever, companies see a business case
for climate action. Their customers are demanding it, their investors are, so are their employees. And companies recognize
that truly leading on climate means doing two things. First, reducing emissions in their own
operations and supply chains. And the companies that are part of LEAF have all been required to set
science-based targets for their own emissions. Second, they must contribute
to the broader fight. And one of the most important ways
that these companies, or any company, can help solve climate change
outside their own operations and supply chains is by protecting tropical forests. So that bears repeating. Companies in LEAF
are investing in forest protection over and above what they're doing
to reduce their own emissions. It's not a substitute, it's a supplement. Because if we're going
to solve climate change, we need to achieve both
deep cuts in fossil fuel emissions and dramatic reductions
in forest emissions. 08:23It took over a decade to put all
of the building blocks in place that made LEAF possible. And the results so far
are enormously encouraging. In the next ten years, if we can expand LEAF globally,
we can stop tropical deforestation, protect some of the largest
carbon sinks on the planet, and enable forest nations and local
populations to thrive and grow. All because we harness
the power of the market to reflect the full value
of standing forests and make them worth more alive than dead. 09:01Thank you. 09:02(Applause)"
2,3 ways your company's data can jump-start climate action,Massimo Russo,Mar 2022,"From helping build smart cities to supporting the sustainable energy sector, the possibilities of big data are endless. But many companies are still wary of sharing data that could expose them to risk and diminish their competitive advantage. What if uniting towards a common goal could help them overcome these fears? Data cooperation expert Massimo Russo shares three ways to jump-start a virtuous cycle of data sharing -- and how it can lead to better climate change solutions.", (48K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)00:01If you've gone to a tech conference, literally any tech conference
in the last five years, you would walk away with the impression
that the connected, easy-to-navigate, clean and green smart city
is just around the corner. The reality and the hype is that many companies are working
on products and solutions to get there. Take transportation, for example. Allegedly, in the city of the future you will be able to seamlessly plan
your journey from public transportation to shared autonomous taxis
and even electric scooters. If you own a car, it will be electric, and there will be charging stations
strategically placed throughout the city. So all you do is type
your location into your GPS, and it will automatically
take you to your location in the minimum amount of time and any payment you need for charging will be done automatically
in the background. 00:53Now you might say, wait a minute, there are companies
that are doing this today. I can do this today. But it’s individual companies, and it's certainly not ubiquitous
across the city. But it doesn't just stop
with transportation. Let's take health. In the future, there will be air-quality
monitors at every street corner, and they will be connected
with your asthma inhaler so that you know when it's safe to go out. Or there will be infrared cameras that are measuring the temperature
of citizens anonymously and that will be connected
with your thermometer so that we can detect future outbreaks. And of course, you will also have
your wearable device that connected to your bathroom scale
and your smart refrigerator so that nutritionists, doctors
and other companies can come up with new ways
to keep you, you know, slim and and trim as I am. Then of course, there's shopping. I mean, when you shop today, you know, you purchase from different retailers and you receive multiple shipments
during the course of the day. Now, if you had an app
where you could set your preferences and those shipments can be consolidated and maybe you receive
fewer shipments during the week, a little bit less convenient, but you get to reduce
your carbon footprint. 02:00So these are all great ideas
and solutions and products that companies are working on, but they all share
an underlying requirement that could make that smart city more of a distant dream
than a reality just around the corner. And that is the need for greater sharing
of data across companies, individuals and cities. And if there's one thing
that we've learned is that companies
don't like to share data, they don't even like to share
our own data with us. So let alone data
with competitors or partners. And therein lies the dilemma, because if we want to have a chance
at really combating climate change, we need to have our cities become
as smart and as connected as quickly as possible,
and as many cities as possible. So we need to overcome
this fear of data sharing and move towards the smart-city future. 02:55But why is it that companies
fear sharing data? Well, it’s what I call “FOMA”. Not FOMO, the fear of missing out
on a great party or either opportunity, but FOMA, the fear of missing out
on competitive advantage. Data is a source of competitive advantage. So why would companies want to give it up? 03:13In our research, over the last two years, we've been looking
at many different solutions that would improve the citizen experience and as well sustainability
solutions for cities. And what we found is that 85 percent
of those solutions require much more data sharing across companies, individuals and cities. 03:33So the question really comes, how do we motivate companies
to share more of their data? We need to actually
overcome this fear quickly if we want to make meaningful
progress on climate change. Well, as we talked
to a number of companies that were building platforms
and ecosystems in different verticals like logistics, transportation, smart buildings, smart cities, we asked about what it would take
to drive greater data sharing across these different solutions. And what we heard were the usual concerns: data sharing is costly, it’s complicated. And companies were concerned
about unintended disclosures that could risk their brand. However, there was one exception. And this, I think, is promising. Companies were more willing
to share their data if it could serve a broader common purpose
beyond commercial motivations. And in particular, they're more willing to share their data
beyond their own four walls if that data sharing could help
fight climate change. 04:31Let's take, for example,
a few car companies that actually are fierce competitors, and they got together and started to share detailed mapping data so they could develop better solutions
for routing trucks, so they spend less time idling and also could route trucks in a city based on prevailing
wind patterns to reduce smog. These are pretty cool solutions
that companies are working on. 04:53But the real question is, if this common purpose
of fighting climate change can help leaders overcome
their data sharing FOMA, how do we get them to actually do it? Well, in our work, we found
that it takes three actions to jump-start a virtuous cycle
of data sharing and innovation. First, companies need to look for new,
unexpected sources of data. Second, they need to develop new
sustainability solutions quickly. And third, they need to act
together for change. 05:28Let's take finding new,
unexpected partners for data. Well, what I mean by that is looking well beyond
the four walls of a company for sources of data that can be combined
with a company's own to analyze and develop
new sustainability solutions. But let me give a specific example. Let's take farming. Farming historically
has been more art than science. You've had farmers that make
decisions on when to plant, what fertilizer to apply,
when to irrigate, etc., based on their own personal experience
and knowledge of the farm. Do you remember ""Star Trek"" and when Spock could scan
the surface of a planet to know what the habitat was,
using the sensors from the “Enterprise”, and they could tell whether the planet
could support human life? Well, I know I'm dating myself
and I'm a bit of a geek, but that science fiction
is becoming a reality today. You have data from satellites, from drones, from sensors on the field, from connected farming equipment
that is collecting data. All of that can be combined so that farmers can make
better real-time decisions on how to improve their overall crop yield, reduce the amount of fertilizer
and other chemicals they need, and also conserve
scarce resources like water. So they can improve their income, lower their costs, and now they can even start
generating new income sources by planting carbon-absorbing crops
and getting paid for that. So really quite fascinating
what's happening in agriculture. 07:03Next comes innovating quickly
new sustainability solutions. What I'm talking about is not
your typical long product road map, but we need to have companies
hire data scientists that can analyze all these
different data sources and in new, agile ways, bring new products and services to market. We need to use data and digital quickly
to fight climate change. 07:27Finally, acting together. Now let me come back
to the smart-city example. If we had transportation
companies and utilities and buildings share data with the city, then the city could make better decisions
on investing in renewable energy projects. That could mean that you lower
your energy bill and also reduce your carbon footprint. Or that transportation data
can be used to decide where charging stations are needed so that we can accelerate the speed
of adoption of electric vehicles. And that means maybe you spend
less time in traffic, but also your air is cleaner. So to really make progress
on more sustainable energy, we need to have data sharing across
buildings, transportation and utilities. All of this data sharing needs to come
together for a brighter future. 08:18Now ... You also have a critical role to play. Of course, we individually need to be
in control of our own data. Imagine you have an app
that allows you to set preferences so that data from your car,
from your utilities, from your shopping patterns can be shared and you can make decisions
about your own carbon footprint in a very easy way. So you can run ""what if"" scenarios. What if I purchase an electric car? What if I take the train
from Boston to New York versus fly? Or what if I change my shopping pattern
so I shop more locally? How much will that impact
my overall carbon footprint? 08:52Would you be willing to share more data to have more sustainable climate and to make those
climate-friendly decisions? Well, I for one, I'm pretty
excited about this future, a future where greater data sharing can really help us
jointly combat climate change. What we need is for company leaders
to move away from FOMA and back to good old-fashioned FOMO. The future is bright
if all that data can be shared, and I don't think
we really want to miss out. 09:21Thank you. 09:22(Applause)"
2,How to make radical climate action the new normal,Al Gore,Nov 2021,"A net-zero future is possible, but first we need to flip a mental switch to truly understand that we can stop the climate crisis if we try, says Nobel laureate Al Gore. In this inspiring and essential talk, Gore shares examples of extreme climate events (think: fires, floods and atmospheric tsunamis), identifies the man-made systems holding us back from progress and invites us all to join the movement for climate justice: ""the biggest emergent social movement in all of history,"" a...", (76K),"Transcript (10 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoTiếng ViệtРусскийالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00footnotefootnoteSo the climate crisis,
in my way of thinking about it, is the most serious manifestation of an underlying collision
between human civilization as we’ve presently organized it and the Earth's ecological systems. And the system most in jeopardy is the very thin shell of atmosphere
surrounding our planet, because we're spewing 162 million tons
of human-caused global warming pollution into it every single day,
as if this is an open sewer. It's not an open sewer. It's so thin that if you could drive
an automobile at autobahn speeds to the top of that blue shell, you'd reach it in about five minutes. And that's where all
the greenhouse gases are. The accumulated amount, coming from the burning
of fossil fuels primarily, CO2 -- fastest-growing source of methane
is from fossil fuels as well, also, agriculture as you have heard -- the accumulated amount
traps as much heat now as would be released by 600,000
Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every day. 01:08footnotefootnoteSo the temperatures are going up
at almost record levels every year. Last year was the hottest year
in recorded history, according to NASA, and the scientists say it’s absolutely
unequivocal that we are the cause of that. And we’re hearing Mother Nature
and seeing the extreme events. The most anomalous extreme event
since records began 200 years ago was in the Pacific Northwest
of North America. Forty nine and a half degrees, 121 degrees Fahrenheit
in British Columbia. In the tropics and subtropics, the combination
of temperature and humidity is now making larger
areas literally uninhabitable, the area so described
is relatively small now, but if we continue
over the next few decades, these areas are predicted to expand, and billions of people will be in areas
where it is not safe to stay outside for more than a couple of hours. 02:07footnotefootnoteAlready, the climate refugees and migrants are four times more
from the climate crisis than from all the wars
and conflicts going on right now. And the respected “Lancet” commission has predicted as many as a billion
climate refugees in this century. That's one of the reasons
why we are seeing this wave of populist authoritarianism. 02:29Sea level rise is also
contributing, and of course, 93 percent of the extra heat
is absorbed in the oceans, and the ocean temperatures are reaching
record levels as well. And that means more water vapor
comes off the oceans, and the warmer ocean temperature
makes the cyclonic storms, like hurricanes and typhoons
much stronger. Hurricane Ida struck the Gulf Coast
as a category four, and as is so often the case, communities of color and poor people
were disproportionately victimized. This storm continued on
north and northeast across North America to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, killed a lot of people
and dropped rain bombs. And in New York City some basement apartments were flooded. 03:18And I appreciate this family giving me
the right to show this video. 03:26(Screams) 03:29He’s safe, the guy is screaming
for his mother. He and his mother were both
rescued by his brother, who punched a hole through the roof
from the floor above. 03:39footnotefootnoteThese rain bombs are becoming much more
frequent and much more extreme. And actually the water
coming off the oceans is held in much greater volumes
by the warmer air. Atmospheric rivers are becoming larger. Here's one, from Hawaii in the lower left to Silicon Valley in the upper right, 2,300 kilometers. What was happening in Silicon Valley
when this satellite picture was made? Well, that's what happens
when these rain bombs drop, and the average atmospheric river
now contains as much moisture as 25 Mississippi Rivers. They’re creating what you could call
“atmospheric tsunamis” in some areas. 04:18The downpours get much bigger
and much more frequent, four times more frequent now than in 1980. One of them dropped on Germany and neighboring countries in July, killed more than 200 people. Look at the before and after. This is an example
of what we're doing to our planet. Ten days ago, in part of Italy, there were 74 centimeters
that fell in 12 hours, 29 inches of rain in 12 hours. One year ago, October 3rd, as much rain fell here in the UK
as there is water in Loch Ness. And as a result, the insurance industry
is now seeing record recoveries, and those recoveries I showed you
from last year may get a tiny bit larger, depending on the outcome of this lawsuit. The owners and operators of this giant
replica of Noah's Ark have sued their insurance company
for a million dollars in flood damages. Hard to make some of this stuff up. 05:17(Laughter) 05:18footnotefootnoteThe same extra heat
is pulling the moisture out of the first meter of the soil, creating the worst droughts in memory. 93 percent of the American West
is in drought now, 100 percent of California, half of California is in the most
extreme form of drought, and the same heat is also
draining the reservoirs, evaporating the reservoirs. Lake Mead is down to levels
not seen since they started filling it in the 1930s. In Brazil, the same thing is happening. In Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic has been going through
the worst drought in at least 500 years. And in the southern cone of Africa, 100 million people
are experiencing food insecurity primarily because of
the extended droughts. 06:02footnotefootnoteAnd when the temperatures go up,
the fires get a lot worse and the worst fires in California
and western US history have been in the last two years. Also in Siberia, in Australia, in southern Europe. It doesn’t have to ruin your golf game. And this is a serious point, because we can't let these conditions
become the new normal. It's not fine. And this is an example
of why it's not fine. A lightning strike
hitting a natural gas leak in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Lightning gets more common
with the climate crisis. We're relying on dead plants and animals, leaving their residue in the atmosphere to threaten the species
that are still alive, and 50 percent of them are in danger
of extinction in this century. And as we push into previously
wild areas of the world, we encounter millions of new viruses that we have not dealt with in the past. Five new infectious diseases
every year, emerging, three quarters of them from animals,
like the COVID-19 pandemic. Which raises some of the same questions
that are raised by the climate crisis. When the world’s leading scientists are setting their hair on fire
to get our attention, should we listen to them? Check. Can our interconnected global civilization
suddenly be turned upside down? Check. Are the poor and marginalized populations
of the world the most affected? Check. Can science and technology give us nearly
miraculous solutions in record time? Check. Will we deploy those solutions in time? That is the question. 07:42footnotefootnoteWe have inequitable vaccine
distribution in the world, and it threatens everyone in the world. We also have solutions
to the climate crisis, but they're not equitably distributed. Worldwide, 90 percent of all
of the new electricity generation installed last year was renewables. Almost all of it from solar and wind. Just one year before the Paris Agreement, solar and wind electricity
was cheaper than fossil electricity in only one percent of the world. Five years later, two thirds of the world. Three years from now,
it will be the cheapest source in 100 percent of the world. Coal is not getting cheaper. Gas is not getting cheaper. Nuclear has been getting more expensive. Wind is cheaper than all three, and solar is continuing to plummet in cost
and is the cheapest of all now because the cost of making
the solar panels and the windmills continues to come down. By the way, the famous
coal museum in Kentucky just installed solar panels on its roof in order to save in its operating budget. 08:49(Applause) 08:51Now we're getting battery storage. I’ll rescale this graph to show you
the predicted emergence of a new one-trillion-dollar
industry in the next few decades and green hydrogen on top of that. The car batteries are getting cheaper as demand continues to increase. And within less than two years
in some model categories, the EVs will be cheaper than their internal combustion
engine counterparts and within four years
in all model categories. 09:20So, the oil and gas industry has been the worst investment
in global markets for more than a decade, while the clean energy companies
are really becoming more profitable. Now the oil and gas companies say that they're going to invest a lot more
in renewables and CCS. Yes, it’s the fastest-growing -- they’ve tripled their investments
all the way up to four percent. Ninety-six percent
of the money they’re spending is still going into oil and gas and coal. 09:51(Applause) 09:53footnotefootnoteThe impression they've given us
is not an honest impression, not for the first time. And they're telling a different
story to Wall Street. They still have planes, trains,
a few automobiles and ships, but they're telling Wall Street
and financial markets they're going to make it up in plastics, which is 75 percent
of their third-largest market, petrochemicals. How's that working out for us? Not so well. Banning single-use plastics is one
of the many things that we have to do. 10:24We have to shift to sustainability. And here's the good news, the sustainability revolution
is the single biggest business opportunity in the history of the world. It has the scale
of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed
of the digital revolution. And what we're seeing
is that we have to seize this opportunity, but we need reforms in the current
version of capitalism. 10:50footnotefootnoteCapitalism does a lot of things great. It balances supply and demand
and allocates resources efficiently and often unlocks a higher fraction
of the human potential. And by the way, the alternatives
on the left and right explored in the 20th century
didn't work out very well. But in order to see how we need
to change capitalism, we have to pull out our focus. And let me present an analogy. The electromagnetic spectrum
from the long radio waves to the short gamma rays
and all the things in between, the portion of visible light
that we can see with our eyes makes up only 0.1 percent of the total. For the eight years I worked
in the White House, I got a daily report
from the intelligence community that collected from all parts
of the spectrum, and it was a much more accurate picture. Here's the analogy. The value spectrum is something
we too frequently look at through the very narrow aperture
of short-term profits for one stakeholder, the shareholders. But this leaves out
negative externalities, as the economists call them,
like the pollution. That's why we need a price on carbon
and a price on plastic pollution. It also leaves out positive externalities. So we’re chronically underinvesting
in education and health care and environmental protection,
pandemic preparedness. We're ignoring the depletion
of resources like topsoil and underground water aquifers. And we’re ignoring the distribution
of incomes and net worths to the point where one
percent of the people have almost half of the world's wealth. That's one of the other factors
that's driving populist authoritarianism. We have to take account
of the environmental effects and the effects on people
and their families and the communities where they live and the communities in their supply chain and the ethics in the C-suites. And we have to realize
that hyper inequality is a threat to both capitalism
and to democracy. 12:51footnotefootnoteThere is an emergent form
called multistakeholder capitalism, and it is driving a lot of new decisions. For example, in asset management, almost half of all the assets
in the world under management are now in portfolios
committed to net-zero. One reason is that the Paris Agreement
set the direction of travel, where every country in the world
committed to net-zero. 13:16So just last May, the G7 nations banned financing
of coal plants overseas. And just three weeks ago,
China did, which is good, because they were financing most of them. I hope that they will cut down
on the coal chain in China domestically as well. And now more than half of all
the greenhouse gas emissions and two thirds of global GDP is coming from countries
that have set net-zero targets. 13:43So here's the hope. Once we reach net-zero, then with a lag time
of as little as three to five years, the temperatures in the world
will stop going up. And once we reach net-zero
within as little as 25 to 30 years, half of the human-caused CO2
will fall out of the atmosphere. 14:05It is as if we have a switch that we can flip in order to stop
the climate crisis. Regrettably, some damage has been done, but we can stop
the temperatures from going up and start the healing process. But we all have to flip this switch known as reaching net-zero. 14:28The young people
are telling us that we have to, and they're marching
in every country in the world. And what's the response? As recently as this morning we heard, ""Well, it may be impossible."" Well, it's not impossible. Nelson Mandela said, “It always seems
impossible until it’s done.” That's what they told the abolitionists. ""It's impossible to eliminate slavery."" That's what they told
the women's suffragettes. ""It's impossible to have
equal rights for women."" In the civil rights movement in my country and the anti-apartheid movement
in South Africa and more recently, the lesbian and gay liberation
and equal rights movement. 15:07We can do this. This is the biggest emergent
social movement in all of history. We can do this. And if anybody thinks
that we don't have the political will, remember, political will
is itself a renewable resource. 15:24Thank you very much. 15:26(Cheers and applause) Thank you."
2,The next wave of innovation in freight,Oren Zaslansky,Oct 2022,"Throughout the US, millions of freight trucks are buzzing goods across state lines, producing massive amounts of greenhouse emissions -- and some of them are only half full. Working to make this 400-billion-dollar-a-year supply chain process as efficient and sustainable as possible, freight expert Oren Zaslansky digs into the logistics of filling these trucks to their maximum capacity through algorithmic carpooling (think: ride-sharing your freight) -- bringing with it the potenti...", (4.3K),"Transcript (9 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBosanskiEnglishEspañolPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)00:01The supply chain, freight,
transportation, logistics, it's a trillion dollars a year. This is hundreds of thousands,
millions of loads of freight that are moving throughout
the United States every year. In terms of source of emissions
of greenhouse gases, it’s a massive producer. 00:15[In The Green: The Business
of Climate Action] 00:18[Presented by: TED Countdown
The Climate Pledge] 00:21[Oren Zaslansky
Company: Flock Freight] [Sector: Logistics, Location: USA] 00:27The global supply chain is roughly
broken up into what we call modes. By far the largest mode
is what we call full truckload. That is around a 400
billion-dollar-a-year mode in the US and in theory is the most efficient
way to move freight. But about half of the big trucks
you see on the highway, they're only running half full. If half of those trucks are only half full we burn the same amount of fuel,
the same amount of diesel, create the same amount
of greenhouse gas to run a truck half full as we do completely full. 00:57We're addressing that. We are getting those trucks full. We do algorithmic carpooling
of truckload freight. We've created a software solution
where you can ride-share your freight. They give us a little bit of data, and they say, ""I'm here today,
there tomorrow."" ""I'm empty.""
""I'm a quarter empty."" We take that data and we create
a more optimal outcome for that driver and for that carrier, which is just simply
those two basic things: the shortest distance between two points and making sure the truck is full, which also creates an income earning
opportunity for the driver. The driver has been paid to haul
a load that's only half full. We can create a world
in which they can have dynamic, fluid access to freight and revenue. The ability to kind of say,
""I want to opt in or opt out."" If I want to work a little more,
I can make a little bit more. 01:42As we scale, we will fundamentally
bring down the paradigm of modes and create even greater efficiency. The problem with these various modes, they are not integrated with one another. They don't share data, they don't share visibility. If we could find a way to share this data, then we could create
an entirely new supply chain that is much, much less resource-intensive
from a capital standpoint, from an infrastructure standpoint but also from a carbon standpoint. You would have a world in which
there were no longer any modes and everything would be
placed into the river and just flows where it needs to go. 02:16This is a massive opportunity for whether it's greenhouse gas
and sustainability or value and cost for the US supply chain. Through more data,
we have better insights, we make better decisions,
we build more valuable products. 02:29Change does not typically occur quickly. So I guess my advice to people
on the planet Earth is dream bigger, have higher expectations. The next wave of innovators are going to be focused
on neutralizing carbon. In doing so, they'll be the beneficiaries
of very valuable businesses that are also doing their part
to save the world."

With Greta Thunberg, Neubauer helped initiate ""Fridays For Future,"" the momentous international school strike movement that protests the lack of action on the climate crisis.

a climate activist. But things have changed, and now, standing here
as a climate activist, I ask you all to become one, too. Here's why, and most importantly, how. 00:18Ten years ago, when I was 13 years old, I first learned about
the greenhouse effect. Back then, we spent
90 minutes on this issue, and I remember finding it quite irritating that something so fundamental would be squeezed into
a single geography lesson. Some of this irritation remained,
so when I graduated from high school, I decided to study geography, just to make sure I was on the right track
with this whole climate change thing. 00:49footnotefootnoteAnd this is when everything changed. This was the first time
I looked at the data, at the science behind the climate crisis, and I couldn't believe what I was reading. Like many of you, I thought that the planet
wasn't really in a good state. I had no idea that we are rushing
into this self-made disaster in such a rapid pace. There was also the first time
I understood what difference it makes when you consider the bigger picture. Take the CO2 concentration
in the atmosphere, for instance, the number one driver for global warming. Yes, this looks bad. This looks like we are on
a pretty bad track. But it's only once you don't
just consider the last 60 years but the last 10,000 years that you understand
how terrifying this really is. And this is just one aspect
of the crisis we're seeing. I'm not going to get into details here,
but let me tell you so much: we are in a point of history that the most destructive force
on the planet is humanity itself. We are in a point of history that no scientist could guarantee you
that you will survive this. We are in a point of history that humanity is creating an environment that's not safe for humans anymore. 02:20Yeah, there I was, first year of geography, and felt pretty overwhelmed. But ... there was good news. The very same year
I first learned about all this, leaders from across the globe
came together in Paris to decide on the common target to limit
global warming to below two degrees. Pictures went around the world, and I was told that history
was made that day. How relieving, right? 02:52Except ... something didn't quite
work out about this. After this agreement was signed, things didn't really get better. Actually, they got much worse. Decision makers and industries,
leaders and politicians, they went back to business as usual, exploiting our livelihoods
like there is literally no tomorrow, building coal power plants
again and again, even though we know that needs to stop, according to the Paris Agreement. 03:30footnotefootnoteSo while there are also
good developments, of course -- there are installations of wind and solar
energy all over the globe, yes -- but these positive changes
are slow -- too slow, in fact. So since the Paris Agreement was signed, climate graphs keep racing to the top, smashing records every year. The five hottest years ever recorded were the previous five years, and at no time have global emissions
been higher than today. 04:03footnotefootnoteSo there I was, seeing and understanding
the science on the one side, but not seeing answers,
not seeing the action, on the other side. At that point, I had enough. I wanted to go to the UN
Climate Conference myself, that very place that was created
to bring people together to fix the climate -- except not really, apparently. This was last year. I traveled to the Climate Conference
and wanted to find out what this is really like,
what this is about. For political realists,
this might be no surprise, but I found it hard to bear: that fossil fuel industries
and political leaders are doing everything, everything
to prevent real change from happening. They are not keen to set targets
that are ambitious enough to put us on a below-two-degree pathway. After all, these are the only ones who
benefit from this climate crisis, right? The fossil fuel industry
generates profits, and political leaders, well,
they look at the next election, at what makes them popular, and I guess that's not asking
the inconvenient questions. There is no intention for them
to change the game. There is no country in the world
where either companies or political powers are sanctioned for wrecking the climate. 05:34With all the strangeness
and the sadness about this conference, there was one someone who was different, someone who seemed to be quite worried, and that was Greta Thunberg. I decided right there
that everything else seemed hopeless and didn't seem to make sense, so I joined her climate strike
right there at the conference. It was my very first climate strike ever and an incredibly strange setting, just me and her sitting there
at this conference hall, surrounded by this busyness
of the suit-wearing conference crowd who had no idea what to do with us. And yet, this felt more powerful than anything I had expected
in a very long time. And it was right there
that I felt it was maybe time to start striking in Germany. I was now certain that no one else
was going to fix this for us, and if there was just the slightest chance
that this could make a difference, it seemed almost foolish
not to give it a go. So I -- 06:45(Applause) 06:54So I traveled back to Berlin. I found allies who had
the same idea at the same time, and together we thought we'd give
this ""Fridays For Future"" thing a go. Obviously, we had no idea
what we were getting into. Before our first strike,
many of us, including me, had never organized a public demonstration
or any kind of protest before. We had no money, no resources and absolutely no idea
what climate striking really is. So we started doing what we were good at: we started texting, texting en masse, night and day,
everyone we could reach, organizing our first
climate strike via WhatsApp. 07:34The night before our first strike,
I was so nervous I couldn't sleep. I didn't know what to expect,
but I expected the worst. Maybe it was because
we weren't the only ones who had been longing to have a voice
in a political environment that had seemingly forgotten
how to include young people's perspective into decision-making, maybe. But somehow this worked out. And from one day to the other, we were all over the place. And I, from one day to the other, became a climate activist. 08:17Usually, in these kind of TED Talks, I would now say how it's overly hopeful, how we young people
are going to get this sorted, how we're going to save the future
and the planet and everything else, how we young people
striking for the climate are going to fix this. Usually. But this is not how this works. This is not how this crisis works. Here's a twist: today, three and a half years
after that Paris Agreement was signed, when we look at the science, we find it's still possible
to keep global warming to below two degrees -- technically. And we also see it's still possible
to hold other disastrous developments we're seeing, such as mass
extinction and soil degradation -- yes, technically. It's just incredibly, incredibly unlikely. 09:21footnotefootnoteAnd in any case, the world would have to see changes which we have never experienced before. We'd have to fully decarbonize
our economies by 2050 and transform the distribution of powers that is currently allowing those fossil
fuel giants and political leaders to stay on top of the game. We are talking of nothing less
than the greatest transformation since the Industrial Revolution. We are talking, if you want
to put it that way, we are talking of a climate revolution in a minimum amount of time. We wouldn't have a single
further year to lose. 10:02And in any case, for any
of that change to happen, the world needs to stop relying on one or two or three million school
strikers to sort this out. Yes, we are great,
we are going to keep going, and we are going to go to places
no one ever expected us, yes. But we are not the limit; we are the start. This is not a job for a single generation. This is a job for humanity. And this is when all eyes are on you. For this change to happen, we will have to get
one million things sorted. It's an incredibly
complex thing, after all. But ... there are some things that everyone
can get started with. 10:53Bad news first: if you thought
I would tell you now to cycle more or eat less meat, to fly less,
or to go secondhand shopping, sorry, this is not that easy. But here comes the good news: you are more than consumers and shoppers, even though the industry would like you
to keep yourselves limited to that. No; me and you --
we are all political beings, and we can all be part of this answer. We can all be something
that many people call climate activists. Yay? 11:27(Laughter) 11:29So what are the first steps? Four first steps that are essential
to get everything else done, four first steps that everyone
can get started with, four first steps that decide
about everything that can happen after. 11:45So what's that? 11:47Number one: we need to drastically reframe
our understanding of a climate activist, our understanding of who
can be the answer to this. A climate activist isn't that one person
that's read every single study and is now spending every afternoon
handing out leaflets about vegetarianism in shopping malls. No. A climate activist can be everyone, everyone who wants to join a movement
of those who intend to grow old on a planet that prioritizes
protection of natural environments and happiness and health for the many over the destruction of the climate
and the wrecking of the planet for the profits of the few. And since the climate crisis is affecting
every single part of our social, of our political and of our private life, we need climate activists
everywhere on every corner, not only in every room, but also in every city and country
and state and continent. 12:50Second: I need you to get out of
that zone of convenience, away from a business as usual
that has no tomorrow. All of you here, you are
either a friend or a family member, you are a worker, a colleague,
a student, a teacher or, in many cases, a voter. All of this comes along
with a responsibility that this crisis requires you
to grow up to. There's the company that employs you or that sponsors you. Is it on track of meeting
the Paris Agreement? Does your local parliamentarian know
that you care about this, that you want this to be a priority
in every election? Does your best friend know about this? Do you read a newspaper
or write a newspaper? Great. Then let them know you want them
to report on this in every issue, and that you want them to challenge
decision makers in every single interview. If you're a singer, sing about this.
If you're a teacher, teach about this. And if you have a bank account,
tell your bank you're going to leave if they keep investing in fossil fuels. And, of course, on Fridays,
you should all know what to do. 14:05Thirdly: leaving that zone of convenience
works best when you join forces. One person asking for inconvenient change is mostly inconvenient. Two, five, ten, one hundred people
asking for inconvenient change are hard to ignore. The more you are, the harder it gets
for people to justify a system that has no future. Power is not something
that you either have or don't have. Power is something you either take
or leave to others, and it grows once you share it. We young people on the streets,
we school strikers, we are showing how this can work out. One single school striker will always be
one single school striker -- well, Greta Thunberg. Two, five, ten, one thousand people
striking school are a movement, and that's what we need everywhere. No pressure. 14:59(Laughter) 15:00And number four, finally -- and this is probably the most
important aspect of all of this -- I need you to start taking
yourselves more seriously. If there's one thing I've learned during seven months
of organizing climate action, it's that if you don't go for something, chances are high that no one else will. The most powerful
institutions of this world have no intention of changing the game
they're profiting from most, so there's no point
in further relying on them. That's scary, I know. That's a huge responsibility, a huge
burden on everyone's shoulders, yes. But this also means, if we want to, we can have a say in this. We can be part of that change.
We can be part of that answer. And that's quite beautiful, right? 16:04So let's give it a try,
let's rock and roll, let's flood the world
with climate activists. Let's get out of the zones of convenience and join forces and start
taking ourselves more seriously. Imagine what this world would look like, where children would grow up, knowing their future was this one
great adventure to look forward to and nothing to be scared of, what this world would look like
when the next climate conference is this great happening of people
who come together, who had heard the voices of millions, who would then roll up their sleeves,
ready to create real change. 16:48You know, I dream of this world where geography classes
teach about the climate crisis as this one greatest challenge that was won by people like you and me, who had started acting in time because they understood
they had nothing to lose and everything to win. 17:16So why not give it a go? No one else will save the future for us. This is more than an invitation.
Spread the word. 17:23Thank you. 17:24(Applause)"
3,We need to track the world's water like we track the weather,Sonaar Luthra,Sep 2019,"We need a global weather service for water, says entrepreneur and TED Fellow Sonaar Luthra. In a talk about environmental accountability, Luthra shows how we could forecast water shortages and risks with a global data collection effort -- just like we monitor the movement of storms -- and better listen to what the earth is telling us.", (97K),"Transcript (15 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийУкраїнськаالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어00:00We need to build
a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively
demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. 00:11The first time I spoke at a conference
was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school,
little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions
I was going to be asked for the next decade. And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve
the world's problems -- more specifically,
the world's water problems -- with my technology. I had a lot to learn. 00:38It was seductive, believing that our biggest
water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster
and more affordable sensors. I was wrong. While it's true that
managing tomorrow's water risk is going to require better data
and more technology, today we're barely using
the little water data that we have. Our biggest water problems persist
because of what we don't do and the problems we fail to acknowledge. There's actually little question about what today's water data
is telling us to do as a species: we need to conserve more, and we need to pollute less. But today's data is not going to help us
forecast the emerging risks facing businesses and markets. It's rapidly becoming useless for that. It used to carry more value, but it's never actually told us
with any real accuracy how much water we have or what's in it. 01:49Let's consider the past decade
of water usage statistics from each of the G20 nations. Now, what these numbers do not tell you is that none of these countries
directly measures how much water they use. These are all estimates, and they're based on outdated models that don't consider the climate crisis, nor do they consider its impact on water. 02:16In 2015, Chennai,
India's sixth-largest city, was hit with the worst floods
it had seen in a century. Today, its water reservoirs
are nearly dry. It took three years to get here, three years of subaverage rainfall. Now, that's faster than most nations
tabulate their national water data, including the US. And although there were forecasts that predicted severe shortages
of water in Chennai, none of them could actually help us
pinpoint exactly when or where this was going to happen. This is a new type of water problem, because the rate at which
every aspect of our water cycle changes is accelerating. As a recent UN warning
this month revealed, we are now facing one new
climate emergency every single week. 03:14There are greater uncertainties
ahead for water quality. It's rare in most countries
for most water bodies to be tested for more than a handful
of contaminants in a year. Instead of testing, we use
what's called the ""dilution model"" to manage pollution. Now, imagine I took
an Olympic-sized swimming pool, I filled it with fresh water
and I added one drop of mercury. That would dilute down
to one part per billion mercury, which is well within what
the World Health Organization considers safe. But if there was any unforeseen drop
in how much water was available -- less groundwater, less stream flow,
less water in the pool -- less dilution would take place, and things would get more toxic. So this is how most countries
are managing pollution. They use this model to tell them
how much pollution is safe. And it has clear weaknesses, but it worked well enough
when we had abundant water and consistent weather patterns. Now that we don't, we're going to need
to invest and develop new data-collection strategies. But before we do that, we have to start
acting on the data we already have. 04:22This is a jet fuel fire. As many of you may be aware, jet fuel emissions play
an enormous role in climate change. What you might not be aware of
is that the US Department of Defense is the world's largest
consumer of jet fuel. And when they consume jet fuel, they mandate the use
of the firefighting foam pictured here, which contains a class
of chemicals called PFAS. Nobody uses more of this foam
than the US Department of Defense, and every time it's used, PFAS
finds its way into our water systems. Globally, militaries have been using
this foam since the 1970s. We know PFAS causes cancer, birth defects, and it's now so pervasive
in the environment that we seem to find it in nearly
every living thing we test, including us. But so far, the US Department of Defense
has not been held accountable for PFAS contamination, nor has it been held liable. And although there's an effort underway
to phase out these firefighting foams, they're not embracing safer,
effective alternatives. They're actually using
other PFAS molecules, which may, for all we know,
carry worse health consequences. 05:37So today, government accountability
is eroding to the point of elimination, and the risk of liability
from water pollution is vanishing. What types of incentives does this create
for investing in our water future? Over the past decade, the average
early stage global investment in early stage water technology companies has totaled less than
30 million dollars every year. That's 0.12 percent of global
venture capital for early stage companies. And public spending is not going up
nearly fast enough. And a closer look at it reveals
that water is not a priority. In 2014, the US federal government
was spending 11 dollars per citizen on water infrastructure, versus 251 dollars on IT infrastructure. So when we don't use the data we have, we don't encourage investment
in new technologies, we don't encourage more data collection and we certainly don't encourage
investment in securing a water future. 06:50So are we doomed? Part of what I'm still learning is how to balance the doom
and the urgency with things we can do, because Greta Thunberg
and the Extinction Rebellion don't want our hope --
they want us to act. 07:05So what can we do? It's hard to imagine life
without a weather service, but before modern weather forecasting, we had no commercial air travel, it was common for ships to be lost at sea, and a single storm could produce
a food shortage. Once we had radio and telegraph networks, all that was necessary
to solve these problems was tracking the movement of storms. And that laid the foundation
for a global data collection effort, one that every household
and every business depends upon today. And this was as much the result of
coordinated and consistent data collection as it was the result of producing
a culture that saw greater value in openly assessing and sharing everything
that it could find out and discover about the risks we face. 08:01A global weather service for water
would help us forecast water shortages. It could help us implement rationing
well before reservoirs run dry. It could help us detect
contamination before it spreads. It could protect our supply chains, secure our food supplies, and, perhaps most importantly, it would enable
the precise estimation of risk necessary to insure against it. 08:28We know we can do this because
we've already done it with weather. But it's going to require resources. We need to encourage
greater investment in water. Investors, venture capitalists: a portion of your funds and portfolios
should be dedicated to water. Nothing is more valuable and, after all, businesses are going
to need to understand water risks in order to remain competitive
in the world we are entering. Aside from venture capital, there are also lots of promising
government programs that encourage economic development
through tax incentives. 09:02A new option in the US
that my company is using is called ""opportunity zones."" They offer favorable tax treatment
for investing capital gains in designated distressed
and low-income areas. Now, these are areas that are also facing
staggering water risk, so this creates crucial incentives
to work directly with the communities who need help most. 09:24And if you're not looking
to make this type of investment but you own land in the US, did you know that
you can leverage your land to conserve water quality permanently with a conservation easement? You can assign the perpetual right
to a local land trust to conserve your land and set specific water quality goals. And if you meet those goals, you can be rewarded with
a substantial tax discount every year. 09:54How many areas could
our global community protect through these and other programs? They're powerful because they offer
the access to real property necessary to lay the foundation
for a global weather service for water. But this can only work if we use
these programs as they are intended and not as mere vehicles for tax evasion. When the conservation easement
was established, nobody could anticipate how ingrained
in environmental movements corporate polluters would become. And we've become accustomed to companies
talking about the climate crisis while doing nothing about it. This has undermined the legacy
and the impact of these programs, but it also makes them
ripe for reclamation. Why not use conservation easements
as they were intended, to set and reach
ambitious conservation goals? Why not create opportunities
in opportunity zones? Because fundamentally,
water security requires accountability. Accountability is not corporate polluters
sponsoring environmental groups and museums. Those are conflicts of interest. 11:12(Applause) 11:18Accountability is: making the risk of liability too expensive to continue polluting
and wasting our water. We can't keep settling for words.
It's time to act. And where better to start
than with our biggest polluters, particularly the US Department
of Defense, which is taxpayer-funded. Who and what are we protecting
when US soldiers, their families and the people who live near
US military bases abroad are all drinking toxic water? Global security can no longer remain
at odds with protecting our planet or our collective health. Our survival depends on it. 11:59Similarly, agriculture in most countries
depends on taxpayer-funded subsidies that are paid to farmers to secure
and stabilize food supplies. These incentives are
a crucial leverage point for us, because agriculture is responsible
for consuming 70 percent of all the water we use every year. Fertilizer and pesticide runoff are the two biggest sources
of water pollution. Let's restructure these subsidies
to demand better water efficiency and less pollution. 12:32(Applause) 12:38Finally: we can't expect progress if we're unwilling to confront
the conflicts of interest that suppress science, that undermine innovation and that discourage transparency. It is in the public interest to measure and to share everything
we can learn and discover about the risks we face in water. Reality does not exist
until it's measured. It doesn't just take
technology to measure it. It takes our collective will. 13:09Thank you. 13:10(Applause)"

for us to succeed, as I know a tool that I have seen worked to help reduce
the enormous environmental pollution. It is the power of transparency, pollution information made public using
mobile internet and other IT technologies may empower millions of citizens
to speed change by holding corporations
and government agencies accountable. 01:31I personally got involved
in the transparency drive for water pollution control. Years ago, beside Lake Tai, the third largest freshwater
lake in China, I saw a group of fishermen using long
ladles to scoop out the algae bloom. One fisherman said to me,
""When I was young, on a hot day like this, I would have jumped
into the lake for a [swim].” ""But now,"" he said, ""the fish are gone
and we're paid to scoop out the algae."" Pointing to those factories
not far from the shoreline, he said the lake would not be clean
until they stop dumping. 02:08Years of research made me understand
how hard it is to check the dumping. With weak enforcement, the cost of violations was often too low, and those who cut corners
became more competitive in the market. This region happens to be
one of the biggest centers of the global supply chain
for electronic gadgets and for clothes. But those multinational
brands sourcing locally were not very helpful at the beginning. Many would argue, ""In China,
I don't know who is polluting, so I would buy from the cheapest."" This is going to add further pressure
on those local suppliers to race down to the bottom
for their contracts. 02:51But I told them I have a map that can help them figure out
who is polluting. From 2006, we began to compile
corporate monitoring data data into a database
known as the Blue Map. We started with only two thousand
records of violations, but through years of promotion
of enforcement and transparency, that number has topped two million. The missing dots in the global supply chain's
environmental management began to be connected when a
group of [electronic] and textile brands started comparing their list of suppliers
with our list of violators. 03:33Let me explain how it works. This is the Blue Map
for the Yangtze River Delta, which covers the Lake Tai region. Each individual factory -- and there are tens of thousands of them -- is color coded. Blue and green for ""good,""
red and yellow for ""bad."" The color codes are derived
from the violations on record and the confirmed public reporting. And we have put more
than four million of such dots on the digital map, all color coded. 04:06Still, how can a map make change? This is one of the largest
dyehouse suppliers. It used to have multiple
violation records, but insisted if they treat the waste
but not their neighbors’, they would lose their business. But then five brands, starting from Gap, all told this company
it would lose their business if it would not treat the waste properly. Realizing that the sourcing
code has changed, the company spent millions of dollars to bring more than 12 million metric tons of textile wastewater
contaminated by dyes and chemicals up to standards, and then made further investments
to cut the volume of wastewater. 04:53We did the same thing, along with our local partners,
such as Green Jiangnan, with the electronic industry suppliers that manufacture parts for Apple, Dell,
Huawei and other major brands. Here is one of the largest 
[electronic] suppliers, dredging the local canal to remove
the heavy metals dumped in it. 05:20Victories like this build upon each other to enable the supply chain management
to reach further upstream through the supply chain, from garment factories to fabric mills
to dyehouses to the dye manufacturers. Today, the color codes
can mean the difference between a company that secures a loan
from a major bank, like the Postal Bank of China, and one that does not. The application of the Blue Map data,
in green supply chain and green finance, has motivated more
than fourteen thousand companies to address their violations
or make disclosure. 05:59The scope of environmental transparency
got further extended in China during its epic fighting
against the severe smog, which used to expose hundreds
of millions of people to health hazards. In response to the public
demand for disclosure, corporate online monitoring data were made
open every hour or every two hours. The first of its kind in the world. At the same time, people were acquiring
cell phones across China, so we developed a cell phone app to enable people to access the air
and water quality data. But the most unique function
of the Blue Map app is for our users to access
the records of emitters, then share through social media,
tagging the official account. Such kind of a microreporting has motivated some of the largest
emitters to change behavior. 07:00This is one of them, a listed steel plant which used to breach
the standards repeatedly. The microreporting filed by the local
Blue Map users and NGOs has got a local agency to weigh in
and require this company to clean up. Eventually, the steel plant spent
more than one billion dollars to make a very deep cut 
in its air emissions, a contribution to the significant
improvement of air quality in a vast airshed,
which includes my city, Beijing. 07:36Despite all the successes, I have to acknowledge our mission
is far from being accomplished. There are still more than two million
records of violations in the Blue Map. Today, we face massive tension between environmental protection
and economic recovery, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the looming
climate catastrophe. There's a strong temptation,
In local regions and cities, to relax environmental regulations, which has resulted already in a rather
big rebound of the carbon emissions. 08:16So China's 2060 carbon neutrality pledge
came at a critical moment. But the implementation of it
wouldn't be easy. Remember the steel plant that already
spent one billion dollars to clean up? Now the new task is for us
to review with it how to tackle the 10 million metric tons
of carbon emission. And this is just zero point one percent of the carbon emissions that we need
to stop or neutralize in China. Again, we must tap
into the power of transparency. 08:55My team and I have launched
a Blue Map for Zero Carbon, a database that needs to bring
China's long-term national commitment down to where that 10 billion tons
of carbon are actually emitted. This is how a zero-carbon map looks like. Each province and city is color-coded
based on its level of emission. With trend analysis, tracking when and at what level
the carbon will peak and stop growing. As you can see, the cities of Beijing,
Shanghai, are on track, while others like Tangshan, like Yinchuan,
still have a long way to go. 09:36To generate peer pressure and incentives,
we're working with our partner, the Chinese Academy
of Environmental Science, in assessing the local climate ambition, performance and carbon-decoupling
trends of major provinces, cities and energy
and raw-material companies. One clear gap we identified is the lack of capacity
in measuring and reporting. Along with other partners, we developed a digital carbon
accounting platform. So far, more than five thousand companies
have been motivated by brands and banks to calculate and report
their carbon emissions or local emissions. 10:20But my dream is to empower
millions of more businesses, to measure and to report
and to reduce their emissions. Bear in mind many of them
are part of this global supply chain. If you know the product you consume
day in and day out, often has 70 percent or more, and sometimes to up to 90 percent,
of their carbon footprint in the supply chain, would you join our efforts
in motivating the big brands and banks and investors to green their global sourcing
and investment? 10:56And it's not just carbon. Today, we further expand the Blue Map to cover waste and plastics 
and even biodiversity so as to empower more people to join this unprecedented global race to zero. The prize for winning this ongoing race
is nothing less than a better world for this generation
and for the generations to come. For mankind and for all
the plants and animals that call this planet their home. 11:35Thank you."

In this essential talk, she highlights the interdependence of environmental and human health and emphasizes the necessity of placing health at the heart of all climate solutions.", (52K),"Transcript (10 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroTiếng ViệtРусскийالعربية中文 (简体)FootnotesFootnotes00:01I grew up in Bokaro Steel City
in eastern India, an industrial townships surrounded by power plants
and steel smelters. One of my fondest memories as a child was to stare in the evenings
at the beautiful orange skies and flaring chimneys of the steel plant. Little did I know at that time that these were all classic signs
of severe air pollution. 00:26Cities like Bokaro were dubbed
as the temples of modern India that propelled the country
into the 21st century. 00:34I now work at the intersection
of environment, health and justice. I've been in the space
for nearly two decades, and my experience tells that the negative impacts
of industrialization have outweighed the good. I've also in my work come across
several individuals and groups who, despite all odds, go beyond their call of duty
to serve their communities. I find health care professionals
working in polluted places, as one such group who strive
to do everything they can to protect their patients
and communities from risk. For example, Meena, a health worker
from Korba district in central India. Her job is to provide maternal care
to pregnant women. However, Meena lives in a region that is surrounded
by coal and power plants and is considered among the top five
critically polluted places in India. So Meena also gives advice on how to protect the newborn children
from the dangers of air pollution. 01:41footnotefootnoteMeena and thousands of other
health workers in India and across the world apply a concept that has been with us
since at least the fifth century BC when Hippocrates, the Greek physician, also considered as the father
of modern medicine, wrote about the role of physicians
in his book ""Of the Epidemics."" He said, and I quote, ""The physician must be able
to tell the antecedents, know the present and foretell the future. Must mitigate these things with two special objects in view
with regard to disease. Namely, to do good or to do no harm."" 02:26The doctrine of ""do no harm"" forms the basis of the Hippocratic Oath, one of the oldest and most widely
known codes of ethics. Now the recitation of the Hippocratic
Oath may be symbolic today, but most health professionals
adhere to it daily, as we have witnessed in the last two years
of the COVID-19 crisis. 02:46I am here to make a case for two things -- placing health at the heart
of climate solutions and placing the philosophy
of “first, do no harm” at the heart of all decisions
beyond health, including those taken
by our CEOs and politicians. 03:05(Applause) 03:10footnotefootnoteNow let me be clear about one fact. The climate crisis is a health crisis. It threatens our air, water,
food, shelter, security, all the basics on which
the human life depends. Burning of fossil fuels
for electricity, heat or transport is a major driver for climate change and a main contributor to air pollution. Globally, air pollution causes seven million premature deaths each year. That's 13 deaths every minute. Way more than the death toll of COVID
by the end of summer of 2021. And the poor and the marginalized
are more severely impacted. 03:56Now extreme climate events
not only threaten people’s health but health care's own infrastructure
and capacity to respond. The deadly floods of 2018
in Kerala, in India, the state that I live in, forced hospitals to evacuate patients, suspend surgeries and critical care. Others faced power outages, many reported destruction
of the entire stocks of vaccines and medical supplies. And similar experiences have been
documented in other parts of the world. 04:27Now there’s also a paradox here,
and with it an opportunity arises. While the health sector
plays a central role in responding to the climate crisis, the sector itself contributes
to nearly five percent of the net global greenhouse
gas emissions and growing. Health care professionals understand the seriousness of their own
climate footprint. In the last couple of years, we have seen an enormous
momentum within the sector in charting a course
towards transformative healthcare that starts with climate solutions. 05:03This momentum is guided
by a zero-emissions, climate resilience,
and health equity road map. For example, the state
of Chhattisgarh in India has solarized over 900
community health centers and pledged to attain
100 percent solarization to provide energy access, thus anchoring the resilience
of the community and protecting the most vulnerable. Last year, India’s
National Health Service began charting a course
to zero emissions by 2045. This year, 40 institutions representing
3,000 hospitals in 18 countries followed suit and worked with Health Care Without Harm
to decarbonize health care -- its buildings, its operations
and supply chain -- in a race to zero. Doctors for Clean Air and Climate Action is mobilizing thousands
of doctors across India on the issue of air pollution and health
to advocate for better policies. 06:02Time has come that we measure
the advancement of our civilization through the metric of health
rather than metric of wealth. But here also -- 06:14(Applause) 06:17But here also lies
one of our biggest roadblocks: it is impossible to have
healthy people on a sick planet. 06:28The blatant disregard for environment, which is entrenched in our current
economic and social models, has pushed the natural
world to its limits. Failure to ask basic questions like who is this business
decision going to harm, or what is the impact
of the current policy choice on the most marginalized or on the future generations has brought us to this crisis. COVID-19 is a clear example of our
broken relationship with nature. It has also shown
the deep interconnections between the health of the planet
and human health. We need to urgently mend
our relationship with the planet, and this is where the principle
of “first, do no harm” in decisions becomes critical. 07:15Now let me clarify one point here
because I don't want any ambiguity. When I say ""do no harm,"" I do not mean that we should not
explore bold and courageous solutions. We desperately need to be innovative
in the face of crisis. But there is a lot of bad, wrongful, harmful and unjust behavior
that happens knowingly, and that needs to stop. 07:43(Applause) 07:48The overarching theme
of the Hippocratic oath is the idea that the individual
who is reciting the pledge is making a personal dedication
to ethical and committed care and putting their patients first. In Korba, Meena embodies this philosophy. She's doing her bit
in protecting her community. However, that is not enough. The scale of challenges that we face today demands that all of us,
individually and collectively, independently of our position,
power, agency or resources adopt a similar dedication and commitment. 08:28And as a first step, we must all include the principle
of doing no harm in all decisions, big and small,
for all present and future actions, and put the health
of our planet and ours first. 08:46Thank you. 08:47(Applause)"
3,"The ""greenhouse-in-a-box"" empowering farmers in India",Sathya Raghu Mokkapati,Feb 2022,"For smallholder farmers in India, agriculture has long been an unreliable source of income -- crops that flourish one season can fail the next, thanks to heat, pests and disease. But climate risk is now making the profession nearly impossible. TED Fellow Sathya Raghu Mokkapati is determined to change that with ""greenhouse-in-a-box"": a small, low-cost, easy-to-build structure aimed at helping farmers weather sizzling summers, increase monthly revenues and grow more food with less w...", (51K),"Transcript (8 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolMagyarTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01When we look at poor
smallholder farmers across the world, and particularly in my country, India, we often think that what they need
is access to better tools, education, government support,
markets and so on. Yes, they need all that. But what they really need
is a reliable and regular income to live with dignity. A dependable income, even if it is as small
as 100 dollars a month, is essential for them
to stay out of poverty. Today, their incomes
are in and out of poverty, which is extremely painful. 00:45Growing up in South India, I could not overlook
what poverty did to our farmers. I was about 17 years old when one day, I saw a farmer in my village
sitting next to a farm stream and eating something from the ground. Something did not seem right. I walked up to him
to see what was going on. I was shocked to see him eat mud. Mud. Brown, soft mud from the stream. I was afraid he might die. I yelled at him. ""What is this stupid mud-eating business?"" He looked at me helplessly and said, ""I'm a farmer, my crops failed; my stomach doesn't know
that my pocket is empty."" 01:41I walked away quite helplessly. That night, I shared this
with my grandfather. He was a remarkable man, very clever. He was a part of the Indian
freedom struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Unlike me, he wasn't surprised at all. He knew of people
who added rice starch to mud to calm their hunger. And he told me something profound. If you see a person walking
on the road without footwear, it is important to understand
the root cause: that the person doesn't have enough money
to probably buy the footwear. 02:19I finished my college, started working with a big company, but that incident kept coming back to me. Why are smallholder farmers
in such abject poverty? What causes them to be so desperate, and why is it that,
even in 21st-century India, one farmer dies by suicide
every 51 minutes? 02:40My cofounders and I spent about six months
traveling across India, meeting hundreds of farmers
to listen to them. It became clear that climate risk
is the root cause that causes farming to be
unpredictable and unviable. Farmers who make
reasonable money in one season can fail miserably in the next. And farmers who could grow crops
earlier in summers no longer get to grow crops in summers. Heat is so much more. The wells are drying up, every year, there are new varieties
of pests and diseases. Farmers told us that this is all
because of because of God. 03:23I said, ""What?"" 03:24""This is all because of God."" God is the one who caused it,
God is the only one who can solve it. 03:30God, in that context,
I did not see as a sign of hope. I read it as a sign of helplessness. We heard from the farmers. They knew the problem, but they could not use
these two words: ""climate risk."" 03:49So we got together a team of engineers, scientists, designers
from about six countries, to cocreate a solution with our farmers, which is quite unconventional. And the solution is “greenhouse-in-a-box.” 04:07We call it ""Kheyti Rakshak."" It’s a micro-greenhouse. It's a beautiful greenhouse which sits in a small portion
of the farmer's land. It's easy to build, a small structure, covered with netting on all sides, which cuts off heat,
prevents bugs and saves water. We can't cool the entire
planet in one day, but we definitely can create a climate
for a small portion of a farmer’s land to be suitable for farming. From our first experiences
of growing vegetables -- staple vegetables like tomatoes,
cabbage, cucumbers -- we observed that greenhouses
can increase yields up to seven times and use 90 percent less water. All this was too good to be true. All these things
are so difficult to happen, so farmers couldn't believe it,
unless they actually saw it in action. 05:06So to make this happen, we had to have the courage
to reimagine agriculture -- reimagine agriculture
for smallholder farmers. After all, this is not to grow tomatoes
in an industrial setting in Alaska in winters. It is to grow tomatoes
for a smallholder farmer, by a smallholder farmer,
in sizzling hot Indian summers. So this greenhouse had to be small enough
to fit in a portion of their land, easy enough for them to use and cheap enough for them to buy. 05:45One of the biggest challenges
that we could overcome in the process is financing. Thanks to our financing partners, today, this greenhouse
is available with financing which is fast enough and cheap enough. The greenhouse costs about 1,000 dollars. Farmers pay a down payment
of about 100 dollars, and the rest is financed through a loan. And this life-changing asset adds and extra 100 dollars of profit,
on average, to a household, month on month. This is a good double
of what they otherwise make. Marginal, five-ten percent increases
in the incomes of smallholder farmers cannot move the needle forward much, because the baseline is way too low. We need a significant
jump in their income, and that income has to be
reliable and dependable. To ensure that farmers succeed, we also provide quality seeds, nutrition, training and advisory
leveraging mobile technology. We rolled out the solution,
after quite a few tests with farmers, about three years ago, and we are marching towards
2,000 farmers in this year and looking at 100,000 farmers
over the next five years. Hopefully, every smallholder
farmer in my lifetime. 07:13(Applause) 07:19The best technologies in agriculture
can reach the smallest of the farmers if we do two things well: listen to the farmer with curiosity,
empathy and compassion, and keep smallholder farmers,
particularly women farmers, at the center of the design, and build solutions. Then, we can cocreate
mini solutions like Kheyti Rakshak, which bring dignity, hope and stability
to the lives of the farmers. In this big fight against climate change, we all have to remember that we should
take our smallholder farmers along; it is our collective responsibility. 08:01India is a home for about 100 million
smallholder farmers. I dream of a day when ""smallholder farmer"" becomes
synonymous with a happy farmer, and being forced to eat mud
should never be a feature again, anywhere. 08:22Thank you. 08:23(Applause and cheers)"

Plastics come in all shapes,
forms and colors. They are everywhere. They are in our makeup, it packages our food and insulates our homes. They are in airplanes
and our favorite electronic devices. They are truly a remarkable material. 00:20But so are its troubles. And we produce and consume plastics
in staggering quantities. Since it's been mass-produced, the world has created
over 10 billion metric tons of it. Half of them just in the past 20 years. 00:38I have been investigating
plastic pollution [for] about a decade, and I try to align my personal
choices as a consumer with the aspirations of my research. And you may think, “Oh, that’s easy,
you know how to do it.” But actually it’s not. Sometimes it's impossible
to avoid single-use plastics. The system is built that way. 01:03The dominant narrative about plastics
tell us that this is a consumer’s and a waste management problem. Who of us here have not heard about the tales
of gigantic plastic islands floating in the middle of the ocean? Which, by the way, it's not true. And that low-income countries are to blame for most of the plastic waste
entering our oceans. But this narrative is a misleading
oversimplification of a much bigger and complex story. 01:35Plastics and their chemical additives are really a climate problem. 01:42Now, we need to think of plastics
from a systemic perspective. So let me take you through
the journey of plastics. Plastics contribute to climate change
from before the moment they are produced to long beyond the moment
they are disposed or landfill or drift into the ocean. And it will remain
in the environment for centuries, degrading ecological processes. 02:12For 99 percent of all plastics the starting point
is fossil fuel hydrocarbons. Oil, gas and coal are extracted
and refined to produce plastic and other synthetic chemicals. And those processes generate greenhouse
gases such as CO2 and methane. Studies indicate that if nothing is done, the production of single-use plastic alone
will contribute to more than 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 02:45And the thing is that our use of plastic
last often just a few minutes or a few hours, then we throw them away, and that generates further emissions. And we know that our recycling
system doesn't work. It's broken everywhere. And recycling plastics is hard
and not cost-competitive. Most of the waste
that has not been landfilled or incinerated domestically is shipped across the planet, and it reaches low-income countries where they are expected to be recycled. But this is one of those
hypocrisies of globalization where rich countries outsource
their problems to low-income countries. And we know that these countries
do not have the capacity nor the technology to deal with them
in a soundly manner. And so huge amounts of plastics
are illegally incinerated, informally dumped or get lost at sea. And as a result, millions of tons of plastic every year
get into our environment. But even plastics that are soundly managed emit greenhouse gases. 04:02Once plastics enter the environment,
landfill, are dispersed in soil or water, they start a process of breaking down
into micro and nanoparticles. I will just call them microplastic
for the sake of the conversation today. And this process of breaking down
emits powerful gases such as methane, ethylene and CO2. And that's true for both traditional and biodegradable plastics. On the surface of microplastics,
new microbial communities can grow. We call them the plastisphere. And their biological activity
also releases additional CO2 and nitrous oxide into the environment, creating the possibility of further
magnifying the climate problem. It means that microplastic
can also impair the growth and the photosynthesis capacity
of phytoplankton, which are the microorganisms producing
much of the oxygen we breathe. But also microplastics
can have toxic effects on zooplankton, and the health of these organisms [is] essential for the functioning
of all aquatic food webs. 05:20And unfortunately, the problems
run even deeper. Microplastics bind with
the so-called marine snow, which are made out
of the clumps of bacteria, plankton and other organic material
that sinks down into the ocean depth, acting like a biological carbon pump. But microplastics risk
affecting this marine snow and potentially decreasing
the capacity of the ocean to absorb and sequester carbon
from the atmosphere. And microplastics can be decreasing
the reflective properties of snow and ice, potentially accelerating the melting
of glaciers and polar ice. 06:02So we have early enough indications that plastic pollution is starting
to change the processes that allow the Earth's
climate system to work. And this pollution is not
a localized phenomenon. Microplastics are everywhere, from the mountaintops of Everest to the deepest sediment
in the Mariana Trench. They are in the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. They are now found
in our bloodstream and our lungs. And personally, the most terrifying, in the placenta of our unborn children. 06:42Now, of course, plastic
is a great material, it's versatile and durable, and in many ways it has allowed
modern civilization to develop in the way it has. But it also comes with a lot of problems and the outlook is worrying. Today, the total mass of plastic is twice the total mass
of all living organisms on the planet. But still, fossil fuel companies see hydrocarbon as their
primary growth sector projecting a 30 percent increase
of virgin plastic for single-use plastic just in the next five years. We already see an accelerating pace
in producing and releasing new chemicals because there are many,
many kinds of plastic. Each one the result of a different
chemical formula. And we know that this is incompatible with staying within the safe
operating space for humanity. And given how plastics impact the climate and the world's social ecological system, this would spell a catastrophe. 07:52By the way, I'm not saying
that we are completely doomed yet. There are solutions. And it’s that worldwide,
entrepreneurs and companies are creating new designs and material that can substitute
traditional single-use plastic. And social movements are consolidating and educating people
to reduce their plastic footprint and pressuring local
and world policy makers to enact strong policies. And scientists are
collaborating more than ever, communicating the urgency
to limit not only the volume, but the chemical diversity of plastics. And earlier this year, representatives from over 170 nations
at the UN Environment Assembly adopted an initiative
to end plastic pollution, committing all these countries
to participate in creating, by 2024, a legally binding agreement that addresses the full
life cycle of plastics, from production to design to disposal. 08:55We need to stop thinking of plastic
just as a waste problem, one that can be solved by changing
consumers's habits alone and stopping using plastic bags. We need to think of plastics
as a climate problem, as a product that creates damage
along all its journey, from the drilling up of hydrocarbons
to the spread of microplastics. And that can only be addressed
in a systemic way. 09:22Thank you. 09:23(Applause)"

fixed amount of value that exists, rather than working to generate new value. 01:03That raises the question: is infinite growth possible 
on a finite planet? 01:09We measure economic growth by tracking 
the total financial value of everything a country (or the world)
produces and sells on the market. These products can help 
us meet basic needs or improve our individual and collective 
quality of life. But they also, crucially, take resources 
to invent, build, or maintain. 01:30For example, this smartphone. It’s valuable in part because it contains
aluminum, gallium, and silicon, all of which took energy and resources
to mine, purify, and turn into a phone. It’s also valuable because of all
the effort that went into designing the hardware 
and writing the software. And it’s also valuable because a guy 
in a black turtleneck got up on stage and told you it was. 01:54So how do we grow 
the total financial value of all things? One way is to make more things. Another way is to invent new things. However you do it, growing the economy 
requires resources and energy. And eventually, won’t we just run out? 02:13To answer this question, let's consider
what goes into the economy and what comes out of it: its inputs are labor, capital—
which you can think of as money— and natural resources,
like water or energy. Its output is value. Over the past 200 years, economies have
gotten exponentially more efficient at producing value. 02:36If we, as a species, 
are able to keep upgrading our economies so that they get ever-more efficient, we could theoretically pump out 
more and more value using the same— or, let’s be really ambitious here— 
fewer resources. 02:52So, how do we do that? How do we increase efficiency? With new technologies. 02:59This is where we hit a snag. 03:01New tech, in addition to making
things more efficient, can also generate new demand,
which ends up using more resources. 03:09We’re actually not in imminent danger
of running out of most resources. But we have a much bigger 
and more immediate problem: the global economy, and in particular
those of rich countries, is driving climate change and destroying
valuable natural environments on which all of us depend— soil, forests, fisheries, 
and countless other resources that help keep our civilization running. 03:33So, what should we do? 03:35This is where economists disagree. 03:38Most economists think that new ideas will
be able to fix most of these problems. They argue that, in the same way that exponentially 
increasing resource and energy use have fueled exponential
economic growth, human ingenuity has also
increased exponentially, and will rise to meet these challenges
in ways that we simply can't predict. For example, between 2000 and 2014, Germany grew their GDP by 16%,
while cutting CO2 emissions by 12%. 04:11That’s impressive, but it’s not cutting
emissions fast enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. For this reason and others, some economists think the solution is 
to reengineer our economies completely. They make the case that what we should
really be doing is weaning ourselves from the addiction to growth 
and shifting to a post-growth economy. 04:35What would that look like? A post-growth economy wouldn’t assume
that the economy should grow; instead, it would require us to focus
on improving what we really need— things like renewable energy, 
healthcare, and public transportation. To do that, post-growth economists
suggest that rich countries should do things like guarantee 
living wages, reduce wealth and income inequality, and ensure universal access 
to public services, like healthcare. In such an economy, people would be
theoretically less dependent on their jobs to earn their living or get healthcare, so it might be more feasible 
to scale down production of things deemed less necessary. 05:15But this raises other questions: 
who gets to define what’s necessary? How would we resolve 
the inevitable disagreements? Could we really do 
away with entire industries? 05:26The “we’ll come up with new ideas
to solve these problems” approach can seem as realistic as,
well, a magical gold coin. And the “we have to fundamentally change 
our economies” approach can seem politically daunting, 
particularly in rich countries. One way or another, we have to find 
a way to benefit everyone while also taking care of our planet."
3,The eco-creators helping the climate through social media,Zahra Biabani,Jul 2022,"""Climate doom-ism,"" or a pessimistic outlook on the future of the planet, rivals climate denialism in holding up the fight against climate change, says activist Zahra Biabani. Illuminating how hope combats inaction, she takes us inside the world of eco-friendly content on TikTok -- and shows that we all have what it takes to make real change.", (37K),"Transcript (9 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoNorsk bokmålPortuguês brasileiroالعربية中文 (简体)한국어00:01I recently graduated college where I studied environmental science
and environmental sociology. Now during one of my many,
many finals week study breaks, I came across something
that piqued my interest -- and it wasn’t something
I was supposed to be studying. It was a survey of 10,000 young people across ten different countries on their feelings regarding
the climate crisis. A survey found 
that 56 percent of Gen-Zers, the generation that I’m a part of and the largest
age demographic in the world, believe that because
of the climate crisis, humanity is doomed. This felt like a punch in the gut. I had just spent four and a half years and tens of thousands of dollars
studying these things: countless time organizing
on and off campus and energy getting involved
with both local and national groups, yet most of my generation
viewed it all as pointless. 00:53Now if we look at the way that younger
generations talk about the climate crisis, these feelings of doom
and despair make sense. I mean, we’re drowning
in bad climate news. Headline after headline detail
each week’s latest catastrophe. “Unprecedented” has taken on a new meaning
as each day is unprecedented. Just count how many times
you’ll probably hear it today. I gave you two ones for free right there. And everything is amplified
on social media where there’s a remarkable lack of nuance and an oversupply
of attention-grabbing rhetoric. Many of us, including myself, seem to believe that if we just share
these awareness posts enough times that someone somewhere
will finally do something about it. But unfortunately, Joe Biden probably
doesn't follow you on Instagram, and he doesn’t follow me either -- yet. 01:42I’m part of a diverse,
19-person-strong collective called EcoTok, and we use social media to share nuanced
climate education through infographics, memes and you guessed it, TikToks, to our collective audience
of over four million people, most of whom are Gen Z and millennials. 01:57And through our work, we’ve picked up on this pattern. Our comments sections are filled
with people who have given up hope. People who say they have
weekly anxiety attacks about the climate crisis. Or that they don’t want
to have kids anymore out of fear of adding to the suffering. Or that they see no point in taking action when the powers that stand
against us are so strong. 02:20Our generation and younger generations need a new way of addressing
the climate crisis that unshackles us
from the cycles of doom and gloom that so often lead to inaction, because we cannot
play a part in making change if we do not believe
that change is possible. Climate denialism, which for decades has been peddled by oil,
gas and other big business interests, has met its rival: climate doomism. The belief that we cannot save our planet, so why take action? Though they differ in origin, both have the ability to paralyze action
and prevent progress. And though things are bad, they’re far from over. 02:55So how do we find hope
when things feel hopeless, and how do we communicate the inextricable link
between hope and action? To answer this, let me take you back to March of 2020 -- absolutely no one’s first choice
of when to time travel to. Many of us were quarantined in our homes, people had stopped
going out and socializing, yet the stream and virality
of bad news certainly had not stopped. I was finishing up my semester at home, as well as working to move
my activism online when I was hit, not only with COVID but also with burnout. I began to question
the efficacy of my work, my passion for environmentalism and the purpose in studying
what I was studying. I knew I needed something to inspire me. I was scrolling on social media, and I saw a friend who had been
sharing positive news stories. I paired this with the rise of feel-good
dance videos that had really emerged on TikTok and started a series
called “Weekly Earth Wins.” Here's a look at one of those videos. 03:56(Music) 04:09(Applause) 04:13So at first this felt
really, really silly. I mean, what did dancing
have to do with climate action? And what good was sharing good news
when everything felt so bad? 04:23But then I began to receive
people's feedback. People told me that these videos really helped
mitigate their climate anxiety, that they looked forward
to these videos week after week and that these videos helped turn
their anger and anxiety into action. So I continued making them. And in the process of finding
good news stories to share, I began to pick up on trends. Week after week, institutions were divesting
from fossil fuels. Week after week, land was given back
to Indigenous communities. And week after week, states were implementing
renewable energy standards. I never overlooked the scientific
projections or data, but rather tuned in to the hard-to-find good news stories and examples of successful
on-the-ground work. And in the process, I uncovered the framework
that I had been yearning for: climate optimism. 05:16Climate optimism is a framework
based on the idea that despite the bleak projections
and the high stakes, we can restore our planet back to health, and in doing so, protect all that inhabit it. Climate optimism is what gives us hope
when things feel hopeless, is what sustains us
in our pursuit of sustainability and is what fuels us in the uphill battle
of transitioning away from fossil fuels. It’s also what gives us the energy
to continue fighting for our successes. Virtually, the zero-emissions
energy source that nobody talks about. 05:49So in this process, I realize also that climate optimism
is not for everybody. Climate optimism is not
for politicians who have stalled on action or corporations who have
incessantly pursued profits over people. To them, my message is clear: listen to science and act now. Stop failing the citizens and people
that you have a duty to serve. Rather, climate optimism
is for those of us here today ... that have dedicated our lives to fighting the greatest
battle of our time. But also to the part-time activists: those who do what they can, when they can. And perhaps most significantly, to the marginalized communities
and people in the Global South, who frankly don’t have time to get stuck
in the cycles of doom and gloom. 06:36The need for climate optimism
has never been more urgent. If we limit our vision of the future
to one filled with oil rigs, smokestacks and suffering, we limit our capacity and shirk our duty to change
the course of humanity for the better. By looking for good
and working towards the good, we empower ourselves to be agents of good in the fight for the future
that we deserve. The alternative -- giving up hope -- only relinquishes power into the very entities
that have gotten us into this mess. 07:06Luckily, I’m not alone
in championing this movement. My friends at EcoTok
provide a great example of a diverse set of backgrounds, experiences and voices coming together
to encourage this generation and the next. Here's a look at some of our work. 07:22(Video) Doria Brown: Canada is banning
six types of plastics. The plastics include grocery bags, stir sticks, six-pack rings, reusable food containers, straws and utensils. Now hopefully they put
some systems in place for some people who need those things
for accessibility purposes, but this is a step in the right direction, and I’m excited. 07:45Gabrielle Langhorn: From desertification
to bountiful vegetation, a community in Cearà, Brazil has been
able to rehabilitate their landscape using amazing collective action
and funding from FUNCEME. Water is flowing, crops are growing and you can truly see a difference. 08:01(Music) 08:02Carissa Cabrera: [Good Blue News!!] 08:04[The endangered Hawaiian Monk seal
population is up to ... over 1,500!] 08:12[This is the highest
it’s been in decades!] 08:18Henry Ferland: Welcome back,
it is me, Trash Boy. 08:21Every time I step outside I see trash
and litter on the ground, and I hate it! So let’s clean some up! I got my trash bag and gloves, let’s go. 08:27One, two, three, four, five. And all this trash in this grate, too. Much better. 08:34Storm grates like that is exactly
how trash enters the ocean, and we don’t want that. There are already over 5.25 trillion
pieces of trash in our oceans. Let’s not let in any more. 08:47(Applause and cheers) 08:53ZB: We’re not naive. We know the details and the data that speak to the devastation
of the climate crisis like the back of our hands because it's our future to inherit. But we also know that the future
we deserve cannot be built on the unstable foundations
of fear and anxiety. It must be built with one of the few infinite resources
that we have on this finite planet: hope. 09:17So we choose climate optimism. We choose to fight
for the future that we deserve. And I hope you will, too. 09:22Thank you. 09:24(Applause)"
3,The wheat field that could change the world,Guntur V. Subbarao,Nov 2022,"Crop physiologist Guntur V. Subbarao and his team have developed an antibiotic-infused strain of wheat that naturally combats harmful, fertilizer-eating bacteria -- a ""monster"" contributor to climate change. Learn more about how this breakthrough could once again revolutionize agriculture, increasing crop yields and protecting our planet at the same time.", (1.9K),"Transcript (3 Languages)EnglishTürkçe中文 (简体)00:00What you see over there is elite modern-day wheat lines that have a special ability to produce large amounts of antibiotics from the root systems. You may be wondering, why do we need antibiotics
from the wheat root systems? You only take antibiotics
when you are sick, isn't it? 00:29The agricultural systems, the modern farming systems have become increasingly sick lately. They are so sick that nearly 70 percent
of the nitrogen fertilizers that are being applied to farmlands are being leaked out. They're leaking nitrogen uncontrollably. If you look at the nitrogen
fertilizer consumption from the beginning of 
the Green Revolution, it has grown nearly 30 fold. From five million metric tons at the beginning of 
the Green Revolution, to 150 million metric tons, what we are currently using. A 30-fold increase in nitrogen
fertilizer consumption has resulted in a four-fold increase
in global food grain production. 01:28Of course, we all know that the Green Revolution has transformed
the global food grain production, saved us from famine, food scarcities, and provided the global food security. But you have to ask yourself. A 30-fold increase in nitrogen
fertilizer consumption is supporting only four-fold increase
in food grain production. What's happening? 02:06When you apply nitrogen fertilizers, it is mostly in ammonium form. Ammonium form binds
the soil, doesn't move. Doesn't create any harmful
nitrogen byproducts. There's no problem with ammonium nitrogen. But there is a little bacteria,
lives in the soil, that started eating away
this fertilizer, nitrogen ammonium, and spitting it out into nitrate. And also it's making many other harmful nitrogen byproducts. 02:46The problem with the nitrates is, though many plants can use nitrates
as a nitrogen source, but nitrogen cannot bind to the soil. It washes out. If you have rain, if you have irrigation, it washes out from the farmlands. That is the problem. This little bacteria [that] 
used to be a small, subdued microbial activity
in the soil biological activity, has grown now into a monster. It's consuming nearly 95 to 99
percent of the fertilizer nitrogen and splitting it out into nitrates. We should be asking, are we fertilizing our crops, or are we fertilizing this little bacteria which we have helped to grow
into a big monster? 03:46This is what happens when the nitrogen
moves into water streams, pollutes lakes, triggers algal blooms and creates another Green Revolution. If you don't keep
the nitrogen in farmlands, if you allow it to move
into the water bodies, to the larger ecosystem, it creates another Green Revolution
in a ecologically destructive way. 04:18If you look at the soil, it's a living biological system. An invisible microbial world. There's a large microbial universe
operating in these soil systems. They are involved in numerous functions, breaking down everything
into individual components, nourishing our crops to grow
and produce food. It's so complex. It's much, much bigger
than the ecosystem that we know, the ecosystem above
the ground that we know. It's much more complex. Just to give you an example, a gram of soil would have
about 10 billion microbial cells. Ten billion microbes in a gram of soil,
doing various functions. It's much larger than the entire
human population, what you see on Earth. 05:18This microbial universe is affected, affected so severely, from the last seven decades
of the Green Revolution. Particularly, the infusion of large amounts
of nitrogen fertilizers caused disruption
to this microbial activity and changed the population dynamics. As I said, what used to be a small, insignificant microbial
activity in the soil has grown into a monstrous proportion, sucking up all the fertilizer nitrogen
[that] we are applying. Nature has evolved many solutions to some of the problems
we are facing in agriculture and some of the problems
we are going to create and face in the future. 06:11What you see over there
is a Brachiaria tropical pasture grass. It grows extensively in South America. It has a unique ability. It produces large amounts of antibiotics
from the root systems. These antibiotics are specifically
directed to this little bacteria, we say the nitrifying bacteria. Because of that, it tightly controls this nitrifying bacteria
function in the soil. It doesn't allow it to function. It doesn't kill that bacteria, but it doesn’t allow it to function, just [keeps] them in a kind of coma state. Because of that, you don't see any kind
of nitrate formation in these tropical pastures. In particular,
this tropical pasture grass. And also, you don’t see any nitrogen gas
emitted from these pastures. No nitrous oxide is emitted
from these pastures because it controls
these bacteria so tightly by producing large amounts of antibiotics
from the root systems. 07:27The question is, how do we bring this kind of ability
into our crop lands? Most of our food production
comes from four crops: Wheat, maize, rice and sorghum. These are the four crop
that provide the global food security. Almost 80 to 90 percent of the food grains
are produced from these four crops. And also ... more than 90 percent of the entire nitrogen fertilizer
produced industrially goes to these four production systems. These food crops, the staple crops, don't have much ability. That's the reason they are leaking. 08:15So, if you look at this,
you see the wild wheat. It has the ability to produce
20 to 30 times antibiotics from the root systems. Our group has worked for the last 15 years to try and locate the genomic region responsible for producing
these antibiotics and transfer to the cultivated wheat. We have done it. You see that the orange, orange is here part of the chromosome
that is coming from the wild wheat, which is coding the antibiotics. We have got that integrated
to the wheat genome without disrupting the elite [agronomic]
architecture of the wheat system, and also without disrupting
the yield potential and without interfering with
the bread-making quality of the wheat. 09:12This new category of wheats
we call BNI-wheats, the wheats that can produce
large amounts of antibiotics from the root systems to control this bacteria so that they can control the nitrate
production in the root systems. Because of this, the nitrogen fertilizer,
whatever we are applying, would stay in the 
[root-zone], doesn’t leak. Look at the the BNI wheats,
well, it looks quite healthy and green. You see the right side, that is the current modern wheats, which leaks out all the nitrogen,
whatever we have applied. Both the plants were applied
the same amount of nitrogen at exactly the same time. In one case, it leaked out. In the other case,
it remained in the farmland. 10:01These are the BNI wheats. These are the next generation
wheats under development. So in a few years from now, they will be available to the farmers. So our hope is, in the next 10 years, most of the wheats that are grown
in different parts of the world would have this kind of ability so that the nitrogen leakage
can be stopped by infusing these large
amounts of antibiotics from the root systems. That’s what is going to control -- that’s what is going to reduce the amount
of nitrogen fertilizer in future ... in wheat root systems. 10:39Thank you. 10:40(Applause)"
3,Ecology from the air,Greg Asner,Nov 2013,"What are our forests really made of? From the air, ecologist Greg Asner uses a spectrometer and high-powered lasers to map nature in meticulous kaleidoscopic 3D detail -- what he calls ""a very high-tech accounting system"" of carbon. In this fascinating talk, Asner gives a clear message: To save our ecosystems, we need more data, gathered in new ways.", (24K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Technology can change our understanding of nature. 00:04Take for example the case of lions. For centuries, it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna, and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too, I can tell. Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions, and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill, and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances, usually during the day, male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation, and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation, and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting. 01:31I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how little
we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests, and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate, as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much, yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand? 01:56Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects, but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this, the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job, but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos of high-tech sensors, computers, and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique: one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers, very high-powered lasers, that fire out of the bottom of the plane, sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second in high-resolution 3D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge, we imaged it in 3D, captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon, imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see, for example, the 3D structure of the vegetation and the buildings, or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest, in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales, and what that means is that
they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological, and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy, but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species
that occupy the rainforest. 04:01Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer
from any other vantage point, such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those
questions with you today. The first questions is, how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests? Tropical forests contain a huge
amount of carbon in the trees, and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships, airplanes, trains 
and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation, but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing? Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system. With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows, obviously,
closed-canopy tropical forest, and then you see the cookie cutting, or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. 05:41We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you
on a high-resolution, first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks, your largest cathedral forests you can imagine, and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place, totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red, and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue, and the virus of deforestation
spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp
in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's ""Avatar."" We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries, Panama, and see also a huge range of carbon variation, from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately, most of the carbon
is lost in the lowlands, but what you see that's left, in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds, is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone
around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change. 07:29My second question: How do we
prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest? Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time in these places, and we're seeing
the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing, and what's really happening is
we're getting a lot of droughts, recurring droughts. The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area
about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas, these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example, these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil, totally unexplored, almost totally unknown scientifically. 08:22So what we think, as Earth scientists, is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their
exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in 3D, and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate
in a system like this, obviously. 08:57If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go. It's an amazing experience every time, no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way, on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river, imaged the system in 3D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case, we found gold mining activity, all of it illegal, set back away from the river's edge, as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry, we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many, many other problems in the region. 09:40So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique, important corridors like the western Amazon
and the Andes Amazon corridor, we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know
the geography of biodiversity in the region, if it's so unknown to science? So what we've been doing is using the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing
different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species, blues are another, and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level, we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat, and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans. 10:48And third and final question is, how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems? The example I started out
with about lions hunting, that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is, much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species
that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example, how much and where to use fire as a management tool? Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants, which may, if their populations get too large, have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you, these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line, now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants: dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger, the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you, and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that
the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa, for example, is allowing us to map every
single tree in the savanna, and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants, in the red as you see on the screen,
and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies
that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes
that I just showed you. So really, the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life, where we have fire management, elephant management, those impacts on
the structure of the ecosystem, and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. 13:03Going forward, I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then, you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet, but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. 13:26Thank you. 13:28(Applause)"
3,Why I still have hope for coral reefs,Kristen Marhaver,Jul 2017,"Corals in the Pacific Ocean have been dying at an alarming rate, particularly from bleaching brought on by increased water temperatures. But it's not too late to act, says TED Fellow Kristen Marhaver. She points to the Caribbean -- given time, stable temperatures and strong protection, corals there have shown the ability to survive and recover from trauma. Marhaver reminds us why we need to keep working to protect the precious corals we have left. ""Corals have always been playing ...", (41K),"Transcript (26 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаالعربيةहिन्दीမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00footnotefootnoteThe first time I cried underwater was in 2008, the island of Curaçao, way down in the southern Caribbean. It's beautiful there. I was studying these corals for my PhD, and after days and days
of diving on the same reef, I had gotten to know them as individuals. I had made friends with coral colonies -- totally a normal thing to do. Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
and ripped off their skin, leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing, and big patches of dead skeleton
that would get overgrown by algae. When I saw this damage for the first time, stretching all the way down the reef, I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear and I cried. If a coral could die that fast, how could a reef ever survive? And why was I making it my job
to try to fight for them? 00:51footnotefootnoteI never heard another scientist
tell that kind of story until last year. A scientist in Guam wrote, ""I cried right into my mask,"" seeing the damage on the reefs. Then a scientist in Australia wrote, ""I showed my students
the results of our coral surveys, and we wept."" Crying about corals
is having a moment, guys. 01:13(Laughter) 01:14footnotefootnoteAnd that's because reefs in the Pacific are losing corals faster
than we've ever seen before. Because of climate change, the water is so hot for so long
in the summers, that these animals
can't function normally. They're spitting out the colored algae
that lives in their skin, and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death and then rots away. Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae. 01:39footnotefootnoteThis is happening
over an unbelievable scale. The Northern Great Barrier Reef
lost two-thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles, then bleached again this year, and the bleaching stretched further south. Reefs in the Pacific
are in a nosedive right now, and no one knows
how bad it's going to get, except ... over in the Caribbean where I work, we've already been through the nosedive. Reefs there have suffered
through centuries of intense human abuse. We kind of already know
how the story goes. And we might be able to help predict
what happens next. 02:15Let's consult a graph. Since the invention of scuba, scientists have measured
the amount of coral on the seafloor, and how it's changed through time. And after centuries
of ratcheting human pressure, Caribbean reefs met one of three fates. Some reefs lost their corals very quickly. Some reefs lost their corals more slowly, but kind of ended up in the same place. OK, so far this is not going very well. But some reefs in the Caribbean -- the ones best protected and the ones a little
further from humans -- they managed to hold onto their corals. Give us a challenge. And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero. 03:04footnotefootnoteThe second time I cried underwater was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011. It was the calmest day of the year, but it's always pretty
sketchy diving there. My boyfriend and I swam against the waves. I watched my compass
so we could find our way back out, and he watched for sharks, and after 20 minutes of swimming
that felt like an hour, we finally dropped down to the reef, and I was so shocked, and I was so happy that my eyes filled with tears. There were corals 1,000 years old
lined up one after another. They had survived the entire history
of European colonialism in the Caribbean, and for centuries before that. 03:45footnotefootnoteI never knew what a coral could do
when it was given a chance to thrive. The truth is that even
as we lose so many corals, even as we go through
this massive coral die-off, some reefs will survive. Some will be ragged on the edge, some will be beautiful. And by protecting shorelines
and giving us food to eat and supporting tourism, they will still be worth
billions and billions of dollars a year. The best time to protect a reef
was 50 years ago, but the second-best time is right now. Even as we go through bleaching events, more frequent and in more places, some corals will be able to recover. 04:26footnotefootnoteWe had a bleaching event
in 2010 in the Caribbean that took off big patches of skin
on boulder corals like these. This coral lost half of its skin. But if you look at the side
of this coral a few years later, this coral is actually healthy again. It's doing what a healthy coral does. It's making copies of its polyps, it's fighting back the algae and it's reclaiming its territory. If a few polyps survive, a coral can regrow; it just needs time and protection
and a reasonable temperature. Some corals can regrow in 10 years -- others take a lot longer. But the more stresses
we take off them locally -- things like overfishing,
sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution, dredging, coastal construction -- the better they can hang on
as we stabilize the climate, and the faster they can regrow. 05:17footnotefootnoteAnd as we go through the long,
tough and necessary process of stabilizing the climate
of planet Earth, some new corals will still be born. This is what I study in my research. We try to understand
how corals make babies, and how those babies
find their way to the reef, and we invent new methods
to help them survive those early, fragile life stages. One of my favorite
coral babies of all time showed up right after Hurricane Omar. It's the same species
I was studying before the storm, but you almost never see
babies of this species -- it's really rare. This is actually an endangered species. In this photo, this little baby coral,
this little circle of polyps, is a few years old. Like its cousins that bleach, it's fighting back the algae. And like its cousins on the north shore, it's aiming to live for 1,000 years. 06:09footnotefootnoteWhat's happening in the world
and in the ocean has changed our time horizon. We can be incredibly pessimistic
on the short term, and mourn what we lost and what we really took for granted. But we can still be optimistic
on the long term, and we can still be ambitious
about what we fight for and what we expect from our governments, from our planet. Corals have been living on planet Earth
for hundreds of millions of years. They survived the extinction
of the dinosaurs. They're badasses. 06:40(Laughter) 06:41footnotefootnoteAn individual coral can go through
tremendous trauma and fully recover if it's given a chance
and it's given protection. Corals have always
been playing the long game, and now so are we. 06:55Thanks very much. 06:56(Applause)"
3,Why are blue whales so enormous?,Asha de Vos,Feb 2013,"Blue whales are the largest animals on the planet, but what helps them grow to the length of a basketball court? Asha de Vos explains why the size of krill make them the ideal food for the blue whale -- it's as if the blue whale was made to eat krill (and krill was made to be eaten by the blue whale). [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by Asha de Vos].", (28K),"Transcript (26 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeМонголРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةکوردی سۆرانیதமிழ்ภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Andrea McDonough, TranslatorBedirhan Cinar, Reviewer00:31Blue whales are the largest animals
that have ever roamed the planet. They’re at least two times 
as big as the biggest dinosaurs— “that’s big!“— the length of a basketball court, and as heavy as 40 African elephants. 00:44If that’s not enough to make you marvel,
here’s something that will. They’ve grown to this enormous size by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like
creatures called krill— that are no bigger 
than your little finger. In many ways, the sheer size of krill seems to have driven 
the evolution of the blue whale. 01:08See, krill are so small
but are found in dense patches. For increased efficiency, blue whales have evolved to use 
a feeding strategy called lunge feeding. Basically, 
the whale accelerates towards a prey patch and opens its mouth wide. To increase the capacity, 
its mouth expands. The special, accordion-like 
blubber layer that extends from its snout 
to its belly button enables the whale to engulf 
large quantities of prey-laden water. 01:42With each giant gulp, the whale takes in 125% of its body weight
in water and krill. The whale must then expel the water
while retaining the yummy krill. To do this, it uses its baleen, the comb-like structure made of the same 
stuff our nails and hair are made of, and its tongue. 02:08It’s pretty crazy that the blue whale’s 
heart is as big as a small car, a child could crawl through its arteries, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, but its esophagus is so small, the whale could choke on a loaf of bread. These whales are really not designed 
to feed on anything larger than krill. 02:31It’s estimated that blue whales eat 
four tons of krill per day. Because of their incredible design, each dive provides the blue whale 
with 90 times as much energy as is used. Every mouthful of krill provides 
almost 480,000 calories, the same amount you get 
from eating 1,900 hamburgers. 02:54But, why are blue whales so big? Blue whales are considerably larger
than the largest living land animal, the elephant. The heavier an animal is, the greater its relative surface area. As weight increases, there’s a point at which the legs 
of that animal would simply collapse. That explains why elephants don’t stand 
on the delicate legs of a horse. They need legs shaped like stout pedestals to hold their bodies up against gravity. 03:25In water, the situation 
is quite different. Buoyancy counteracts 
the gravitational pull on the body and their great bulk is therefore 
partially supported by the water. So, the ocean is a great place for species
that want to grow bigger. 03:39The other secret to their size
is their diet. By evolving such a huge mouth, the whale’s have specialized to catch 
enormous quantities of highly abundant and nutritious prey, which provides the energy needed 
to grow so big. 03:56But, now maybe you’re wondering
why blue whales aren’t any bigger? After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana
for any growing beast. Well, while lunge feeding may 
have allowed blue whales to become the biggest animal 
to have ever roamed the planet, by enabling them to feed efficiently 
in dense prey patches, it isn't cost free. Scientists compared all the costs 
involved with lunge feeding to the energy gained 
from the krill they eat. What they found is that when the whale’s 
body increases in size, the energy that body demands rises faster than the extra energy they get 
from their food. Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy 
required to remain still and 5 times more energy 
than used when swimming. 04:45Calculations show that the largest 
a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters, pretty much blue whale size. Turns out blue whales have a lot
to thank krill for: neat, evolutionary adaptations that would 
not have been possible if krill were not so small. It’s incredible that these tiny creatures 
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits 
of size on our planet. 05:07Makes you wonder if that old adage, 
“you are what you eat,” really does apply in blue whale world."
3,The lovable (and lethal) sea lion,Claire Simeone,May 2019,"Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling awkwardly across the beach, it's easy to think of sea lions more as sea house cats. But don't be fooled by their beachside behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are incredible endurance hunters, reaching speeds of 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time. Claire Simeone dives into what makes these majestic mammals such resourceful foragers.

awkwardly across the beach, it’s easy to think of these immobile 
mammals less as sea lions, and more as sea house cats. But don’t be fooled by their 
beachside behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are 
incredible endurance hunters. Hurtling around at speeds from 
4 to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time, these majestic mammals live 
up to their name. And thanks to a suite of 
physical adaptations, finely tuned over millions of years, 
they make for resourceful foragers. 00:47To find their favorite food, sea lions hunt much deeper than 
many of their semi-aquatic peers. With some species diving to 
depths of nearly 400 meters, they’re able to cope with 
the mounting pressure by collapsing their pliable rib cage, 
and compressing a pair of springy lungs. This pushes air up through 
the smaller airways, collapsing rings of cartilage as 
oxygen travels out from the lungs, to be held in the larger, upper airways. Upon surfacing, this air will be 
used to re-inflate the lungs, but for now their heart slows 
down to preserve oxygen. Blood flow is redirected towards 
only the most essential organs like the heart, lungs, and brain, which rely on reserve oxygen 
stored in blood and muscle. 01:33Once they arrive at their hunting ground, sea lions depend on their superior 
vision to find their prey. Most mammal eyes have 
a structure called a lens– a transparent, convex structure whose 
shape refracts light to enable sight. In humans, this lens is curved to process 
light waves traveling through air. But sea lions need to see their 
best at hundreds of meters deep. To accommodate, their eyes have a much 
rounder lens to refract light underwater, as well as teardrop-shaped pupils which can expand to 25 times 
their original size. This lets in as much light as possible, helping them pinpoint their prey in 
even the dimmest conditions. 02:14But once they’ve closed in, they rely on something akin to a sixth 
sense to actually catch their meal. Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are composed of keratin 
and full of nerve fibers that run deep into the connective 
tissue of their face. Sea lions have full directional control 
over these whiskers, which can lie flat against their face, 
or stick out at a 90-degree angle. When properly tuned, these whiskers can sense the slim trails 
of moving water fish leave in their wake. And they’re precise enough to let 
blindfolded sea lions tell the difference between objects less 
than two centimeters different in size. 02:54With these tools a healthy sea lion can
catch generous helpings of fish such as anchovy, mackerel, 
and squid on every outing. And with their exceptional memories, they 
can remember multiple hunting grounds, including those they haven’t 
visited in decades. This memory also extends to breeding 
territories and birthing areas, as well as which neighbors 
are friend and foe. There’s even evidence that sea lions 
can remember how to perform tasks after 10 years with no 
practice in between, letting them navigate old stomping 
grounds with ease. 03:27Yet despite these incredible adaptations, there are changes unfolding 
in their habitats too rapidly for sea lions to handle. As climate change warms the oceans, 
certain toxic algae species thrive. This algae is harmless to 
the fish who eat it, but for the sea lions which 
ingest those fish, the algae’s domoic acid can trigger 
seizures and brain damage. Changing ocean conditions keep 
this algae blooming year round, causing more and more sea lions 
to wash up on beaches. 03:58This tragic discovery is just one 
of the many ways the health of aquatic animal 
communities can help us better understand Earth’s oceans. These red flags help us take action to protect ourselves and other 
maritime mammals. And the more we can learn about the 
changing ocean that sea lions inhabit, the better equipped we’ll be to help 
these clever creatures thrive."

because the climate countdown has begun, and we are nowhere near
where we need to be. Science tells us
we must limit to global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels. We are on track
for three degrees at least. 00:19Billions of people around the world are already suffering
from our failure to act. Climate disruption, due to our outdated
addiction to fossil fuels, is causing unprecedented wildfires, more intense and frequent cyclones, floods, droughts,
and other weather extremes. Toxic air pollution is choking
our major cities and harming our health, and biodiversity on land and sea
is under growing pressure. 00:47No country's immune
from the climate crisis. But in every country, it is the poorest and most vulnerable
who are hardest hit, despite having done least
to cause the problem. Over the past 25 years, the richest 10 percent
of the global population has been responsible for more than half
of all carbon emissions, and the poorest 50 percent were responsible for just
seven percent of emissions. Rank injustice and inequality
of this scale is a cancer. If we don't act now, this century
may be one of humanity's last. 01:23The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the fundamental injustices
and inequality of our societies. The upheaval of this pandemic presents an opportunity
to chart a new course, one that can address every aspect
of the climate crisis head-on. History shows that when we grab
such moments, we can succeed. We can build a safer, fairer,
more resilient world. But we need to move quickly. 01:48That is why I'm urging governments to take six climate-positive actions
to recover better together: Invest in green jobs; do not bail out polluting
industries, especially coal; end fossil fuel subsidies,
and put a price on carbon; take climate risks into account
in all financial and policy decisions; work together in solidarity; and most important, leave no one behind. 02:12This is the course of action
that thousands of companies, cities, states, regions,
universities, and investors are already choosing
by committing to net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. They are moving to protect
people and our planet. Momentum is building. 02:29Cities and regions with a carbon footprint
greater than the United States and companies with revenues
of more than 11.4 trillion US dollars have now committed
to net-zero emissions by 2050. That's doubled the number
from when this initiative was launched at the Climate Action Summit in 2019. Likewise, investors managing
over four trillion US dollars have joined the race to zero. This number has also more than doubled since the initiative was first launched
at the same summit. 03:02But it is still necessary for governments to create the tax
and regulatory frameworks that will further stimulate
climate action by the private sector. European Union has announced
plans to cut its emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. And China has recently
announced its intention to become carbon neutral before 2060. I now count on these
and other main emitters to present before COP26
concrete plans and policies that will bring the world
to carbon neutrality by 2050. 03:36We must make sure that each country, each city, company, bank,
and international organization has a transition plan
to reach zero net emissions. We also need to see much greater efforts to build resilience
in vulnerable countries, which do least to cause climate change
but bear the worst impacts. In the big coastal deltas, the islands of the Pacific
and the Caribbean, and dry lands such as
the Africa Sahel region, we must help people
adapt to climate impacts as they recover from COVID-19. 04:08I call on developed countries
to meet their commitment to mobilize 100 billion US dollars a year for mitigation, adaptation,
and resilience in developing countries. We must work to create
the conditions needed for a massive mobilization of funds. Also from financial institutions
and private investors. We must keep building climate ambition. 04:29On the fifth anniversary
of the Paris Agreement in December, leaders from government,
business, and civil society will gather online to do just that. We need to kickstart the race
to the Glasgow Climate Conference in 2021. To those who have already
joined the race, I applaud you, but I also ask you
to do more and much faster. You have raised your ambition
and your commitment. We need you now to also raise your voices
and push governments to do better, especially those who emit the most. 05:01To those yet to join,
my message is simple: We can only win the race to zero together. So I urge you all to get on board. 05:10The countdown has begun."

one animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem. 00:36Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures, which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies that house and protect 
countless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life. 01:16Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact. 02:02This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. 02:39Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system 
of social networks, parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive— and more of these fish 
means less seaweed. 03:32Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed. 04:06Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research, while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems."

is the Mosquitia Rain Forest in Honduras. I've done archaeological fieldwork
all over the world, so I thought I knew what to expect
venturing into the jungle, but I was wrong. For the first time
in my life, I might add. 00:17(Laughter) 00:20First of all, it's freezing. It's 90 degrees, but you're
soaking wet from the humidity, and the canopy of trees is so thick
that sunlight never reaches the surface. You can't get dry. Immediately, I knew that
I hadn't brought enough clothing. That first night, I kept feeling things
moving underneath my hammock, unknown creatures brushing and poking
against the thin nylon fabric. And I could barely sleep
through all the noise. The jungle is loud. It's shockingly loud. It's like being downtown
in a bustling city. 00:55As the night wore on, I became increasingly frustrated
with my sleeplessness, knowing I had a full day ahead. When I finally got up at dawn, my sense of unseen things
was all too real. There were hoofprints, paw prints, linear snake tracks everywhere. And what's even more shocking, we saw those same animals in the daylight, and they were completely unafraid of us. They had no experience with people. They had no reason to be afraid. 01:26As I walked toward the undocumented city,
my reason for being there, I realized that this was the only place
that I had ever been where I didn't see
a single shred of plastic. That's how remote it was. Perhaps it's surprising to learn that there are still places on our planet
that are so untouched by people, but it's true. There are still hundreds of places
where people haven't stepped for centuries or maybe forever. 01:56It's an awesome time
to be an archaeologist. We have the tools and the technology to understand our planet
like never before. And yet, we're running out of time. The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our ecological and cultural patrimony. I feel an urgency to my work that I didn't feel 20 years ago. How can we document everything
before it's too late? 02:25I was trained as
a traditional archaeologist using methodologies that
have been around since the '50s. That all changed in July of 2009 in Michoacán, Mexico. I was studying the ancient
Purépecha Empire, which is a lesser known
but equally important contemporary of the Aztec. Two weeks earlier, my team
had documented an unknown settlement, so we were painstakingly mapping,
building foundations by hand -- hundreds of them. 02:56Basic archaeological protocol
is to find the edge of a settlement so you know what you're dealing with, and my graduate students
convinced me to do just that. So I grabbed a couple of CLIF Bars,
some water, a walkie, and I set out alone on foot, expecting to encounter ""the edge""
in just a few minutes. A few minutes passed. And then an hour. Finally, I reached
the other side of the malpais. Oh, there were ancient
building foundations all the way across. It's a city? Oh, shit. 03:30(Laughter) 03:31It's a city. 03:33footnotefootnoteTurns out that this
seemingly small settlement was actually an ancient urban megalopolis, 26 square kilometers in size, with as many building foundations
as modern-day Manhattan, an archaeological settlement so large that it would take me
decades to survey fully, the entire rest of my career, which was exactly how I didn't want
to spend the entire rest of my career -- 04:01(Laughter) 04:02sweating, exhausted, placating stressed-out
graduate students -- 04:08(Laughter) 04:09tossing scraps of PB and J sandwiches to feral dogs, which is pointless, by the way, because Mexican dogs
really don't like peanut butter. 04:19(Laughter) 04:22Just the thought of it bored me to tears. 04:26footnotefootnoteSo I returned home to Colorado, and I poked my head
through a colleague's door. ""Dude, there's gotta be a better way."" He asked if I had heard
of this new technology called LiDAR -- Light Detection And Ranging. I looked it up. LiDAR involves shooting
a dense grid of laser pulses from an airplane to the ground's surface. What you end up with
is a high-resolution scan of the earth's surface
and everything on it. It's not an image, but instead it's a dense,
three-dimensional plot of points. We had enough money in the scan, so we did just that. The company went to Mexico, they flew the LiDAR and they sent back the data. 05:06Over the next several months, I learned
to practice digital deforestation, filtering away trees, brush
and other vegetation to reveal the ancient
cultural landscape below. 05:18When I looked at my first visualization, I began to cry, which I know comes
as quite a shock to you, given how manly I must seem. 05:27(Laughter) 05:30In just 45 minutes of flying, the LiDAR had collected
the same amount of data as what would have taken decades by hand: every house foundation, building, road and pyramid, incredible detail, representing the lives
of thousands of people who lived and loved and died
in these spaces. And what's more, the quality of the data wasn't comparable to traditional
archaeological research. It was much, much better. I knew that this technology would change
the entire field of archaeology in the coming years, and it did. 06:10Our work came to the attention
of a group of filmmakers who were searching for a legendary
lost city in Honduras. They failed in their quest, but they instead documented
an unknown culture, now buried under a pristine
wilderness rain forest, using LiDAR. I agreed to help interpret their data, which is how I found myself deep
in that Mosquitia jungle, plastic-free and filled
with curious animals. 06:39footnotefootnoteOur goal was to verify
that the archaeological features we identified in our LiDAR were actually there on the ground, and they were. Eleven months later, I returned
with a crack team of archaeologists sponsored by the
National Geographic Society and the Honduran government. In a month, we excavated over 400 objects from what we now call
the City of the Jaguar. 07:05We felt a moral and ethical responsibility
to protect this site as it was, but in the short time that we were there, things inevitably changed. The tiny gravel bar where we first
landed our helicopter was gone. The brush had been cleared away
and the trees removed to create a large landing zone
for several helicopters at once. Without it, after just one rainy season, the ancient canals that we
had seen in our LiDAR scan were damaged or destroyed. And the Eden I described
soon had a large clearing, central camp, lights and an outdoor chapel. In other words, despite our best efforts
to protect the site as it was, things changed. Our initial LiDAR scan
of this City of the Jaguar is the only record of this place
as it existed just a few years ago. 08:03And broadly speaking, this is a problem for archaeologists. We can't study an area
without changing it somehow, and regardless, the earth is changing. Archaeological sites are destroyed. History is lost. 08:19Just this year, we watched in horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral
went up in flames. The iconic spire collapsed, and the roof was all but destroyed. Miraculously, the art historian
Andrew Tallon and colleagues scanned the cathedral in 2010 using LiDAR. At the time, their goal was to understand
how the building was constructed. Now, their LiDAR scan is the most
comprehensive record of the cathedral, and it'll prove invaluable
in the reconstruction. They couldn't have anticipated the fire or how their scan would be used, but we're lucky to have it. 08:57footnotefootnoteWe take for granted that our cultural
and ecological patrimony will be around forever. It won't. Organizations like SCI-Arc
and Virtual Wonders are doing incredible work to record the world's historic monuments, but nothing similar exists
for the earth's landscapes. We've lost 50 percent of our rain forests. We lose 18 million acres
of forest every year. And rising sea levels will make cities,
countries and continents completely unrecognizable. Unless we have a record of these places, no one in the future
will know they existed. If the earth is the Titanic, we've struck the iceberg, everyone's on deck and the orchestra is playing. The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our cultural and ecological patrimony within decades. But sitting on our hands and doing nothing is not an option. Shouldn't we save everything
we can on the lifeboats? 10:01(Applause) 10:09footnotefootnoteLooking at my scans
from Honduras and Mexico, it's clear that we need
to scan, scan, scan now as much as possible, while we still can. That's what inspired the Earth Archive, an unprecedented scientific effort to LiDAR-scan the entire planet, starting with areas
that are most threatened. 10:32Its purpose is threefold. Number one: create a baseline record
of the earth as it exists today to more effectively mitigate
the climate crisis. To measure change, you need
two sets of data: a before and an after. Right now, we don't have
a high-resolution before data set for much of the planet, so we can't measure change, and we can't evaluate
which of our current efforts to combat the climate crisis are making a positive impact. 11:05Number two: create a virtual planet so that any number of scientists
can study our earth today. Archaeologists like me
can look for undocumented settlements. Ecologists can study tree size, forest composition and age. Geologists can study hydrology, faults, disturbance. The possibilities are endless. 11:32Number three: preserve
a record of the planet for our grandchildren's grandchildren, so they can reconstruct and study
lost cultural patrimony in the future. As science and technology advance, they'll apply new tools, algorithms, even AI to LiDAR scans done today, and ask questions that we
can't currently conceive of. 11:59Like Notre Dame, we can't imagine how these
records will be used. But we know that they'll
be critically important. The Earth Archive is the ultimate gift
to future generations, because the truth be told, I won't live long enough
to see its full impact, and neither will you. That's exactly why it's worth doing. The Earth Archive is a bet
on the future of humanity. It's a bet that together, collectively, as people and as scientists, that we'll face the climate crisis and that we'll choose
to do the right thing, not just for us today but to honor those who came before us and to pay it forward
to future generations who will carry on our legacy. 12:57Thank you. 12:58(Applause)"
3,The surprisingly long history of electric cars,Daniel Sperling and Gil Tal,Oct 2021,"By the end of the 19th century, nearly 40% of American cars were electric. But these vehicles had a few major problems — early car batteries were expensive and inefficient, and the vehicles were twice the price of a gas-powered car. And so for the next several decades, gas-powered cars dominated the market. Can electric cars reclaim their place on the road? Daniel Sperling and Gil Tal investigate. [Directed Lobster Studio, narrated Jack Cutmore-Scott, music by Fabrizio Martini].", (13K),"Transcript (24 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCrnogorskiEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNorsk bokmålPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیहिन्दीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:06If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major
options to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines
in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises
and foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably
option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,
clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access 
to electricity, easy to refuel overnight. 00:58If this seems like an easy choice,
you're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, 
nearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were 
a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive 
competitors. But electric vehicles had one
major problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive
and inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries 
that stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations 
in urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow
electric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price 
of a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. 01:49At the same time, oil discoveries
lowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion
engines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need
for hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and 
rubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car 
that captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars
on the road had plummeted. 02:23For the next 55 years, internal combustion
engines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,
electric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, 
the tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed
interest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking 
car emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments 
and environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. 02:56At this point, car companies had spent
decades investing in internal combustion engines 
without devoting any resources to solving the century-old 
battery problem. But other companies were developing
increasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave 
of portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal
hydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates 
by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave
of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize 
the efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, 
automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel 
more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. 04:04Since then, electric vehicles have 
vastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster
than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still
have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money
in the long run. As governments around the world focus 
on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected 
to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 
were plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s
Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive 
CO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments 
in gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim 
their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview."
3,The life cycle of a pair of jeans,Madhavi Venkatesan,Nov 2021,"The first pairs of jeans were designed for durability; denim was constructed as a sturdy weave worn by sailors and miners. But over the course of the 20th century, as the demand for jeans has gone up, their durability has gone down. Today, most pairs last no longer than a year. And each new pair you buy has a much higher cost than you might think. Madhavi Venkatesan traces the life cycle of jeans. [Directed by Sofia Pashaei, narrated by Pen-Pen Chen, music by Salil Bhayani, cAMP S...", (10K),"Transcript (31 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیमराठीहिन्दीதமிழ்မြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:06The first pairs of jeans were
designed for durability. Named for the French city of Nîmes, denim was constructed as a sturdy
cotton weave worn by sailors. This rugged material got even stronger
in the 19th century, when Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis added
metal rivets to reinforce stress points. Their design introduced a new brand
of durable trousers for California miners that could 
withstand years of wear and tear. Over the course of the 20th century, these working-class pants have transformed
into fashion icons. But as the demand for jeans has gone up,
their durability has gone down. Today, most pairs last 
no longer than a year. And each new pair you buy has a much
higher cost than you might think. 00:51Every pair of jeans begins 
its life in a cotton field. It takes about 0.7 kilograms of cotton
to produce a single pair of pants. Growing this much cotton requires
roughly 10,000 liters of water, not to mention various herbicides
and pesticides, which can contaminate groundwater. The cotton is harvested by hand
or industrial machines and transported to textile factories
where it’s spun into yarn. At this point, it’s typically combined
with plastic fibers like spandex to increase the yarn’s elasticity. These plastic threads make modern jeans
more comfortable and flexible, but also much less durable. 01:31Next, the yarn is dyed 
jeans’ trademark blue. Historically, this color came 
from natural plant-derived indigo. But most modern manufacturers 
use a synthetic dye made from petroleum byproducts 
and toxic chemicals. Once dyed, the cotton-plastic blend
is woven into denim sheets, which are then cut and sewn into jeans. After assembly, some jeans undergo 
additional procedures to get a distressed look. This often includes chemical sprays
and multiple cycles of acid-washing, the toxic runoff can turn rivers 
indigo-blue. Finally, there are the zippers, 
buttons, and rivets made of copper and other metals, whose mining is yet another source
of environmental degradation. All in all, the manufacturing process 
for a single pair of jeans emits over 33 kilograms of carbon— the equivalent of driving
over 110 kilometers. 02:24But this process doesn't just
damage the environment. Much of the world’s cotton is grown 
in developing countries, with poor labor practices 
and few protections for workers. Cotton here is often picked 
by children or forced labor, and most jean manufacturing plants
frequently expose workers to toxic chemicals throughout production. One particularly dangerous technique
called sandblasting involves spraying jeans with fine sand 
at high pressures and has been linked with numerous cases 
of incurable and often fatal lung disease. 02:57Like many globally produced products, jeans are made in poor countries
and bought in rich ones. All these pants will likely be washed
dozens or even hundreds of times per year. This energy intensive process breaks down
the plastics woven into each pair, releasing microplastics into the water and, perhaps most ironic of all, 
shortening the jean’s lifespan. Like most waste, discarded jeans 
end up in landfills, where their decomposition 
releases methane gas, while their dyes and plastics leach
into the soil and groundwater. 03:28Some companies are working
on solutions here, from using organic cotton 
to recycling and reusing denim. You can also help reduce the environmental
impact of your favorite pants by buying used jeans 
and buying fewer pairs altogether. Denim manufacturers also recommend only
washing your jeans once every 10 wears. And, when possible, air dry your pants
to reduce energy consumption. 03:51Life cycle and labor problems like these
extend far beyond just jeans. Some governments are pursuing policies
to make companies more responsible for worker pay and welfare, but unsustainable practices still run
rampant throughout the fashion industry. So when the price tags on your
clothes seem like a steal, it’s important to consider 
who’s actually being robbed."
